McCarthy, Jon Pareles and Giovanni Russonello Dec. 26, 2018 DAVID AMRAM There’s no more suitable send-off for the Cornelia Street Café — which will close next week after 41 years as a home of offbeat poetry, jazz, cabaret and theater in Greenwich Village — than a David Amram show. A remarkable musical polymath and conservationist of beatnik culture, he has played at the club monthly for 13 years and has come to epitomize its essence. At 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, Manhattan; 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Giovanni Russonello) AS THE CROW FLIES AND THE MARCUS KING BAND Chris Robinson has had a prolific career outside the Black Crowes, whose throwback British blues-rock made them a multimillion-selling band in the 1990s; the band announced its breakup in 2015. But hits are hits, and Robinson has put together As the Crow Flies to play them along with some cover songs — probably in jammier versions than the originals. The Marcus King Band, a Southern-rock group with a horn section, shares the bill. Dec. 30 at 8 p.m., New Year’s Eve at 10 p.m. at the Capitol Theatre, Port Chester, N.Y.; 877-987-648, thecapitoltheatre.com. (Jon Pareles) A SWING SWANG SWINGIN’ NEW YEAR’S EVE Jim Caruso, the buoyant showman who brings Broadway, jazz and cabaret talent to Monday-night open mics, hosts a holiday special showcasing the fluid and charismatic vocalists Veronica Swift, Gabrielle Stravelli and Benny Benack III, and the musical theater veteran Lesli Margherita. (Swift will do double duty, also performing a few numbers with the Birdland Big Band in a separate 11 p.m. set.) They’ll join forces at 8 and 11 p.m., accompanied by the pianist Matt Baker, the bassist Pat O’Leary and the drummer Curtis Nowosad, along with hats, horns, balloons, a complimentary champagne toast and an à la carte menu. At Birdland, Manhattan; 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.

(Gardner) BON BON BURLESQUE The Puerto Rico-born, Bronx-bred choreographer, performer and fitness guru Marlyn Ortiz, who is also Madonna’s personal trainer, found time to co-create (with choreographer Emmanuel E. Hernandez) and direct this group of professional dancers in a show that sets traditional and neo-burlesque elements to Latin rhythms. Performances begin at 9 p.m., with D.J. Miss Dakota providing music, and “cigarette girls” dispensing candy; tarot card readings are also on offer. The evening starts at 8 p.m. and includes a four-hour open bar, with a three-course dinner available before the show, beginning at 5 p.m. At the Green Room 42, Manhattan; 646- 449-7792, theGreenRoom42.com. (Gardner) CHRIS BOTTI A genteel crowd-pleaser, Botti plays trumpet as if swimming through his band’s sound — that is, he sounds like he’s defying gravity, but not achieving any kind of liftoff. More than jazz or pop, the genre that suits him best might be holiday music, so it makes sense that he’s held down a December residency at the Blue Note for the last 14 years. He appears here with a nine-piece band. At 7 and 10 p.m., the Blue Note, Manhattan; 212-475-8592, bluenotejazz.com. (Russonello) Image Yamaneika Saunders can be seen on Netflix this fall as one of “The Degenerates,” and at Carolines on New Year’s Eve as part of an all-star stand-up showcase.CreditComedy Central CHARLES BUSCH AND AARON TVEIT Busch, a drag icon, will be “dressed as my own wonderfully androgynous self” for “New Year’s Eve with Charles Busch and Friends.” The creator and star of “Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,” “Psycho Beach Party,” “Die, Mommie, Die!” and other evocatively named, adorably outré plays and films (he also wrote the Tony Award-nominated “The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife”) will hold court at 7 p.m. with his musical director, Tom Judson, and a bevy of Broadway vets: Andréa Burns, Peter Flynn and Howard McGillin, along with the actress and comedian Ashley Austin Morris. The robust-voiced Tveit, whose own credits include “Next to Normal,” “Wicked” and the Broadway-bound stage adaptation of “Moulin Rouge!” will follow at 11 p.m.; the cover charge includes a two-course prix fixe dinner, dessert buffet and open bar. (Premium seats include a half bottle of champagne per party and an individual dessert.) At Feinstein’s/54 Below, Manhattan; 646-476-3551, 54below.com. (Gardner) THE CITYFOX ODYSSEY This 27-hour electronic marathon extends all the way through New Year’s Day at Avant-Gardner, which has a lineup of more than two dozen house and techno D.J.s, among them Lee Burridge, Honey Dijon, Tale of Us, Patrice Baumel and, promising a “hybrid set,” WhoMadeWho. The beats may turn minimal, but they will continue quite awhile. At 9 p.m., Avant-Gardner, Brooklyn; avant-gardner.com. (Pareles) CLUB CUMMING NEW YEAR’S EVE BALL The East Village night spot’s co-owner Alan Cumming, the versatile actor, entertainer and eternally impish host, will join guests including the singer/songwriter Jill Sobule, the night-life mainstay performer Daphne Always, the drag provocateuse Christeene and the burlesque diva Velvetina Taylor. Festivities begin at 9 p.m., with the Club Cumming Orchestra in residence until midnight; service then continues, with D.J.s Sammy Jo and Darren Dryden holding forth, until 8 a.m. New Year’s Day. At Club Cumming, Manhattan; 800-838-3006, clubcummingnyc.com.

It plays the full sets from specific nights of the Dead’s 50-year itinerary, and some audience members can probably name the original date. On Dec. 30 and New Year’s Eve at 8 p.m., Wellmont Theater, Montclair, N.J.; 973-783-9500, wellmonttheater.com. (Pareles) JOHN DIGWEED After six years, the durable Williamsburg dance club Output is closing following this New Year’s Eve party that goes until 8 a.m. John Digweed — the long-running British house D.J., producer and label head — will provide the soundtrack for this farewell event, putting both the year and the club to bed. With Tara Brooks, Desna, Chilly Mox and Alex Raouf. At 10 p.m., Output, Brooklyn; outputclub.com. (Jon Caramanica) NATALIE DOUGLAS A witty, ebullient entertainer with a sweetly dusky, soulful voice, and a winner of 10 MAC (Manhattan Association of Cabarets & Clubs) Awards, Douglas will mark her 20th anniversary ringing in the new year with reflections on the year gone by and a mix of familiar and new material. She’ll take requests, too. “A Very Natalie New Year” unfolds at 7:30 p.m., then again at 10:45 p.m., with music direction by Mark Hartman. At the Duplex, Manhattan; 212-255-5438, theduplex.com. (Gardner) ‘EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE!’S NEW YEAR’S EVE IN NEW YORK CITY!’ Best known for collecting hilariously awful videos (and, in a related yet unrelated project, amassing the world’s largest pile of “Jerry Maguire” VHS tapes), the Everything Is Terrible performance group will present this all-ages bash featuring all-new video finds, free merchandise, a photo booth and an after-show dance party. (Those under 18 will need a parent or guardian.) At 9 p.m., Brooklyn Bazaar, Brooklyn; bkbazaar.com. (Sean L. McCarthy) Image Macy Gray will perform two sets at the Iridium.CreditScott Dudelson/Getty Images for ABA GOV’T MULE Warren Haynes, the guitarist, singer and songwriter of Gov’t Mule, is a jam band all-star who has done long stints with both the Allman Brothers Band and the Dead. His own band plays dark, low-slung Southern rock that borders on grunge, facing down dark thoughts with bluesy determination. On Dec. 29 at 8 p.m. and Dec. 31 at 9 p.m. at the Beacon Theater, Manhattan; 212-465-6500, msg.com/beacon-theatre. (Pareles) MACY GRAY Twenty years ago, before the Motown-sound revival (Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse, Leon Bridges), Gray was making music that felt right in touch with soul’s golden era, but that went its own way. “Ruby,” released this year, shows that she hasn’t changed her formula much; her raspy, mischievous singing and earnest songwriting still bear charms. She performs sets at 7 and 10 p.m.; the latter includes a three-course meal with open bar. At the Iridium, Manhattan; 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Russonello) DAVID GUETTA Guetta was one of the D.J.-producers who, over the past few years, helped to bring EDM into the global pop mainstream, even if it didn’t quite stay there. But underneath his big-tent anthems beats the heart of a classic house D.J. This will be his second straight year bringing in the new year in a Brooklyn warehouse. At 9 p.m., 63 Flushing Ave., Brooklyn; guettanye2019.com. (Caramanica) CARLOS HENRIQUEZ The bassist in the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Henriquez is increasingly showing up on Lincoln Center stages as a bandleader. A master of both classic jazz and Afro-Cuban styles, he released an album this year featuring ankle-breaking arrangements of Dizzy Gillespie tunes in a Latin-jazz mode. At Dizzy’s, Henriquez plays sets at 7:30 and 11 p.m., with a stellar nine-piece band including the trumpeter Terell Stafford, the tenor saxophonist Melissa Aldana and the drummer Obed Calvaire. Tickets include a three-course meal. At Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Manhattan; 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Russonello) Image Diet Cig will join Hop Along for a night of indie rock in Asbury Park, N.J.CreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York Times HOP ALONG AND DIET CIG This year, Hop Along released “Bark Your Head Off, Dog,” its best and most flexible album, full of curiously detailed stories delivered with piercing singing and dynamic indie-rock and folk-adjacent arrangements. The band’s opener at this show is another sharp woman-fronted group, the wry, potent and efficient pop-punk duo Diet Cig. At 9 p.m., Asbury Lanes, Asbury Park, N.J.; 732-361-6659, asburylanes.com. (Caramanica) HOUSE OF YES AND ZERO PRESENT NEW YEAR’S EVE Acid Pauli, known for his prolific, adventurous mixing of house and techno, leads an international roster of D.J.s that includes Behrouz, Mira, Be Svendsen and Oceanvs Orientalis. Guests can arrive at 9 p.m. and linger until 5 a.m. while enjoying other enticements such as a New Orleans jazz band, a body art and beauty parlor, a sound-healing lounge, fetish goddesses at the “Temple of Sacred Sin” and a midnight countdown with accompanying spectacle in each room (the most spectacular guaranteed in the Grand Ballroom). At Grand Prospect Hall, Brooklyn; houseofyes.org/NYE. (Gardner) THE LONE BELLOW AND COURTNEY MARIE ANDREWS The Lone Bellow is a three-member band from Brooklyn with roots from elsewhere: from Appalachian picking, the Band, 1960s soul, 1970s Nashville and Laurel Canyon. Its songs build from everyday events to impassioned close-harmony choruses. Courtney Marie Andrews has a striking voice, high and tremulous with reserves of power, that matches the fierce immediacy of songs that often come across as roots-rock hymns. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, Manhattan; 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com/boweryballroom. (Pareles) HAROLD MABERN This pianist was born in Memphis, in the cradle of midcentury soul music, but he’s been a New Yorker since the tail end of the 1950s, when bop still reigned. His experiences in both cities shine through in his richly harmonic playing and swiftly grooving music. Mabern has released four albums in the past four years on the Smoke Sessions label; at Smoke, the venue behind the label, he’ll be joined by the boisterous bop vocalist Mary Stallings, the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, the bassist John Webber and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. Tickets to either the 6:45 or 9:45 p.m. set include a four-course meal; the later option includes admission to a bonus late-night set. At Smoke, Manhattan; 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Russonello) Image House of Yes is helping to present a night of spectacles at the Grand Prospect Hall.CreditJoel Barhamand for The New York Times RICH MEDINA Since the 1990s, Medina has been a reliably knowledgeable party D.J., with a tool kit that spans house, soul, funk, hip-hop and beyond. At 10 p.m., C’mon Everybody, Brooklyn; cmoneverybody.com. (Caramanica) TONY MIDDLETON Since joining the doo-wop group the Willows as lead singer in the early 1950s, Middleton has wielded his textured baritone in Broadway musicals and European jazz clubs, and at the Apollo Theater, while collaborating with Burt Bacharach, Smokey Robinson, Cissy Houston and Della Reese. A frequent presence in various New York venues of late, he’ll welcome 2019 with his quartet, featuring the pianist Tadataka Unno, the saxophonist Eric Person, the bassist Jim Cammack and the drummer Dwayne Broadnax, with shows at 9 and 10:30 p.m., the latter including a champagne toast. At Zinc, Manhattan; 212-477-9462, zincjazz.com. (Gardner) MINGUS BIG BAND This band devoted to the repertoire of Charles Mingus captures the elements that made him so successful as a bassist and composer: his rangy power and the earnest, searching quality to his music. Assembled and managed by Mingus’s widow, Sue Mingus, this big band has held down a weekly residency at Jazz Standard for a decade now. It performs a couple of special New Year’s Eve shows at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., both of which include a three-course meal. At Jazz Standard, Manhattan; 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Russonello) MURPHY’S LAW The most pummeling New Year’s Eve lineup is headlined by the New York hardcore stalwarts Murphy’s Law, capping off a year in which the frontman Jimmy Gestapo suffered from serious health issues. Also performing: U.S. Bombs, Total Chaos, the Krays, Ice Cold Killers. At 7 p.m., the Kingsland, Brooklyn; 718-383-1900, kingslandbargrill.com. (Caramanica) THE NEW MASTERSOUNDS The New Mastersounds are British fans of vintage American soul and funk, a proudly retro-sounding instrumental band that devises hand-played grooves harking back to the 1960s and 1970s. For this band, wah-wah guitars, crisp backbeats and steamy electric organ never went out of style. At 8 p.m., Gramercy Theater, Manhattan; 212-614-6932, mercuryeastpresents.com/thegramercytheatre. (Pareles) ‘NEW YEAR’S EVE SPECTACULAR’ As close as you’d ever want to be to Times Square without having to stand in the cold for 12 hours, Carolines on Broadway is hosting an all-star stand-up showcase in its comfy, cozy basement club, plus you can still watch the ball drop onscreen. Performers include Yamaneika Saunders, seen on Netflix this fall as one of “The Degenerates,” Alex Edelman, named the Edinburgh Festival Fringe’s best newcomer, and others. The later show includes a D.J. and dancing after midnight. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Carolines on Broadway, Manhattan; 212-757-4100, carolines.com.

Yard has appeared on Comedy Central’s “Inside Amy Schumer,” and broke out as one of the main correspondents and panelists for that network’s “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore.” Yard also appeared this year on “The Break With Michelle Wolf” on Netflix. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Gotham Comedy Club, Manhattan; 212-367-9000, gothamcomedyclub.com. (McCarthy) NOTHING The Philadelphia band Nothing has been rebuilding shoegaze from within, replacing the dreamier components with a heft borrowed from hardcore and grunge while maintaining the genre’s fundamental elegiac nature. Also: more neo-shoegaze, but less rugged, from Weekend and Teen Body. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, Brooklyn; 347-529-6696, bk.knittingfactory.com. (Caramanica) JOHNNY O’NEAL This virtuoso pianist and endearing vocalist lives to thrill. He wants to bedazzle, but also to evoke a strong emotional response.

At Smalls, O’Neal will perform separate sets at 9:30 and 11 p.m., and just 50 tickets will be sold for each. They’ll be available only at the door, on a first-come, first-served basis.

His own groups lean toward funk, jazz and gospel-infused Southern rock. Burbridge’s latest Oteil & Friends lineup includes Melvin Seals, the longtime keyboardist for the Jerry Garcia Band; Eric Krasno, the guitarist from Soulive; John Kadlecik, a guitarist who was a founding member of the Dark Star Orchestra, and Jennifer Hartswick, a singer and trumpeter with the Trey Anastasio Band.

For its New Year’s Eve shows, the band sets out to top itself each year with a secret, ever more elaborate midnight stunt. Tickets for the arena itself have sold out, but Phish also offers webcast access in an array of resolutions and bundles. Full information is at webcast.livephish.com.

(Gardner) POST MALONE AND LIL PUMP End a dyspeptic 2018 with the sound of pop congealing into a slow, crawling moan. Post Malone is the most modern pop star — a rapper and singer, a child of hip-hop but not beholden to it, melancholy even when he’s celebrating. Opening this show will be Lil Pump, who represents everything Post Malone doesn’t: adrenaline, disruption, mayhem. At 9 p.m., Barclays Center, Brooklyn; 917-618-6100, barclayscenter.com. (Caramanica) CHRIS POTTER With a clear, almost vacuum-sealed tone, Potter plays the tenor saxophone with utter ease — and tenderness to match.

Admission is good for both sets, and includes hors d’oeuvres and party favors. At 9 and 11 p.m., the Village Vanguard, Manhattan; 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com.

The singer and songwriter Price is a country classicist, harking back to the twangy guitars, honky-tonk spirit and taut, telling wordplay of Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton; she comes up with choruses like “A little pain never hurt anyone.” Lily Hiatt went into the family business — the songwriter John Hiatt is her father — and she writes fervent, intimate roots-rockers about regrets, resilience and perseverance. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com. (Pareles) ‘QED’S NEW YEAR’S EVE SPECTACULAR’ Astoria’s top comedy club will not disappoint, with headlining entertainment provided by Christian Finnegan, Myq Kaplan and other comedians. Kaplan reached the finals of NBC’s “Last Comic Standing” in 2010, while Finnegan graduated from joking about the week’s headlines on VH1’s “Best Week Ever” to providing a little levity for viewers of MSNBC’s “Countdown With Keith Olbermann.” Admission includes an appetizer buffet. The later show includes noisemakers and a champagne toast at midnight, with live-streaming of the ball drop from Times Square. At 8 and 10 p.m., Q.E.D., Astoria, Queens; 347-451-3873, qedastoria.com.

(Gardner) THE RUB The Rub has been one of Brooklyn’s defining — and very fun — dance parties for a decade and a half, long enough that it recently released its own commemorative photobook, “Sixteen Years of the Rub.” Its New Year’s Eve event features DJ Ayres and DJ Eleven, the party’s resident D.J.s, and guest Nicole Sky (of Nina Sky).

In this moment, he’s perhaps more visible as a TV personality: charming host of the revamped “The Joker’s Wild,” and even more charming co-host of “Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party.” But don’t expect any of those versions of Snoop to come out at this concert, likely to be a hits revue of gangster-rap classics and saucy modern funk.

arts The Race to Woo Shohei Ohtani Is About to Begin - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|The Race to Woo Shohei Ohtani Is About to Begin Supported by The Race to Woo Shohei Ohtani Is About to Begin Image Shohei Ohtani after hitting a home run for the Japanese national team in 2016.CreditCreditMasterpress/Getty Images By Billy Witz Nov. 30, 2017 When the 30 Major League Baseball owners convene for a conference call Friday afternoon, they are expected to ratify a new agreement with the players’ union and Nippon Professional Baseball of Japan. It is a perfunctory move, but one that will allow Japanese players to continue to come to the major leagues. Shortly after that, the Nippon-Ham Fighters plan to put Shohei Ohtani up for bid, setting off what could be a recruiting frenzy that could last for several weeks. That is partly because, while money is typically the overriding factor when a player hits the open market — including ones from Japan — it is largely a moot point in the case of Ohtani, a 23-year-old hitting and pitching marvel. As such, many major league teams will feel free to make a pitch for Ohtani because under the current collective bargaining agreement, he will be exceedingly affordable — a $20 million fee to the Fighters, a bonus of no more than $3.55 million and a rookie contract at the major league minimum of $545,000 next season. Presumably, Ohtani will be interested in hearing from numerous teams about how they envision using him since his desire, and potential ability, to both pitch and hit on a regular basis sets him apart from his peers. Ohtani has 21 days to reach an agreement once he is put up for bid. To that end, his agent, Nez Balelo of Creative Arts Agency, sent a memo last week through the commissioner’s office to all 30 major league clubs. It had the feel of a business proposal. The memo asked for evaluations of Ohtani as a pitcher and hitter; explanations of a team’s player development, medical training and player-performance philosophies and facilities; details of the team’s resources to assist Ohtani’s cultural assimilation into the local area; a plan for integrating Ohtani into the organization; descriptions of a team’s major league, minor league and spring training facilities; reasons the team’s city would be a desirable place to play; and relevant marketplace characteristics. According to a baseball official who had seen the memo but was not authorized to speak about it, it also instructs teams not to guarantee anything to Ohtani — be it a commitment to his role on the team, finances or even space on the major league roster. That warning, the official said, coincides with the message that Commissioner Rob Manfred issued at last month’s general managers meeting, where he reiterated that teams not try to circumvent baseball’s rules on international signings with any off-the-books agreement with Ohtani. Manfred recently came down harshly on the Atlanta Braves for trying to make an end run around international signing rules. The main purpose of the memo appears to be to gather information ahead of the negotiation window so that Ohtani and his agents can quickly winnow the field to a more manageable number of suitors. Image Under far different circumstances from Ohtani, Masahiro Tanaka negotiated a huge deal with the Yankees after departing Japan.CreditAdam Glanzman/Getty Images While Ohtani is expected to meet with teams in the United States, it may not happen in one location, as was the case when the last high-profile Japanese player to come to the United States. Masahiro Tanaka decamped to Los Angeles before ultimately signing a seven-year, $155 million contract with the Yankees that went into effect for the 2014 season. Though C.A.A. has not determined its final plans, there is a possibility that Ohtani, as a matter of expedience, will meet with clubs at some point during baseball’s winter meetings in Orlando, Fla., from Dec. 10-14. But it is the money — or lack of it — that will make the bidding for Ohtani starkly different than it was for past Japanese stars. For years, major league teams would make blind bids to a player’s Japanese club for the right to an exclusive 30-day negotiating window. The last of those instances came when the Texas Rangers made a winning bid of $51 million to the Fighters in 2012 for the rights to negotiate with Yu Darvish in 2012. The Rangers then signed Darvish to a six-year, $60 million contract. The next year, a new agreement was reached that capped the posting fee at $20 million and allowed the player to negotiate with any major league team willing to pay that fee. Ohtani, however, will be signing under a far more restrictive scenario. That is because the latest collective bargaining agreement, signed last December, raised the age of foreign players subjected to the international bonus pool system from 23, with five seasons of professional baseball, to 25, with six seasons of pro ball. This meant Ohtani, who would have been free of international bonus-pool constraints under the old C.B.A., would have had to wait two more years before leaving Japan if he wanted a deal like the one Tanaka signed. But Ohtani was adamant about coming to the United States now, even if it is for far less money. He will also be subject to the normal rules governing free agency, which he will not reach for six seasons. Another factor in what Ohtani can make now is the hard cap on international player-bonus pools instituted in the new C.B.A. Under the old agreement, teams were assigned a number based on market size, but several teams blew past them since the penalty for doing so was modest. Now, teams can only spend their pool allowances, which currently range from $4.75 million to $5.75 million, though they can trade international pool money. The Texas Rangers have the most bonus money remaining, at $3.535 million, followed closely by the Yankees, who recently increased their total to $3.5 million by acquiring bonus-pool money from the Miami Marlins. Twelve teams — including the Los Angeles Dodgers — are capped at $300,000 for going over the bonus-pool limit in previous years, according to figures obtained by The Associated Press. Six teams have even less money remaining, including the Mets, who have $175,000. Still, bonus money may not be all that important to a player who chose not to wait two more years to cash in with a big contract and who also stands to make considerable money through endorsements. But exactly what is most important to Ohtani is what baseball is about to find out. Tyler Kepner contributed reporting.

arts Review: Met Opera’s ‘Adriana Lecouvreur’ Bristles With Passion and Danger - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Music|Review: Met Opera’s ‘Adriana Lecouvreur’ Bristles With Passion and Danger Supported by Critic’s Pick Review: Met Opera’s ‘Adriana Lecouvreur’ Bristles With Passion and Danger Image Piotr Beczala, left, as Maurizio and Anna Netrebko as the title character in Cilea’s “Adriana Lecouvreur” at the Met Opera.CreditCreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times Adriana Lecouvreur NYT Critic's Pick By Anthony Tommasini Jan. 1, 2019 Backstage at the Comédie-Française in the Paris of 1730, the title character of Francesco Cilea’s “Adriana Lecouvreur,” a leading actress with the company, demurs when hailed by a prince and an abbé as a muse, a goddess, a siren. No, Adriana answers in the short, soaring aria “Io son l’umile ancella.” She is a humble maidservant of the creative spirit who provides the words, the delicate instrument that serves the creator’s hand. Actually, Cilea created this 1902 opera as a surefire vehicle for a prima donna, so it’s always hard to take Adriana’s words seriously when a soprano sings them. But on Monday at the Metropolitan Opera’s New Year’s Eve gala premiere of a new production of “Adriana,” Anna Netrebko turned this aria into the aching expression of a woman who triumphs on the stage but muddles through life. Adriana Lecouvreur: Fedra’s MonologueCreditCreditVideo by Metropolitan Opera Image Ms. Netrebko, center, with other members of the excellent cast in David McVicar’s production.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times When we meet her she is hopelessly in love with a dashing young man, Maurizio, whom she believes to be an ensign to a count. (He actually is the Count of Saxony.) But even before we see the lovers together, Ms. Netrebko, for all the charisma and allure she conveyed with her glamorous presence and her plush, intensely beautiful singing, suggested how uncertain Adriana feels. Emphasizing three crucial words, she sang that her life is quiet, happy and terrible. Terrible? Yes, in a way. You believed that this artist, who constantly recreates herself in public, would in life be all too vulnerable to the jealousies of rivals, the fawning of admirers, and the passions of a hotheaded, prevaricating young man. Also, the truth is that for all the lyrical richness, melodramatic fervor and stylish evocations of Parisian courtly and theatrical life in 1730, this opera, the only one by Cilea that turns up now and then in production, needs all the help it can get from artists of Ms. Netrebko’s stature. It’s a good and effective, but not great, work. The light touch that Cilea brings to bear, while preventing the drama from slipping into mawkish excess, sometimes feels musically thin. “Adriana” must have a superior cast and conductor to succeed. The Met is providing that and more with this David McVicar staging, which replaces the musty 1963 production created for Renata Tebaldi. The tenor Piotr Beczala, singing with youthful fervor, ardent lyricism and clarion top notes, is ideal as the impetuous Maurizio. While suggesting how smitten he is by Adriana, he comes across as a young man on the move. With his royal position looking risky, he proves himself through military exploits. But we learn that he is also disentangling himself from an advantageous liaison with the married Princess of Bouillon, who refuses to let him go. As the princess, the mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili, who almost stole the show singing Amneris to Ms. Netrebko’s Aida this fall, was again stupendous. She sang with unforced power and rich colorings throughout the wide range of her voice, from chesty low tones to gleaming top notes. Yet in conveying this imposing princess’s inner emotional fragility, Ms. Rachvelishvili shaped crucial phrases with supple, yearning tenderness. For all the convoluted strands of this story, “Adriana” is at its core a torturous love triangle. Ms. Netrebko, Mr. Beczala and Ms. Rachvelishvili claimed those roles so tenaciously that the drama bristled with passion and danger. Image Ms. Netrebko, left, with the mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili, whose Princess of Bouillon is part of a torturous love triangle with Adriana and Maurizio.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times [Read more about Anita Rachvelishvili’s rocket to stardom] That these performances made “Adriana” seem more musically substantial than usual was also thanks to the insightful conducting of Gianandrea Noseda. Cilea emerged during a period in Italian opera, dominated by Puccini, when the public could not get enough of hot-blooded, verismo (essentially true to life) music dramas. When it comes to harmonic daring and subtle manipulations of melodic motifs, Cilea was no Puccini. But without pumping up or milking the music in any way, Mr. Noseda led a vigorous, exacting and pulsing performance, drawing out inner details and lending lightness, with a mordant touch, to the many scenes of backstage bustle and frivolity at the company where Adriana is a star. The opera inhabits a realm similar to the 1980s play, and later film, “Dangerous Liaisons,” which shows 18th-century courtly French life as a game of sexual adventure and humiliation. In this Met production (involving five other companies and introduced at Covent Garden in London in 2010), Mr. McVicar puts the focus on the backstage hubbub of the theater troupe as much as possible. A rotating replica of a Baroque theater (a dominant element of Charles Edwards’s set) reveals the actors and dancers readying themselves in cluttered dressing rooms, then spins around to show us the performance as viewed from the wings. The costumes (by Brigitte Reiffenstuel) are also true to the styles of the period. In these days when updated settings are commonplace, Mr. McVicar’s choice to maintain the original setting might seem safe. But by telling the story with such attention to period detail he emphasized the opera’s intertwining of political and sexual intrigue. The entire cast was excellent, especially the baritone Ambrogio Maestri as Michonnet, the stage manager of the company, who pines for Adriana. With his formidable voice and hulking physique, Mr. Maestri was in his element bellowing commands at his troupe, which made the moments when he is awkward with affection for Adriana almost heartbreaking. Other standouts were Maurizio Muraro as the Prince of Bouillon, who hardly cares about his wife’s infidelities and is carrying on his own affair with Adriana’s rival in the theater company, and Carlo Bosi as the wily Abbé of Chazeuil. The strongest scenes in the opera, involving the three principals, leapt off the stage on Monday, especially the confrontation between Adriana and the princess in Act II, when they discover that they both love Maurizio. Ms. Netrebko and Ms. Rachvelishvili sang ferociously as they hurled accusatory phrases at each other. Yet each found moments in the music to suggest the womanly longing that consumes them. Since the spring of 2018, Ms. Netrebko is three for three in bringing new roles to the Met and making them her own: Puccini’s Tosca, Verdi’s Aida, and now Adriana Lecouvreur. In the final scene, when Adriana sings the aria “Poveri fiori,” Ms. Netrebko was magnificent. She cradles dying violets, a token of love she had given Maurizio, which she mistakenly thinks he has returned as a sign of rejection. In fact the princess has sent them, laced with poison. The implausible elements of the situation disappeared as Ms. Netrebko made this music, and this moment, seem an inspired creation.

arts In ‘The Earth Dies Streaming,’ Film Criticism That Transcends Raves and Pans - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|In ‘The Earth Dies Streaming,’ Film Criticism That Transcends Raves and Pans Supported by Books of The Times In ‘The Earth Dies Streaming,’ Film Criticism That Transcends Raves and Pans By Jennifer Szalai Dec. 26, 2018 Image CreditCreditSonny Figueora/The New York Times It can be hard for criticism to cohere when it’s perforated by ambivalence. A rave coasts along, buoyed by enthusiasm. A pan serves up the dramatic tension on a platter: The people trying to sell you a book (or movie or play) insist that it’s great, and here’s why it’s unremittingly awful. Mixed feelings are trickier, and more vulnerable. They’re like unstable elements waiting to be pulled into a wishy-washy middle ground. Reading “The Earth Dies Streaming,” a collection of film writing by A. S. Hamrah, you realize it doesn’t have to be this way. As the resident movie critic of the journal n+1, Hamrah is committed to his ambivalence, conveying it with a mixture of precision and conviction that will remind you how much more there is to be gleaned from a review than whether a movie is “good” or “bad” (even if it’s a movie you happen to deem very good or very bad indeed). When he first started reviewing films, Hamrah was bothered by how easily his sentences could get sucked into the maw of the entertainment industry, and so he resolved “to never include anything in my writing that could be extracted and used for publicity.” Nothing that might become a blurb, that is, if he could help it. He decided to make his negative opinions unusable too, resistant to algorithm-driven cultural curation. “Write so that Rotten Tomatoes cannot apprehend your work,” he suggests, “which will allow its meaning to be deformed to the point where studios will not know what to do with it.” This is perverse. It is also delightful. A review that begins with “Whit Stillman’s movies are like porn films with the sex scenes cut out” will entice a curious human and confound an aggregation machine. Hamrah’s tenure at n+1 began in 2008, with an Oscars roundup that he literally phoned in because his day job kept him too busy. (For money and health insurance, he uses “semiotics to analyze television programming for a brand consultancy” — a postmodern occupation if there ever was one.) The riffs he dictated to his editor were terse and funny, with judgment slyly imparted through insinuation and association. He had this to say about “Atonement,” an adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel: “Everything McEwan writes ends up as a movie. Someday his shopping lists will be filmed.” As clever as such lines are, they were recorded in another era. If you read “The Earth Dies Streaming” from beginning to end, and I suggest you do, you won’t get to that 2008 Oscars roundup until you’re almost finished with the book, which mostly proceeds in reverse chronological order. The first review meets us where we are right now, in Trump’s America. Hamrah describes “A Quiet Place,” a post-apocalyptic fantasy in which a nation of whiners is forced by noise-seeking monsters to stay silent, as “a horror movie for MAGA-ites.” Image A. S. HamrahCreditLesley Unruh A political awareness imbues Hamrah’s criticism without weighing it down. He doesn’t succumb to a leaden moralizing because he pays close attention to the medium he’s writing about, alert to what he sees and hears. Gérard Depardieu in 2017 is “still half man, half wildebeest.” Anthony Hopkins, playing Alfred Hitchcock, is remembered for his prosthetic lips and his noisy slurping. Steven Spielberg shows up periodically in these pages as a stand-in for a certain kind of Hollywood vision: so unquestionably talented and so exquisitely banal that even his vaunted liberalism can’t prevent him from churning out movies that often end up being fundamentally conservative, full of empty grandeur. Spielberg says how much he admires elders like Stanley Kubrick but then unwittingly botches the homage, using classic footage of Kubrick’s “The Shining” in “Ready Player One” only to deface it with what Hamrah calls “Scooby-Doo action.” On the movies he likes, Hamrah is idiosyncratic, sometimes apparently surprised by his own surprise. “Flight,” starring Denzel Washington as a heroic pilot with an alcohol problem, “is so good, except for the syrupy last 10 minutes, that it is hard to believe Robert Zemeckis, who directed it, has spent the last 25 or so years since he made ‘Back to the Future’ directing the things he’s directed.” The quietly unnerving “First Reformed” prompts Hamrah to decide “it is time to admit that Ethan Hawke is the great survivor of his generation of male leads,” even if he “may play too nice sometimes.” Every critic has a bugbear, and whenever you see the word “nice” in one of Hamrah’s reviews, you know he believes that something has gone awry — or maybe not awry enough. Nice is too comfortable and comforting to be trusted. It’s a gentrifying force, replacing whatever is “twisted and ugly” and singularly weird with an attractive sheen that might seem safer but ultimately isn’t. Like the painter and critic Manny Farber, the subject of an incisive and moving essay in this volume, Hamrah is suspicious of anything that dulls the senses, lulling audiences into a false sense of security and therefore complacency. Part of his vigilance extends to being attuned to the circumstances under which he watches movies. He contrasts the experience of sitting next to other critics at a press screening to watching a blurry bootleg video of “The Spiderwick Chronicles” in the crowded waiting room of a walk-in health clinic in Brooklyn. “As I sat there,” he writes, “in pain myself and barely able to focus, I realized that this was the future of moviegoing.” Hollywood tries to be a dream factory, but real life inevitably intrudes. Hamrah misses a festival screening because of a therapy appointment. He slips in a conversation with his aunt, whose friend “sees a lot of movies for free” because “he knows people” through his job as a prison guard. Hamrah gets mistaken for Orson Welles, even though Hamrah doesn’t wear a hat or a cape and, unlike Welles, is very much alive. Now that online streaming has made for a glut of unwanted DVDs, entire cinematic eras are being offered on the cheap. “I will never forget the time I saw a man in a parking lot scraping the snow off the windshield of his car with the DVD of ‘Independence Day’ he had just bought,” Hamrah writes. The image is so real and so vivid and so reflective of where we are now that my first thought was, “That ought to be in a movie.” Follow Jennifer Szalai on Twitter: @jenszalai.

She won the first Leopard for Jewelry in Fashion.CreditCreditDarren Gerrish By Rachel Garrahan Dec. 1, 2017 LONDON — There is an abundance of award ceremonies this time of year. Few industries miss an opportunity to fete themselves and their biggest stars with a glamorous, hopefully headline-grabbing night out. The organizers of the first Leopards Awards for Excellence in Jewelry, held Nov. 15, looked to stars outside the industry to raise jewelry’s profile among a wider audience. The organizers were Carol Woolton, a writer and jewelry editor of British Vogue; Susan Farmer, a jewelry consultant; and the jewelers Solange Azagury-Partridge, Shaun Leane, Stephen Webster and Theo Fennell. Calling themselves the London Leopards, a reference to the hallmark that has been used for centuries to mark gold and silver pieces weighed in the city, they said that jewelry deserves more attention than it sometimes receives. “We feel jewelry is very important culturally, and very important to London,” said Ms. Woolton, who added that the capital continues to be a valuable destination in terms of jewelry design, craftsmanship and sales. Ms. Azagury-Partridge noted a lack of news coverage about the industry and said, “It’s time to put it on the map and in people’s consciousnesses.” The organizers chose the winners, and the awards — small leopard statues that were designed by Ms. Azagury-Partridge — were presented at a dinner in the gilded, candle-chandelier-lit Goldsmiths’ Hall, the center of British jewelry for almost 700 years. Image David Furnish collected the Leopard Legend award for his husband, Elton John, who was on tour.CreditDavid M. Benett The fashion designer Gareth Pugh presented Daphne Guinness, the muse and musician known for her distinctive style and close collaboration with designers including Alexander McQueen, with the award for Jewelry in Fashion. The Netflix series “The Crown” was awarded a Leopard for Jewelry on Screen and the Victoria & Albert Museum was recognized for its contribution to Jewelry in the Arts. Elton John was named Leopard Legend, his award collected by his husband, David Furnish, who joked that Mr. John could not be there because he was on tour in order “to buy more jewelry.” One award category was conspicuously absent. There was no Leopard for best jewelry designer or brand. “We didn’t want to pitch one jeweler against another,” Ms. Woolton said. “We didn’t want the awards to be generically industry. We wanted them to appeal to a very broad group of people and to provoke everyone to think about the importance of jewelry in their lives, in art, in film.” The event, held in aid of the Prince’s Trust charitable organization, will also help support a mentorship program for jewelry designers under 30. The Leopards selected the winners: Louis Browning, Katherine Anderson, Mollie Rose Hemming and Hannah Jackson. The winners’ entries will be produced with the Leopards’ guidance and sold at their stores, with proceeds donated to the Prince’s Trust. Ms. Azagury-Partridge said she hoped the event and the mentorship program would help inspire a new generation of designers and jewelry makers. “It’s a dying art and we hope more young people will want to be a part of it,” she said.

And that was only the tip of the iceberg for Ms. Gardner, who also had several one-acts on the boards last year, including “Ballgirl” at the Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival and a pair of pieces as part of Ensemble Studio Theater’s Youngblood program. Tellingly, Ms. Gardner is presenting another brief effort, “Cowboy,” in the Exponential Festival, which gathers experimental works by New York writers. [Other festivals in January: Read about an adaptation of Sarah Kane’s “4:48 Psychosis” at Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now and Under the Radar at the Public Theater.] “I put up weird little stuff all the time, I’m not super-precious about it,” Ms. Gardner, 27, said by phone from Los Angeles. “I just love having a single visual image onstage. Sometimes I see people expanding a one-act and usually I feel, ‘That thing is really a short piece.’” “Cowboy,” which is part of a triple bill at Target Margin’s Doxsee Theater, Jan. 17-20, is a monologue by the titular character, who happens to be the last cowboy in the world — and is played by a different actor at each performance, including Brittain Ashford, Becca Blackwell and Dasha Nekrasova. The trick is that the show’s running time varies between six and 20 minutes. “It could depend on whatever the audience is feeling and responding to,” said the director, Charles Quittner, 26. “How we do the performance is pretty randomized in that things are triggered out of certain events that might happen during the show. “The form of this actually reminds me of a Wild West show from the 19th century because this cowboy might end up doing stunts onstage,” he added. “We’re having fun with futility.” Ms. Gardner said, “It’s sort of, God willing, this play will work. It makes me a little nervous but I think it’ll be fun,” she said. “There’s an element that’s out of everyone’s control.” The young writer herself appears fully in control of her career, which has been on an upward swing since she won the 2017 Relentless Award for her play “P____ Sludge.” She is currently working on full-length shows for the Atlantic Theater, Manhattan Theater Club and Clubbed Thumb. In the fall she moved to California, where she is developing a project with the “Spotlight” movie director Tom McCarthy for Paramount TV. Not bad for someone who skipped the fancy M.F.A. programs her peers favor and was juggling odd jobs until recently, including working for the TV show “Mr. Robot.” “Being a production assistant is grueling, but I was very lucky that for a while I worked on a show that was shot at night,” Ms. Gardner said. “There would be nobody in the office except for me and another woman so I was able to get a lot of writing done overnight. I also worked at a bar in NoLIta that was very slow. It was not great for tips — there were three regulars drinking spritzes — but it did mean I got a lot of writing done on my phone during shifts.” ONE MORE EXPONENTIAL SHOW The double bill of David Perez’s “1993” and Justin Linville’s “#1 Dad,” Jan. 17 and Jan. 20 at the Brick, illustrates the melding of theater and comedy flourishing on the young New York scene. The Exponential Festival is at various Brooklyn venues from Friday through Feb. 3; 917-520-5912; theexponentialfestival.org.

John Grisham’s “The Reckoning” remains atop the fiction list, and Michelle Obama’s “Becoming” still holds the No. 1 nonfiction spot. But it is something of a surprise to see Obama’s memoir, which has been translated into 23 languages, selling so well the world over. In Finland, for example, the former first lady’s book has been at No. 1 on the bookseller Akateeminen Kirjakauppa’s nonfiction list for weeks, followed closely by “Paranoid Optimist,” a memoir from the Nokia chairman Risto Siilasmaa (clearly that title works better in Finnish than it does translated into English). Next door in Sweden at Svensk Bokhandel, “Becoming” is at No. 2, edged out by Hans Rosling’s “Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the World — and Why Things Are Better Than You Think,” which was one of Barack Obama’s favorite books last year. Sweden is a Scandinavian outlier, though; “Becoming” is No. 1 in both Norway and Denmark. It tops the lists in other European countries, too, including Germany, Portugal and England. [ In this essay, Isabel Wilkerson brings all her narrative firepower to Michelle Obama’s “Becoming.” ] “Becoming” is No. 3 on Ireland’s combined list, where it follows “Normal People,” a novel by the hugely popular Irish writer Sally Rooney, and “At All Costs,” a memoir from the hurling manager and player Davy Fitzgerald. It is No. 4 in both France and Spain; in Italy, where most of the books on the combined top 10 list are by Italian authors (Elena Ferrante commands the four top spots), “Becoming” is No. 9. It’s No. 14 in Poland and No. 20 in the Czech Republic, and it seems to be selling briskly at bookstores in Albania. In fact, the only European country where Obama’s book sales seem weak is Greece, where the No. 1 book is Xenakis Stefanos’s “The Present” — “Every day is a Gift. Open it. Do not throw it away.” “Becoming” doesn’t appear on Greek nonfiction lists at all. Obama’s memoir is selling well elsewhere in the world, too, including Japan, Australia, Israel and South Africa. It’s No. 1 in Singapore and No. 4 in South Korea. It’s a hit in South America, though in Brazil its sales trail those of “Lessons,” a memoir by the Brazilian-born supermodel Gisele Bündchen. But “Becoming” doesn’t seem to have caught on in Peru, where it doesn’t make the lists — like one from bookstore Planeta de Libros — at all. The No. 1 nonfiction title there is Jessica Vega Puch’s “Yoga or Clonazepam?

Bliss Collection Cézanne Portraits NYT Critic's Pick By Holland Cotter June 20, 2018 WASHINGTON — There’s an engrossing confab of a show in session at the National Gallery of Art here. It’s called “Cézanne Portraits.” With some 60 likenesses by a notoriously testy, people-averse artist, it’s the largest gathering of its kind in a century. (The last one was in Paris in 1910.) And it has just a few more weeks to run, so if you’re going to catch the conversation, which I seriously recommend, the time is now. Image Paul Cézanne, “The Artist’s Father, Reading L’Événement,” 1866. The artist’s Provençal father, Louis-Auguste Cézanne, has his head in a newspaper, as if trying to tune everyone out.CreditNational Gallery of Art, Washington You’ll know most of the players by type, if not by name. Cézanne himself, in self-portraits, is very present, looking alternately feral and professorial. So is his mate of nearly 40 years, Hortense Fiquet, who sits with her hands knotted in her lap and a lifetime of patience inscribed on her face. The Cézanne clan, as a whole, is a tense bunch. The artist’s Provençal father, Louis-Auguste Cézanne, has his head in a newspaper, as if trying to tune everyone out. By contrast, his uncle, Dominique Aubert, can’t stay still. In a series of 10 portraits done in a two-year span he mugs as if he were in a bus station photo booth. Image Paul Cézanne, “Self-Portrait with Bowler Hat,” 1885.CreditCarlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen A few art celebrities are on hand. Émile Zola, Cézanne’s childhood friend in Aix-en-Provence and (at least early on) aesthetic brother in arms, reclines on a cushion, a Buddha in beige gabardine. The art critic Gustave Geffroy, who Cézanne loved (when Geffroy wrote something nice about him), then loathed (for reasons we don’t know), hunkers spiderlike over a scattering of open books. And the dealer Ambroise Vollard, who put Cézanne’s career on the map (he organized his first portrait show), is rewarded, if that’s the word, with the likeness seen here. Vollard claimed to have submitted to 115 sittings for the painting, each lasting from 8 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., during which time he was verbally slapped — “You wretch! You’ve spoiled the pose! Do I have to tell you again you must sit like an apple?” — if he so much as twitched. The torment he suffered doesn’t come through in the image itself, in which Vollard projects the calm of a seasoned statesman. Yet Cézanne, after all the hassle, decided the picture was a failure and refused to finish it. One day he put down his brushes and never came back. Image Cézanne’s portrait, “Ambroise Vollard,” 1899, depicts the art dealer as a seasoned statesman. Vollard submitted to 115 sittings and was verbally slapped by the painter — “You wretch! You’ve spoiled the pose!” — if he so much as twitched.CreditRMN-Grand Palais/Agence Bulloz He could get away with such behavior because he wasn’t working on commission, never did. He picked the people he wanted to paint, almost always family or friends. And they sat — and sat — because they felt obliged or flattered. This arrangement also meant he could do portraits that are, stylistically, as much about the painter as the sitter. There’s a theory that Cézanne viewed his human subjects the same way he did the apples and mountains in his other work: as mere abstract shapes, excuses for testing the mechanics of depiction. And it’s certainly true that he saw himself as an experimenter, an anti-academic art dissident. His beginnings set him up as an outsider to the Parisian establishment. He was born in rural Aix in 1839, the son of a bourgeois banker turned gentleman farmer. Faced with paternal disapproval — his father wanted him to be a lawyer — he went countercultural: in an early self-portrait owned by the Musée D’Orsay in Paris, where the show originated, he depicts himself as hirsute Wookiee. He also made a point of being a rude, crude technician. In his pictures of Uncle Dominique, he slathers on paint with a palette knife, like pâté on bread. Nor did he make any effort, at least until late in his career, to idealize his sitters. His many portraits of his wife suggest the very opposite was true. Image In “Uncle Dominique,” circa 1866, Cézanne slathers on paint with a palette knife, like pâté on bread.CreditMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston The two began living together in 1869, when Cézanne was 30 and Fiquet was 19; in 1872, they had a son, their only child. After hiding the relationship for years from the artist’s family, they finally married in 1886, though rarely lived together thereafter. One of the show’s earliest portraits of Fiquet, from around 1877, is really a portrait of the dress she wears, a mountain of shimmery blue-green stripes. At the top of this fabric Alp is a perfectly oval head, with a chalky, hollow-eyed mask of a face and a pulled-back, wig-like hairdo. Image Paul Cézanne, “Madame Cézanne in a Striped Dress,” 1890-1892.CreditPhiladelphia Museum of Art This portrait set a template for many others of Fiquet that would follow over time. (Almost 30 are known; 15 are in the show.) The consistent features include the egg-shaped head; the cap-like hair; the emphasis on details of clothing; and an unreadable expressive content. Unreadable does not mean unread: For a century, art historians have interpreted these paintings either as evidence of Fiquet’s discontentment with her lot in the marriage (how many days did she clock up as sitter?), and of Cézanne’s cold, everything-for-art objectification of her as a pileup of ovals and cones. Image The consistent features of his portraits of his wife, which include the egg-shaped head, the cap-like hair and an unreadable expressive content, are evident in “Madame Cézanne in a Red Dress,” 1888.CreditThe Metropolitan Museum of Art The psychodynamic accuracy of all this we’ll never know. And anyway, that’s not the full story, or maybe even the central one. When I look at Cézanne’s work in other genres — the apples in his still lifes, the mountains in his landscapes — I see geometry, but also warmth. When I look at the portraits I see this too: crankiness, yes, but also teasing jokes, affectionate digs, and love. In paintings of Uncle Dominique, he comes across as a family clown, the kind that kids delight in. Cézanne père was a crusty conservative — “cold, stingy,” Zola called him — but his son’s portrait is the equivalent of a tickle: It sends the old man into art history reading a newspaper for which Zola wrote. In image after image, Fiquet looks stiff, even robotic. Then suddenly in one from the mid-1880s — around the year the couple married — she doesn’t. Her hair streams loose, her lips are slightly parted, and her face, bent toward us, is awash with emotion. And this sight sends us back to her other portraits, to reassess and imagine what we’ve missed. Unabashed tenderness softens the portraits of Aix farmers and domestic workers Cézanne painted in the decade before his death, at 67, in 1906. By then the family estate was his; the artist-rebel had become a devout Roman Catholic and vehement Provençal nativist, scornful of Paris, though glad for its approval. His late portraits had one primary emotional focus: on the unmodern, precious but endangered rural world that the artist grew up in and never really left. Image Cézanne’s “The Gardener Vallier,” 1906. His later portraits focused on the unmodern, precious but endangered rural world that the artist grew up in.CreditNational Gallery of Art, Washington It too is represented in the Washington exhibition — organized by John Elderfield, chief curator emeritus of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, with Mary Morton of the National Gallery of Art, and Xavier Rey, former director of collections at the Musée d’Orsay — in the person of a man named Vallier, who was Cézanne’s gardener. From his curved back and beard we take him to be elderly. He’s sitting in darkness, so he could be anywhere: in Provence, Paris, indoors, outdoors. And he’s seen in profile, so we don’t have the complication of trying to scrutinize his face, interpret his mood. In a talkative show of contrary voices, he’s a quiet zone. Half-abstract, picked out in light, he looks like a spill of late-summer leaves, drifting downward, becoming earth.

arts Picture Books That Celebrate a Grandparent’s Selfless Love - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Picture Books That Celebrate a Grandparent’s Selfless Love Supported by Children’s Books Picture Books That Celebrate a Grandparent’s Selfless Love Image From “A Gift From Abuela.” By Benjamin Anastas Dec. 7, 2018 My Nana never explained to us why she’d chosen to go by a more culturally neutral shorthand for “grandmother” instead of the customary — and irresistible — Greek word “Yiayia.” She was a proud Greek-American who worked as a receptionist until she was 84, listened to Nana Mouskouri records on the hi-fi in her living room, and rolled dolmades so perfectly uniform they belonged in an encyclopedia of domestic miracles. “Chryso mou,” she used to say out loud when she took my sister’s face in her hands, then my older brother’s, and then mine; we were all her “golden one” (“dear one” is the less literal translation), but the fierceness and unselfishness of my Nana’s love made each of us feel as if we’d been singled out. The Brooklyn-based illustrator and graphic designer Cecilia Ruiz captures the particular tenderness of grandmothers in A GIFT FROM ABUELA (Candlewick, 29 pp., $15.99; ages 4 to 8), her first book written expressly for young children. Ruiz’s “The Book of Memory Gaps” (2015) and “The Book of Extraordinary Deaths” (2018) are dazzlingly Goreyesque in their cataloging of suggestive memory disorders and evocative deaths from the seventh century B.C. to the present. “A Gift From Abuela,” with its block-printed illustrations in muted colors, is more modest in its storytelling and heartwarming in its message, though Ruiz still manages to capture complex social realities (the economic crisis in Mexico in the early 1990s, the alienation of older adults). The story itself is simple: Abuela saves her hard-earned pesos to buy a special present for her beloved granddaughter Niña, though when the government devalues the peso and she fails to exchange it, the money becomes worthless. To lift Abuela’s spirits, Niña’s solution is to cut the old bills into pieces for elaborate papel picado banners and use them to decorate the drab apartment, allowing Ruiz to create an art-project-within-a-picture-book story that had my own 2-year-old transfixed. An abuela’s love is valued and returned in new and innovative forms. At the book’s end, Niña and Abuela are spending a Sunday in the park, having pan dulce and watching the people go by: “It was still their favorite thing to do,” Ruiz writes. Image From “Thank You, Omu!”CreditTBD The grandmother figure in Oge Mora’s debut as an author-illustrator, THANK YOU, OMU! (Little, Brown, 31 pp., $18.99; ages 4 to 8), is a life-giving force with a nearly bottomless stew pot. The story opens in a kitchen at “the corner of First Street and Long Street, on the very top floor” (the city is unnamed), where Omu, dressed in a yellow drape and gold drop earrings, is tasting the delicious stew that she plans on eating that night. Mora’s illustrations use collage to give the book’s world a sense of depth and vibrancy — the stew in the pot is represented by an ever-changing calico design — and the stream of cooking odors trailing out the apartment window gives the first hint of the book’s folkloric plot. An author’s note informs us that in the Nigerian language Igbo, “omu” means “queen,” and that in Mora’s family, the word also meant “Grandma.” As Omu’s cooking pot simmers on the stove, the delicious smell travels, and soon a succession of people are knocking at the door to get a taste: a boy from down the hall; a female police officer; a hot dog vendor; a cabdriver. Omu, thanks to the deliciousness of her stew, becomes a grandmother to the whole community. When her pot finally runs empty and it looks as if Omu won’t have anything to eat that night, the community returns the love by feeding Omu with an impromptu potluck dinner. Mora is especially deft at using pastels and china markers to give the faces of her cutout figures roundness and expression; similarly, the street scenes are filled with cutouts (a lurching taxi, a flying bus, an energetic-looking soccer player) that will have toddlers reaching out to grab them. Image From “Grandmother’s Visit.”CreditTBD The writer Betty Quan and the artist Carmen Mok strike a more somber note in GRANDMOTHER’S VISIT (Groundwood, 29 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), their collaboration about the persistence of grandmothers — and the sense of absence that follows their loss. Told in the first-person, the book follows an unnamed girl through her days with her Chinese-born grandmother (it’s never stated outright, but the girl’s grandmother is her primary caregiver while her parents are off at work), learning how to get the proportions right when cooking a pot of rice, or listening to her stories about eating red lotus beans on holidays back in her village. Suddenly the girl’s grandmother is no longer at her side after school, and the door to her bedroom is always closed. Her death is handled suggestively, and the book’s color palette darkens as the story takes a beguiling turn in its last pages and veers into the territory of a traditional Chinese ghost story. Small children shouldn’t be frightened, though — the spirit of this grandmother is much too loving and protective for that. Lest we forget about grandfathers and their unearthly powers, the beloved children’s author Tomie dePaola, best known for the classic witchy grandmother story “Strega Nona” (1975), has created the beautifully spare picture book QUIET (Simon & Schuster, 28 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8). This meditation on seeing and stillness teaches mindfulness to children — and the adults who read to them — in a nonpreachy way. Everything about the book is pared-down essentials, from the one-word title to the sparing use of text to the colorfully elemental illustrations. Image From “Quiet.” The book opens with a grandfather, looking very much the artist in a banded hat and long scarf, standing in a green field with his two grandchildren and a dog, watching the bees swarm a patch of flowers. A praying mantis climbs a lily stalk, and a mother fox lies curled with her young in a hidden den. “My, oh my,” the grandfather says. “Everything is in such a hurry.” The family moves through the landscape in the pages that follow, finally sitting down on a bench in order to notice, see deeper and describe. “The birds are just like us,” the grandfather says at one point. “Taking a rest, singing their song.” In its slowness and its serenity, “Quiet” is a prime example of the “late style” in dePaola’s trajectory (think Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” or Verdi’s “Falstaff”) and a corrective to the distraction that threatens to engulf us all. Leave it to a grandparent with an uncanny gift of sight to remind us how to stop, look and really see. But quietly.

arts Kevin Hart and the Academy: 2018 Gets the Messy Oscars It Deserves - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Arts Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Arts|Kevin Hart and the Academy: 2018 Gets the Messy Oscars It Deserves Supported by The Carpetbagger Kevin Hart and the Academy: 2018 Gets the Messy Oscars It Deserves Image Kevin Hart was announced as host on Tuesday; he was gone by the end of the week, a swift takeback that echoed the academy’s announcement and rescinding of a new Oscar for popular movie.CreditCreditChristopher Polk/Getty Images By Kyle Buchanan Dec. 7, 2018 Last week I noted that the Oscars provide a telling lens through which we can examine the year in pop culture at large. Whether that relevance is expressed through the actual nominations or via the tough conversations about what is canonized and what isn’t, this awards show never fails to provide insight into where we are as a culture. With that in mind, there is at least one clear message that we can divine from the past year in all things Oscar: 2018 has been an absolute mess. The academy’s woes didn’t start this week when Kevin Hart was hired to host the Oscars and then dropped out two days later after he refused to apologize for anti-gay jokes. In fact, ever since John Bailey was elected president of the academy in 2017, the Oscars have flung themselves headlong into one controversy after another, many of which were of their own making. First, there was an incredibly wan ceremony in March, hosted by a disengaged Jimmy Kimmel. It was a significant anniversary for the Oscars — the academy’s 90th show — yet the telecast had no special pomp and circumstance nor even much verve. Aside from the winners, I’m hard-pressed to recall a single significant moment from the telecast, except for the indelible image of Armie Hammer wielding a hot-dog cannon. It was the lowest-rated Oscars ever, and it felt like that as you watched it. Then, shortly after the ceremony, a sexual-harassment claim was filed against Bailey. The allegation of misconduct came not even eight months into Bailey’s tenure as president of the academy, and just over two months after widely reported industry abuses led Hollywood women to create Time’s Up. Image John Bailey at an academy reception in March. His tenure as president of the organization has been marked by missteps.CreditDavid McNew/Reuters Bailey, a cinematographer, denied the claim, which was said to involve an allegation of inappropriate touching on a movie set nearly 10 years ago, and the academy issued a determination that the accusation had no merit. Still, the industry furrowed its collective brow, and it remains an open question how Hollywood will continue to deal with powerful men accused of wrongdoing. (As Bailey spoke at the microphone during a recent award-season event, an Oscar winner leaned over to me and snarked, “Didn’t he get #MeToo’d?”) This summer, the academy further rankled Hollywood with its hasty announcement of a new Oscar meant to reward popular films. Executives at ABC, the network that broadcasts the ceremony, had pressured the academy to make changes to ensure that bigger blockbusters would find purchase on the telecast; still, the Oscars are ostensibly merit-based, and the idea of an award tied to box office sparked a backlash. It also indicated that academy higher-ups may have been out of touch with the Oscar race: One of the most popular films of all time, Marvel’s superhero story “Black Panther,” is on a path to score multiple Oscar nominations, and though Bradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” had yet to open, industry scuttlebutt over the summer earmarked it as a potential best picture front-runner with the makings of a major hit. If every producer and publicist in town knew these things, why didn’t the academy? Weeks after the idea of a popular-film Oscar had been announced, the notion was rescinded. At least that hurried takeback prepared the academy for what was to come after the selection of Kevin Hart as Oscar host. Even that pick was made awfully late in the game. The academy did not hire producers for the February show until late October, ensuring that by the time they set out to find a master of ceremonies, many superstars’ spring windows would already be booked. One of those busy stars was Hart, but the comedian has long expressed a wish to host the Oscars, and he was willing to move the pieces of his 2019 schedule around to accommodate the telecast. Still, not even an hour after the announcement late Tuesday that he would be hosting, anti-gay jokes that Hart had tweeted years ago began to recirculate. Instead of offering a thorough apology, Hart dug in his heels, and once the academy presented him with an ultimatum, Hart fell out of the show. Some people have asked me why Hart had not been vetted for the job, but I think the academy assumed his fame was all the due diligence needed. (The fact that Hart had not been called out for his anti-gay jokes with any real vehemence until now probably says more about us as a society than it does about the Oscars.) Still, it was another misstep for an awards body that was already reeling: The academy had sought to trim categories from the broadcast this year in pursuit of the shortest-ever Oscars, and instead it got the briefest hosting stint in history. When it needs to, the academy can move with measured precision. The continuing initiative to diversify its membership, prompted by two straight years of all-white acting nominees, has been undertaken with great thoughtfulness. Yet the Oscars as an entity are designed to be reactionary, since they can honor only what others have made and arrive at the end of annums that are growing more and more turbulent. It’s not clear where the Oscars will go from here, but perhaps that’s fitting after a cultural year that proves next steps can only spring from painful stumbles.

By William Logan Jan. 2, 2019 THE FLAME Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings By Leonard Cohen Edited by Robert Faggen and Alexandra Pleshoyano 277 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28. When a poet dies, his publishers often hurry into print whatever scraps lie stuffed in his desk drawers or overflow his wastebasket. This is the book business at its darkest and most human, but many balance sheets have been balanced by a posthumous work or two. Death is the moment when all eyes are upon the poet for the last time; beyond, for most harmless drudges, lies the abyss. Leonard Cohen, who died two years ago, wore many a fedora — poet, novelist, songwriter, a singer of sorts — but only the last trade, which he took up reluctantly, made him a star. Cohen was never taken very seriously as a poet. He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. Many found him a bit much, his heart-on-his-sleeve misery no more appealing than plunging your hands into boiling tar. Still, songs like “Suzanne,” “Bird on the Wire” and the rather preposterous hymn of praise “Hallelujah” have been so widely covered as to be nearly inescapable. At any moment of the day, “Suzanne” is probably playing in an elevator somewhere. Such songs now form the hoarse, moaning soundtrack to countless movies and television episodes. When a Cohen song rises from some awkward silence it’s a good bet the director has run out of ideas. The religiose sentimentality and painful growl, like a halibut with strep throat, have patched a lot of plot holes. He’ll give an emulsified version of everything the scriptwriter left unsaid. Image “The Flame” has a little of everything for Cohen fans and nothing for anyone else. The publicity matter claims the stray work has been “carefully selected”; but if this is the best of his barrel scrapings, there’s not much barrel to scrape. With a plan laid down by the singer himself, the editors have included his own choice of some 60 poems, the lyrics from his last four albums and a long dreary selection of notebook jottings. The pages have been decorated with 70 or so rumpled self-portraits (the singer’s amour propre came streaked in self-loathing), with a dozen amateurish doodles of young women thrown in. That perhaps represents the internal proportions of Cohen’s famous vanity and his equally famous lechery — I mean, of course, his search for a muse variously named Marianne, Sahara, Vanessa, Charmaine, Anjani, Mara, Sheila, Heather, Carolina and Olivia. How awful had any of his passing fancies passed unnoticed. The poems are monotonous scribbles of the moody-undergraduate school, what young Werther would have sung had he been Canadian: O apple of the world we weren’t married on the surface we were married at the core I can’t take it anymore. The long miseries and brief graces of love are Cohen’s obsessive subject. Some famous love poems by Bernart de Ventadorn and Dante sound almost as bad when translated, but Cohen doesn’t have that excuse. The poems might seem that much better in Provençal or Tuscan. Cohen favors an Audenesque quatrain with none of the puckish genius Auden used to refashion the form. What we get instead is: And from the wall a grazing wind weightless and serene wounds Me as I part Her lips and wounds Us in between And fastened here, surrendered to My Lover and My Lover, We spread and drown as lilies do— forever and forever. Cohen loves “poetic” lines that are nearly excruciating (“And now that I kneel / At the edge of my years / Let me fall through the mirror of love”), rhymes that would cripple a musk ox (plug/enough, sword/2005, art/Marx), and passages the C.I.A. should use only during enhanced interrogation (a couple “waving at desire / as it rests in the foreground / foothill-shaped, peaceful, / devoted as a dog made of tears”). The lyrics follow in cornucopian abundance, as if Cohen were possessed by a Dionysian mania forever unassuaged. Genial, sloppy, full of conventional lines, they sometimes have little twists that save them from disaster. Heavy on parallels and antitheses, they’re even heavier on abstractions, the words just a syllable or two, on rare occasions three, almost never four: The parking lot is empty They killed the neon sign It’s dark from here to St. Jovite It’s dark all down the line. Cohen could turn this stuff out all day, and it’s not half bad; but lyrics without music, even decent lyrics, look like dried lungfish in someone’s den, mounted on varnished plaques. The difference between his lyrics and poems is tissue-paper thin except when he was writing some wretched approximation of free verse: His cry his perfect word pitched against The baffled contradictions of the heart Wrestling them embracing them Strangling them with a jealous conjugal desperation. Cohen was not a poet who accidentally became a lyricist; he was a lyricist who for years fooled himself into thinking he was a poet. As poems these squibs are worthless; as lyrics, even sung in that lizardy groan, they often moved millions. His voice, that broken, battered thing, could make almost any song — even “God Save the Queen,” perhaps — sound lonesome, miserable, profound. If singing badly is no bar to stardom, everyone who stands caterwauling in the shower should take hope. You might not even need a whiskey-and-battery-acid cocktail to get there. The final section consists of disordered entries from the hundreds of notebooks Cohen picked up and pitched down over the years (one was discovered in his refrigerator freezer). Fans who have pined for wisdom like “I think, therefore I am / right up there with / Mary had a Little Lamb” or “I was thinking / of a room in Westminster / room / with a woman from Hell / who thought she was hot” may at last be gratified. (The book reproduces the manuscript of the latter. That extra “room” is a bad editorial decision — Cohen was probably just trying to clarify his handwriting.) In the notebooks, the singer writes, “Whatever happened to my place / in the Anthology of English Literature?” The better question is, Why should he be there in the first place? It’s hard to understand the cult of Leonard Cohen, the thousands who flocked to concert after concert, leaving with a feeling of illumination or exaltation, the sort of things for which people usually receive get-well cards. There are artists we don’t understand whom we are happy for others to love, and artists who attract an adoration that seems such a colossal mistake we can only shake our heads in bewilderment. Those who love Cohen may find in this gallimaufry the answer to their prayers. For everyone else, the only proper reaction is to shutter the windows and wait for the fever to pass.

arts Where the Thirst for Literature Meets the Thirst for Beer - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|Where the Thirst for Literature Meets the Thirst for Beer Supported by Book Territory Where the Thirst for Literature Meets the Thirst for Beer Image Book bindings serve as tap handles for the many craft-beer selections at Books & Brews.CreditCreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York Times By J. D. Biersdorfer Jan. 5, 2019 INDIANAPOLIS — The first thing one notices about Books & Brews is that it’s off the beaten path, tucked into an unassuming strip mall in a cluster of industrial-supply stores and a sprawling outpost of The Home Depot near 96th Street on the far north side of Indianapolis. The second thing you may notice upon entering the shop is how inviting it feels, with its bright, bookshelf-lined walls, clusters of sturdy wooden tables and racks of board games — and that’s before you get to the back of the store with a craft-beer taproom, small stage and even more packed bookshelves. “I started off here mainly because as a start-up, no one will lease to you,” said Jason Wuerfel, 38, the founder and president of Books & Brews, during a recent chat at the company’s “mother ship” location. But the lack of foot traffic hasn’t stopped his establishment from becoming a popular gathering spot. Image The Books & Brews “mother ship” store is located in a strip mall at 9402 Uptown Drive on the north side of Indianapolis.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York Times Image The taproom offers a wide selection of craft beers, all with literary-themed names.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York Times In addition to its titular fusion of bookshop and brewpub restaurant, Books & Brews is a de facto community center, drawing crowds to trivia contests, fund-raisers, tabletop game gatherings and literary events; Charlaine Harris, the author of “The Southern Vampire Mysteries” series, dropped by for a book signing in 2017. The stage in the back serves as a performance platform for music jams, open-mic nights and readings. “Our tagline is ‘a place for people without a place’ and it’s a very personal mission to me,” Wuerfel said. As an English major and member of the University of Michigan’s baseball team during his college years, he said he often felt he was “too jocky” for the nerds and too nerdy for the jocks. “I felt like someone who didn’t have a place.” His parents owned and operated hotels, as well as an independent minor-league baseball team, in Traverse City, Mich. In working with them, Wuerfel got a close-up look at entrepreneurship, customer service and the nuts and bolts of running a business. A later stint as a stay-at-home dad gave him the bandwidth to tinker with making his own beer, and he began to develop an idea for just the kind of place he wanted to create. Image The founder of Books & Brews, Jason Wuerfel, also built most of the furniture in the store.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York Times “The fundamental flaw of the bookstore is that it’s designed to be quiet and not let people connect to each other,” Wuerfel said. “When you encourage people to walk around, and you have books and board games and music that breathes life into spaces, you naturally provide the framework for social engagement.” A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that began in 2013 raised about $17,000 from more than 150 backers. To help keep costs down, Wuerfel taught himself carpentry and built most of the store’s wooden furniture himself. Image Yahtzee and other games are also on tap for visitors to Books & Brews.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York Times Books & Brews opened in March 2014, and Wuerfel’s vision of a place for people to “read, drink, converse” brought in the customers. He expanded his original footprint before the end of the first year to 4,500 square feet from 2,250 square feet by leasing the empty warehouse next door. “There were nights when I’d just run to Home Depot and buy folding chairs so people would have someplace to sit,” he recalled. The books for sale all around the store are mostly used, taken by donation and sold for $3 each. A corner nook of children’s books and a retro video-game setup await younger visitors. Ten percent of used-book sales are given to Indy Reads, an area organization that promotes literacy. Image Area residents share tasting flights of the various Books & Brews offerings.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York Times The store also offers a rack of new books for sale at the cover price, including titles by Indianapolis native Kurt Vonnegut Jr., whose maternal grandfather was Albert Lieber, a well-known local brewer in his day, and featured in Vonnegut’s autobiographical “Palm Sunday.” [Read the 1981 Times review of Kurt Vonnegut’s “Palm Sunday: An Autobiographical Collage.”] As for the brews, the company has its own line of craft beers, sporting playful names like Shogun Soba Ale and Charlie and the Chocolate Stout. Customers have even dubbed some of the beers — a librarian came up with “Nancy Brew and the Hoppy Boys,” the company’s popular pale ale. The Books & Brews mother ship is not alone anymore. Wuerfel expanded and franchised the business over the past few years to eight other locations (so far) around central Indiana and now partners with Flat12 Bierwerks to produce his beer. Image A Books & Brews bartender serves up one of the store’s many refreshment options.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York Times He credits much of his business model’s success to warm customer care and creating situations for guests to feel like they belong. “One hundred percent of the people who are here on any given night are here because they purposefully came for Books & Brews,” he said. “That is true destination appeal and really makes the atmosphere fantastic.” J.D.

arts Live-Streaming Your Broke Self for Rent Money - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Style Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Style|Live-Streaming Your Broke Self for Rent Money Supported by Video Live-Streaming Your Broke Self for Rent Money Jovan Hill, 25, dropped out of college and is unemployed. So how does he pay for his Brooklyn apartment and marijuana habit? His social media followers chip in. By Mike VilenskyDec. 8, 2018 On a lazy Sunday in September, Jovan Hill, a 25-year-old unemployed man in Brooklyn, had a small ask for the 7,100 strangers watching him on the live-streaming app Periscope: He needed $7,000, quickly. “Good morning, girls and gays,” Mr. Hill said, recording with an iPhone in one hand and smoking a marijuana blunt in the other. He wore a faded pink T-shirt, gray gym shorts and black Nikes. A black Pomeranian and two roommates could be spotted in his messy bedroom somewhere in the neighborhood of Carroll Gardens. In the rambling seven-minute video, he talks about wanting to move to Los Angeles (“This city just breaks you, I’m so bored of being broken”), spars with viewers who leave nasty comments (“I love all of you so much”), smokes his blunt and repeatedly asks for money. “I’m very poor today,” he said. “So if you want any tax write-offs, please donate to the Jovan charity.” Within minutes, the donations started flowing into his Venmo and PayPal accounts. Annie Wyrick, 25, a D.J. in Los Angeles, gave $100 along with a cryptic message: “Spiraling.” Rachel McFall, 22, a waitress in New Orleans, donated $10. Lindsay Scali, 21, an freelance filmmaker from Fort Myers, Fla., gave $1 with a note calling Mr. Hill the “unemployed king.” Image Jovan Hill at home in Brooklyn, where he live-streams his day-to-day existence to make money.CreditGioncarlo Valentine for The New York Times ‘Gay, Broke Diary’ By turns manic, flamboyant and sarcastic, Mr. Hill describes his output of live-streamed videos as a “gay, broke diary” that is inspired in equal parts by 4chan (the anonymous, often vulgar online message board) and his identity as a queer black man. “Like if a sloppy Tumblr blog and a 4chan thread had a mistake of a child,” he said. But to his 200,000 followers, spread across Periscope, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Patreon, Mr. Hill is not just another social media influencer seeking to leverage his microfame into money. His unscripted live-streamed show gives a raw, unfiltered window into the life of a bipolar 20-something striver, trying to eke out a meaningful existence without the crutch of family money, or a traditional job. “The only reason I wake up and go to work everyday is so I can give @ehjovan money for rent,” said Paige Wolfe, 23, a bank associate in Oklahoma City, in a tweet earlier this year. Fans like her have allowed Mr. Hill to cover his $1,300 monthly rent and living expenses, which include marijuana, help for his mother, video games and a $100 monthly budget for thrift store T-shirts. Mr. Hill is flummoxed by the generosity. “When I talk to friends who have known me for a long time, they could never understand sending a random person money, and I kind of feel the same way,” he said. “But it’s a community. A community based around me.” ‘Why Go to Work?’ Mr. Hill grew up in Missouri City, Tex., with 11 siblings and was raised by a single mother who was a Jehovah’s Witness. He retreated to online message boards and interactive role-playing games like MapleStory, where he would troll other players (often with nasty comments like “fatherless”). But as he got older, he shed his online anonymity and joined Tumblr, where he documented his life as a gay high schooler raised in a religious household. The generosity of his followers first came to light in 2016, when his grandmother’s power was turned off because of unpaid bills. “I was panicking because my grandma is my life,” he said. He asked his followers for help, thinking he might raise a few hundred dollars at best. They sent him the full $3,000. Image Why doesn't he get a real job? “I made this my job,” Mr. Hill said. CreditGioncarlo Valentine for The New York Times “That was the first time I realized my followers care about my well-being,” he said. Mr. Hill’s Tumblr following grew while he was studying at Texas State University, but he did not lean on them financially until this year, when he had a “manic episode” in January over a bad breakup and dropped out of college a few credits shy of graduating. With $22 in his pocket and a plane ticket his mother bought him, he came to New York City to start over. He moved into a basement apartment in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn with Jake Garner, another live-streaming influencer, who he met through Tumblr. Mr. Garner had their first month’s rent covered, but neither had regular income, so they began asking their followers for help. “We basically came to an agreement where it was like, if you want me to be sitting in my room and going live every day, you need to pay my rent,” Mr. Hill said. “At first that was like $300 to live in a basement, but then they wanted me to have a better life.” Mr. Hill got a job at a concession stand at a Chelsea movie theater but quit after a few weeks, never bothering to pick up his last paychecks. “I was making less money at the movie theater than sitting in my room live-streaming five times a day,” he said. “So why go to work?” He now makes upward of $4,000 a month, he said, through a mix of social media platforms. In addition to his call-outs on Periscope, he entices followers to pay $1 a month to unlock videos on Patreon, a subscription platform. He has also figured out how to raise funds through Twitter, by posting screen shots of Venmo donations to shame and entice fans to give more. Viewers occasionally ask him why he doesn’t get a traditional job, to which he replies: “I made this my job.” ‘Pop Culture Is Boring’ Mr. Hill is part of an emerging category of micro-influencers who have discovered there is a paying audience that wants to watch them go about their day-to-day lives. Many have been able to make money on Patreon, where people can sell subscriptions for their content, whether it be about comics, travel or nothing at all. Riley Whitelum, 34, and Elayna Carausu, 24, for example, have nearly 2,400 patrons paying $3 a month or more to watch them sail around the world on their channel, “Sailing La Vagabonde.” And then there is Paul Denino, 24, who goes by the avatar “Ice Poseidon” and live-streams for hours a day on Periscope, Twitch, YouTube and other platforms. For this, he can make some $60,000 a month, he said in a recent profile in The New Yorker. While Ice Poseidon has some 730,000 YouTube subscribers, many live-streamers have a few thousand at most. Image Mr. Hill shares the Brooklyn apartment with several roommates including Jake Garner, a fellow live-streamer. CreditGioncarlo Valentine for The New York Times Image The tools of his trade include an iPhone X and marijuana blunts. CreditGioncarlo Valentine for The New York Times Mr. Hill’s roommate, Mr. Garner, 22, earns a living through a combination of Periscope (1,400 followers), Twitch (200 subscribers paying $5 monthly) and Patreon (160 paying $1 to $20 a month). “Pop culture is so boring now compared to what it used to be, so a lot more people are clinging onto people online,” Mr. Garner said. During a 10-minute Periscope live stream from his parents’ home in suburban Delaware last month, Mr. Garner chatted about what brand of water he drinks, his favorite video games and whether he dyed his hair. Mr. Garner often streams with Mr. Hill as a duo, and the two are now making more money than they know what to do with, they say. “I know we can invest, but we hate capitalism,” Mr. Hill said. ‘I’ll Do Anything for $15’ These days Mr. Hill live-streams on Periscope about three times day, in segments that range from 10 to 30 minutes, often from his Brooklyn bedroom and occasionally on walks around Park Slope or at friends’ parties. Armed with his shaky camera (usually an iPhone), he rants about pop culture news, laments his childhood and commiserates about his hookups. He also smokes weed, eats quesadillas, plays music, calls friends, hosts parties and kills time on the internet — not unlike what many aimless 20-somethings do in their spare time. When he’s feeling punchy, he will spar with viewers. “Do something,” wrote a viewer with the handle @adiaa_z during a broadcast from his bedroom about four months ago. “What am I a monkey?” Mr. Hill said. “We’re sick of this shirt,” a viewer named @abriannaxcx said. “You’re all such haters,” he said. “I’ve gone to your Instagram and I see you wearing the same shirt you’ve had since eighth grade.” At least once, he asks for money. “I’ll do anything for $15,” he said in a recent video from Los Angeles, where he was streaming from an Airbnb. A few minutes in, a follower named Ashley requested “attention” for her $5 Venmo donation. “I love you, Ashley,” he said in a singsong voice. He talks in bursts of inspiration, then mumbles through lulls, and frequently changes topics. Mr. Hill says he was diagnosed as manic depressive and does not take any medication for it, which may explain the mood swings. “When I’m manic, I’m very impulsive, have no self-control, I waste my money, I have random, reckless sex,” he said in a video titled “Mania Periscope” from July, during which he said he was hyped up on Adderall. Then, as if remembering he has an audience, he added: “I didn’t ask anyone to follow me. You guys came out of nowhere.” (Mr. Hill later said he was being “a bit dramatic” and tries not be reckless.) His non sequiturs can be trivial (“My face is so fat today”) or wry (“Why would I wear sunscreen? I came to this planet to die”). He uses racial and gay slurs freely, saying sarcastically in one video: “I’m homophobic because gays have done nothing but ruin my quality of life.” Mr. Hill is also prolific on Twitter, sending more than 30 messages a days under the handle @jovanhill. (His earlier account, @ehjovan, was suspended after he got into a feud with K-pop fans.) His followers are enthralled. He has carved out a space where crowdfunding is a form of audience participation. When he went to Texas earlier this year for unpaid parking tickets, his followers sent him the money because they feared he might be arrested. “I didn’t even care, but they started sending money, saying, ‘You can’t tweet from jail,’” he said.

arts In ‘Network,’ a Stage Manager Comes Out of the Shadows - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|In ‘Network,’ a Stage Manager Comes Out of the Shadows Supported by In ‘Network,’ a Stage Manager Comes Out of the Shadows Image Timothy Semon, the stage manager for “Network,” does his job from a glass-walled control booth onstage.CreditCreditVincent Tullo for The New York Times By Sopan Deb Dec. 24, 2018 Timothy Semon, the stage manager for the Broadway adaptation of “Network,” is used to operating the spotlight. But being on the receiving end of its bright glare? Not so much. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of someone calling the show from onstage before,” Mr. Semon said. He was sitting on the Belasco Theater’s stage two hours before showtime earlier this month, in a glass box that serves as the broadcast control room for Howard Beale, the pugnacious, mad-as-hell news anchor played by Bryan Cranston. It’s also where he remains throughout the show itself. “Network” is directed by Ivo van Hove, who is no stranger to immersive and experimental works, including the 2015 adaptation of the Arthur Miller play “A View From the Bridge.” In this blistering satire of television and corporate greed, set in the ’70s, onstage camera operators beam images of the performers to banks of screens. One side of the stage is filled with audience members eating dinner. The glass box — where Mr. Semon coordinates the lighting and sound cues, the scenery moves and the video — is on the opposite side. One reason the production, both in London and on Broadway, anchored the stage manager inside that glass box was to give the audience a sense of spontaneity. “The idea is that the machine is being exposed and live at all times,” said Daniel Raggett, the associate director. Image Screens abound in the play, which stars Bryan Cranston as Howard Beale, the mad-as-hell news anchor. Mr. Semon is visible in the monitor on the right.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times There are several devices on the desks in the glass-encased soundproof control room onstage. Most of them aren’t props. There’s a communications box that allows Mr. Semon to contact other crew members with the press of a single button, while next to it is a box that cues lights that correspond with specific areas of the stage. Early on in rehearsals, the creative team let Mr. Semon focus on the technical side of his job. “They were really nice to me in the beginning and let me not, I guess, participate in the show until I was able to successfully call the show a couple times,” Mr. Semon said. Mr. Semon, a 38-year-old native of South Carolina, initially attended the University of Cincinnati to pursue an acting career. “But then they kicked me out,” he said with a laugh. “I was a bad actor.” And it was in the required classes on theater production where he found his calling. He transferred into a stage managing track. One of his earliest Broadway gigs was as an assistant stage manager for “Wicked.” Since then, in a nearly two decade career, he’s been behind the scenes for shows including “A Chorus Line,” “Cirque du Soleil Paramour” “Sunset Boulevard” and, most recently, the revival of “Angels In America,” starring Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield. But he’s never been in a show where he’s become a character, complete with name, Ricky, and a costume, a lime green button-down shirt, baggy bluejeans, beat-up shoes and a tie — which is exactly what a technical director for a cable news show at the time might wear. “I have my ’70s glasses, which is sort of exactly what I wore when I was six years old,” Mr. Semon said. “I’m totally part of the newsroom.” While he doesn’t have a line in the show, Ricky is referenced by an actor to give him a cue. And Mr. Semon needs to be very conscious of his comportment on stage. Early on in the show, Beale, Mr. Cranston’s character, says he is going to commit suicide. If the entire cast in the booth is in shock save one, the aesthetic is thrown off. “It kind of gives the game away a little bit,” Mr. Raggett said. In some camera angles, Mr. Semon is clearly visible behind Mr. Cranston, making his reactions all the more important. “I’ve written through the calling book: ‘Look at Bryan.’ ‘Duck.’ ‘Move your chair,’” Mr. Semon said. And what about Mr. Cranston’s advice? “Besides making fun of me not reacting, which I do now? He said, ‘Oh, in the speech you look at me.’ In the scene where he’s going nutty with his underwear, it’s essentially the entire glass box looking at him. I get that,” Mr. Semon said, referring to Beale’s “mad as hell” speech, during which he encourages the nation to share in his anger. Despite Mr. Semon’s nightly onstage performance, he does not join the actors for a bow. And that’s totally fine with him. “Network” has not rekindled his desire to be an actor. “I stand up at the end, and I wave to the cast,” he said. “That’s good enough.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C8 of the New York edition with the headline: In a Glass Box but Out of the Shadows.

Fear not: “I don’t think either of us is interested in assaulting the audience,” Mr. Weiss said. “I’m not interested in actively hurting people.” Mind you, Mr. Weiss, 30, also describes the first time he saw Ms. Mounsey perform what would become the first half of their show as “extremely terrifying” and “an absolutely chilling experience.” “[50/50] old school animation,” running Friday through Jan. 13, makes the most out of seemingly little. It lasts under an hour, has a minimal set, and is made up of two monologues, the first delivered by Ms. Mounsey and the second by Mo Fry Pasic. (Ms. Pasic and Sophie Weisskoff helped devise the second half.) [Other festivals in January: Read about an adaptation of Sarah Kane’s “4:48 Psychosis” at Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now and a play by Gracie Gardner at the Exponential Festival.] In her segment, Ms. Mounsey, 27, flirts with the outer limits of autofiction to build discomfort. “I begin with things that are very true to me, like I am talking about my relationship with my body, and it morphs into some things I’ve never done, that are horrible,” she said by phone. “But I manage to use a logic that is particular to me, the Julia speaking right now, to get to that place of extreme violence.” “I always feel that if I’ve done the monologue correctly, you don’t see her as a sociopath, you see her as a person who’s made choices,” Ms. Mounsey added. “I don’t know if I always achieve that. One of the first times I ever did it was at this performance night that Peter used to curate at Cloud City, and someone in the audience went ballistic, flipped me off, told me I should kill myself — while I was doing it.” The pair come from different but oddly compatible backgrounds. Ms. Mounsey has written poetry and was an assistant on an early version of Young Jean Lee’s “Straight White Men,” while Mr. Weiss — the director (“for lack of a better word,” he said), co-writer and sound designer of “[50/50] old school animation” — has spent quality time in the city’s alt-comedy scene alongside the likes of Ms. Pasic and Lorelei Ramirez, who has a show, “Alive! (For Now),” in Under the Radar’s Incoming section. Indeed, comedy seems to provide Ms. Mounsey and Mr. Mills the exact type of collaborators they need. “We’ve developed a pattern of working with comedians who are secretly really good actors,” Ms. Mounsey said. Mr. Weiss added: “A lot of the work we do requires people to inhabit a blurry version of themselves, and that is not a comfortable thing for a lot of actors capital A. There’s a huge comedy influence on the show, even though it gets maybe one laugh.” “There is one laugh in the second half, maybe,” Ms. Mounsey confirmed, sort of. “Yeah, one laugh.” She chuckled. “It’s a comedy show.” ONE MORE UNDER THE RADAR SHOW Proving that Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” is a bottomless fount of inspiration, the company New Saloon put different translations of it in a blender and out came the show “Minor Character.” Correction:  An earlier version of the event information with this article misstated the dates of the Under the Radar Festival.

Neither, however, is currently streaming, and nor are any of the other major movie winners except for Netflix’s “Roma,” which won prizes for its director, Alfonso Cuarón, and for best foreign language movie. [Here’s the complete list of Golden Globe winners.] The good news is, plenty of quality movie nominees can be streamed now, and many of the winners arrive online later this month, including “Rhapsody” (Jan. 22), “Star” (Jan. 15) and “The Wife” (Jan. 22), a little-seen film for which Glenn Close won best actress. Meanwhile, nearly all of the TV winners are already on subscription services or available for rental. Here’s a guide to the those major-category nominees and winners that are already a click away, along with excerpts from their New York Times reviews. Movies ‘Roma’ Won for: Best foreign language, best director. Nominated for: Best screenplay. “Many directors use spectacle to convey larger-than-life events while reserving devices like close-ups to express a character’s inner being. Here, [Alfonso] Cuarón uses both intimacy and monumentality to express the depths of ordinary life.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.) Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix. ‘BlacKkKlansman’ Nominated for: Best drama, best actor in a drama, best supporting actor. “‘BlacKkKlansman’ is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth. It’s an alarm clock ringing in the midst of a historical nightmare, and also a symphony, the rare piece of political popular art that works in all three dimensions.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.) Where to watch: Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. ‘Black Panther’ Nominated for: Best drama. “It wouldn’t be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars. Yet in its emphasis on black imagination, creation and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present. And in doing so opens up its world, and yours, beautifully.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.) Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix. Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. ‘Eighth Grade’ Nominated for: Best actress, musical or comedy. “There are few more poignant, exasperating creatures than teenage girls. And rarely are they as heart-pangingly real as the girl fumbling through the sharp, smart comedy ‘Eighth Grade.’” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.) Where to watch: Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube (streaming free to Amazon Prime subscribers starting Jan. 13). ‘Tully’ Nominated for: Best actress, musical or comedy. “[Charlize] Theron and [Mackenzie] Davis make a pleasurable, watchable pair — Ms. Davis is obviously happy to be the moon to Ms. Theron’s sun — but ‘Tully’ isn’t really interested in the sustaining joys of female bonding. It has a message to deliver, which is as sincere and decent as it is obvious: Mothers need help, sometimes serious help.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.) Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ Nominated for: Best musical or comedy; best actress, musical or comedy. “‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ a busy, fizzy movie winnowed from Kevin Kwan’s sprawling, dishy novel, sets up a series of clashes — between tradition and individualism, between the heart’s desire and familial duty, between insane wealth and prudent upward mobility — that are resolved with more laughter than tears. There are squalls of intrigue and a melodramatic cloudburst or two, but nothing that threatens to spoil the festivities.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.) Where to watch: Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. ‘The Old Man & the Gun’ Nominated for: Best actor, musical or comedy. “The proper compliment to give ‘The Old Man & The Gun’ is that it treats Mr. Redford with the respect he deserves. A charismatic minimalist from the start, he has lately — in the haunting ‘All is Lost’ and the mild-mannered ‘Our Souls at Night’ — offered a series of master classes in understatement. At a time when bluster, bragging and histrionic displays of self-pity are apparently the defining characteristics of American manhood, it’s nice to be reminded of the virtues of discretion and quiet.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.) Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. ‘Beautiful Boy’ Nominated for: Best supporting actor. “‘Beautiful Boy,’ rather than plumbing the hard emotional depths of its subject, skates on a surface of sentiment and gauzy visual beauty…But the picturesqueness and the flowing, music-video rhythms of the editing give the film a slick, evasive feel, as if it were too cautious or too cool to confront the worst of what it’s about.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.) Where to watch: Stream it on Amazon. ‘Incredibles 2’ Nominated for: Best animated. “Like his superheroes, [Director Brad] Bird is extraordinarily good at destruction, which is very much in evidence in the virtuosic, often delightful ‘Incredibles 2,’ which picks up narratively where the last movie left off.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.) Where to watch: Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. ‘Isle of Dogs’ Nominated for: Best animated. “‘Isle of Dogs’ is filled with exquisite illustrations, whimsical flourishes and nostalgic details — old-fashioned labels, computer punch cards — that thicken the texture of its imaginary world. But too often the movie feels overworked, fussy.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.) Where to watch: Stream it on HBO Now and HBO Go. Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. TV ‘The Americans’ Won for: Best series, drama. Nominated for: Best actor, drama; b est actress, drama. “[‘The Americans’ is a] remarkable accomplishment: It’s a subtle, complex portrait of a relationship etched into an engaging espionage thriller set in 1981, when Reagan was newly elected, and cars were big, and so was the Cold War.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Alessandra Stanley.) Where to watch: Stream it on Amazon. Buy it on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. ‘The Kominsky Method’ Won for: Best series, musical or comedy; b est actor, musical or comedy. Nominated for: Supporting actor. “‘The Kominsky Method’ isn’t a disaster; it has a certain warm-bath appeal, if you don’t mind a thick foam of prostate jokes. But it is adrift in a bland netherworld between Lorre’s precision-tooled, laugh-a-minute network comedies and the quieter aesthetic of the alt-sitcom, lacking the strengths of either.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Mike Hale.) Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix. ‘The Assassination of Gianni Versace: An American Crime Story’ Won for: Best series or TV movie, best actor in a limited series or TV movie. “At some point we’ll all have to grapple with the idea that the warped compassion of the modern true-crime boom implicates its audience and that viewers are greedily lining up to be part of a lurid long tail of suffering and despair. If ‘The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story’ were a little more interesting, maybe it would be that lightning rod. But instead it’s a surprisingly inert, if lushly imagined, tale.” (Click to read the full Times review by Margaret Lyons.)

arts Gifts Tied to Opioid Sales Invite a Question: Should Museums Vet Donors? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|Gifts Tied to Opioid Sales Invite a Question: Should Museums Vet Donors? Supported by Gifts Tied to Opioid Sales Invite a Question: Should Museums Vet Donors? Image The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which was listed as receiving about $13.1 million from the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation in 2012, opened the Sackler Courtyard in June.CreditCreditCarl Court/Getty Images By Colin Moynihan Dec. 1, 2017 Visitors to the Victoria and Albert Museum’s white porcelain plaza in London commonly walk past a wall that says “The Sackler Courtyard.” About a mile away, the words “Serpentine Sackler Gallery” appear above a colonnade running along the front of a former gunpowder repository turned art space. And across the Atlantic, the family’s name is attached to centers and programs at institutions like the Dia Arts Foundation, the Guggenheim and the American Museum of Natural History. Since the 1970s, the Sackler family has donated millions of dollars to prominent museums and cultural institutions. The name has become nearly synonymous with the arts. But two recent magazine articles, in The New Yorker and Esquire, have highlighted several family members’ connection to something else: OxyContin, a powerful painkilling narcotic that public officials say is among the most common drugs involved in prescription opioid overdose deaths. The reports focused on members of the Sackler clan who can trace part of their fortunes to Purdue Pharma, the privately held company that produces the drug. In 2007, the parent company of Purdue pleaded guilty to a federal felony charge of misbranding OxyContin with the intent to defraud or mislead. (The Sacklers personally were not accused of wrongdoing.) Now Purdue faces new lawsuits by state authorities as well as another federal investigation. But few institutions seem concerned that the money they have received may be tied, in some way, to a family fortune partly built on the sale of opioids. The New York Times surveyed 21 cultural organizations listed on tax forms as having received significant sums from foundations run by two Sackler brothers who led Purdue. Several, including the Guggenheim, declined to comment; others, like the Brooklyn Museum, ignored questions. None indicated that they would return donations or refuse them in the future. “We regularly assess our funding activities to ensure best practice,” wrote Zoë Franklin, a spokeswoman for the Victoria and Albert Museum, which was listed as receiving about $13.1 million from the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation in 2012. “The Sackler family continue to be an important and valuable donor to the V & A and we are grateful for their ongoing support.” Image Raymond Sackler, right, who died in July, with his wife, Beverly.CreditTaco van der Eb/Hollandse Hoogte, Redux To what degree are cultural institutions responsible for vetting every dollar they receive? Can financially strapped arts organizations be picky about a patron’s source of wealth, and if so, where should they draw the line? At a donor who engages in unlawful or unethical behavior? Or whose conduct is at odds with the institution’s goals? The issue stretches back to the days of Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and the Rockefellers, cultural philanthropists whose sources of income were characterized at some point as monopolistic, or anti-union or harmful to the environment. In 2015, to name a more recent example, some critics called for museums of science and natural history to cut ties with fossil fuel companies and philanthropists like David H. Koch, whose foundation has financed groups that went on to oppose legislation related to climate change or refer to “global warming hysteria.” (When Mr. Koch stepped down from the American Museum of Natural History’s board the following year, the museum said the decision was not prompted by the protests.) But museums have shown an unwillingness to return money or end a philanthropic relationship. “Historically, museum audiences have not shown evidence of being terribly concerned about sources of income for museums,” said Susie Wilkening, a museum consultant in Seattle. “Especially if there is no conflict between the mission of the museum and the philosophies or beliefs of the donor.” In the case of the Sacklers, OxyContin’s ties to the opioid crisis have become a public relations blemish. But activists have not mustered campaigns against institutions that benefit from the Sacklers’ largess. And there appears to be no push in Congress for members who have received donations from Purdue to return that money. The Times’ questions to the 21 institutions focused on money from five foundations that have been run by members of the Sackler family, including Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, two of the three Brooklyn-born physician brothers who transformed Purdue into a pharmaceutical giant. The two served as co-chief executives of Purdue before they died, and their foundations have given substantial sums to cultural and educational organizations since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. In some years, the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation has listed Purdue Pharma as one of its sources of money. Some of Mortimer and Raymond’s descendants have sat on the company’s board or held executive positions since the mid-90s. In response to inquiries by the Times, Purdue confirmed that Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, one of Mortimer’s daughters; Mortimer D.A. Sackler, one of his sons; and Theresa Elizabeth Sackler, his widow, are directors of the company’s board today. But the company did not say whether any other family members currently serve on the board and did not provide a requested list of those who did from 1995 to 2007. (The shares of Arthur Sackler, the eldest brother and third owner of Purdue, were bought by Mortimer and Raymond at some point, according to The New Yorker. Arthur’s descendants have said they have not profited from the sale of OxyContin.) In October, Purdue said that it was cooperating with a new federal investigation related to OxyContin. In response to lawsuits by New Jersey, Alaska and Washington, the company has vigorously denied allegations that it used deceptive marketing to boost sales of the drug. Robert Josephson, a spokesman for the company, pointed to its efforts to stem the opioid epidemic — distributing prescription guidelines, developing abuse-deterrent painkillers and ensuring access to overdose-reversal medication — and noted that OxyContin has never had a large share of total opioid prescriptions. In an email, he added, “Many leading medical, scientific, cultural and educational institutions throughout the world have been beneficiaries of Sackler family philanthropy.” Image The Guggenheim, which was listed as receiving $2.49 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation, declined to comment on this donation.CreditJewel Samad/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Risa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for the families of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, declined on their behalf to comment. Andrew Ross, a professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University, said that donors sometimes give hefty amounts to institutions in an effort to shift attention from business practices that may strike some as unsavory. Such donations have opened organizations to criticism. In the 1980s, for example, antismoking groups denounced the Joffrey Ballet and other institutions for accepting money from tobacco companies. “That’s a risk museums take on by having these sorts of trustees and donors,” Professor Ross said. “They are supposed to have ethical values baked in, and because they trade in culture we expect different standards from them.” But some in the arts world see the acceptance of donations not as an endorsement or political statement but simply as a way to support programming. Reynold Levy, who was president of Lincoln Center for 13 years, said institutions would be unlikely to change the behavior of donors by rejecting their money. And, he added, declining donations from people who are acting lawfully could create a slippery slope of shifting standards that would do little to benefit an organization’s audience. “For institutions to draw lines outside of the law, there would need to be a pretty heavy burden of persuasion to refuse a gift that would advance a meritorious mission,” he said, adding that at the same time “board members should feel free to raise these questions and issues.” Of course, it might be uncomfortable to begin such conversations when donors are closely tied to an institution. Mortimer D.A. Sackler, for example, is a trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which was recorded as receiving $2.49 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation between 2003 and 2015. Ilene Sackler Lefcourt is an honorary trustee of the American Museum of Natural History, which was listed as receiving $1.7 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation between 2006 and 2013. Anne Canty, a spokeswoman at the natural history museum, suggested that it needed time to take stock of the recent reporting on the Sacklers. “Since this has all emerged very recently, we haven’t had sufficient time to fully absorb it so we don’t have any comment,” she wrote.

Although his injuries were minor, Mr. Fischer, a financial planner, said the crash required extensive rehab and got him thinking. “I realized that, had I been killed, I wouldn’t have left much of an imprint” outside of business, he said. After the accident, the Fischers, of Head of the Harbor, N.Y., threw themselves into volunteer work for organizations including the Smithtown Township Arts Council. Mrs. Fischer retired early from her job in human resources at Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and devoted more time to these pursuits. By the mid-90s they were regularly purchasing works by painters they met through the arts council, including Agnes de Bethune and John Dorish. They still buy oils and acrylics in styles ranging from Abstract Expressionism to photorealism. But one day in 1995, on a visit to a friend in nearby Nissequogue who’d remodeled his garage around his growing glass collection, they found a new focus. “The minute the two of us saw his glass art, we thought it was great,” Mrs. Fischer said. Several weeks later they visited the Heller Gallery in Manhattan and bought their first glass object, “Solar Gray” by Michael Taylor, which consists of clear and black shardlike shapes radiating outward; it’s currently displayed in their bedroom. The Fischers bought four or five more pieces over the next several weeks and didn’t stop there. In 2005, having run out of space, they commissioned a 2,000-square-foot addition to their contemporary home.

The Fischers, who have no children, say they plan to give their collection to a museum someday, possibly a local one — “So we can see it when we want to,” Mr. Fischer said. In the meantime, Mrs. Fischer said, they continue to acquire pieces with a goal of upgrading their glass objects. Mr. Fischer is a board member of various glass collectors’ groups, and the couple are founding members of the Ennion Society of benefactors at the Corning Museum of Glass. They discussed their collection in a visit to their home on Long Island’s North Shore. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Image “Impression” (2001) by Latchezar Boyadjiev.CreditJoe Carrotta for The New York Times This is quite a collection! How have you built it? HARLAN FISCHER I find I either like a piece or I don’t. Generally I like pieces that are scaled large and display intense color. When Olivia and I started collecting glass, the feeling was similar to how I felt in high school when I discovered jazz. I heard a record of John Coltrane playing “My Favorite Things.” Epiphany! OLIVIA FISCHER One of my favorites is “Aver 4,” by Nicole Chesney. To me it is bold and vibrant, at the same time ethereal with mysterious depth. How do you acquire most of the art here? MRS. FISCHER Most of our collection comes from galleries. We go to the SOFA [Sculpture Objects Functional Art and Design] exhibition almost every year. And a few pieces are purchased from friends. MR. FISCHER We try not to walk into galleries as strangers. We usually acquire works by established artists. We listen to suggestions, too. Image “City Scape” (1999) by Jay Musler, in the Fischers’ collection.CreditJoe Carrotta for The New York Times It must be challenging to move some of these pieces, yet you do it. MR. FISCHER When we built the addition, we needed to move “Spiral of Life” [by Ivana Houserova] to a place between our dining room and our new gallery. We contacted Jitka Pokorna, who owned the gallery in Prague where we bought the piece. Coincidentally, she and her staff were about to fly to the SOFA exhibition in Chicago and were stopping over in Newark. We had a car pick them up at Newark and bring them here. That afternoon the four of them disassembled the piece, moved it, and reassembled it. It weighs at least 450 pounds. How much does such a housecall cost? MR. FISCHER They didn’t charge me anything. We had gotten several pieces from Jitka. Actually we got more pieces from her than anybody. When they were here, I asked what they wanted to eat and they all said “pizza” in unison. I guess the only word they all knew in English was pizza. Did you get them pizza? MR. FISCHER Yeah, I had pies delivered from a local place. They all chowed down. They stayed overnight and flew out to Chicago the next day.

Paper, $19.95. Image In Harun’s new collection, no family is undamaged, and domestic squabbling is the least of it: Adults murder kids, kids murder adults, savage little ones are dumped with far-flung relatives, righteous children abscond and their relieved parents bolt in the opposite direction. In “The Farmhouse Wife,” a man spurns his partner to sleep with a spectral figure, herself an apparent child-killer and husband-poisoner. Police-scanner shorthand for a barbaric discovery gives its title to “Two Girls Off Quarry Road.” Told in poised, often shimmering prose, these tales distress and confound. Harun is alive to the fundamental enigma and mutability of violence. Seldom does she burden herself with articulating either its roots or its evolution. “Lost in the War of the Beautiful Lads” sees a mother attempt to safeguard her daughter by moving to a rustic island, only to realize that “we carry the terrors of civilization within us.” Harun’s resolutions rarely resolve, instead they galvanize into new, uncertain beginnings. “Pink Cloud,” for instance, seems an oversweet depiction of two recovering alcoholics watching the sun descend, until, in the story’s final paragraph, “his eyes flicked toward a kitchen cupboard.” A few stories are insubstantial; one is discordantly political. But the larger, tragic landscape Harun sketches is acutely destabilizing, wonderfully inscrutable and, at moments, ravenously absurd. BETTER TIMES By Sara Batkie 140 pp. University of Nebraska. Paper, $17.95. Image At first glance, Batkie’s debut collection appears precariously schematic. Women — lonesome, scarred, wobbling — lead each of the nine stories, which are tidily sorted into three sections: past, present and future. Batkie’s writing is equally disciplined, radiating vibrant, if somewhat vacant, charisma like a practiced holiday guest. But that’s before a trio of late stories achieve an alchemical feat, gold-plating the collection’s themes. Metaphors (for alienation, for insatiate desire) are marvelously transformed into the literal; existential fears (of purpose, of worth) mutate devilishly into the corporeal. In “Cleavage,” a spiritually lost woman suffers physical loss from a mastectomy, only to be tormented by her detached breast, “clawing and clinging like a fidgety child.” The 27-year-old in “Lookaftering,” sensing “a strange uncoiling in her stomach, like a snake letting loose from a trick can,” finds she’s laid a clutch of eggs, a manifestation of her insecurities about love and maternity. Batkie’s stories shrewdly commingle the hopeless and the hopeful. Her women, demoralized by the absence of fathers and husbands, by stunted careers and aimless children, are locked in self-doubt and self-flagellation, though rarely do they lose faith in “better times,” even when they’ve had slim experience of them. “I did miss being loved,” one character laments, “if you can miss a feeling you have no proof of ever having.” ITS COLOURS THEY ARE FINE By Alan Spence 258 pp. Canongate. Paper, $16. Image Through an approach perfected by James Joyce and Sherwood Anderson, Spence’s debut collection, first published in 1977 and newly reissued, surveys a narrow locale to disclose widespread truths. With remarkable precision and emotional weight, these stories depict working-class Glasgow: slummy, rowdy, tribal, drunken, despondent, quixotic and irrepressible. Characters, partitioned into “proddies” and “cathlicks,” are nearly always male, from wily schoolboys who prank their neighbors to desperate teenagers who unleash their discontent at the club. Husbands squander their wages on “the last lingering pint and the chip-shop queue”; old men, clutching flimsy welfare checks, “walk around and fill in the day.” Everything and nothing seems to be shifting. A mother dies, and her son gazes out the window: “It was very ordinary. … The sun shone on the greybrick tenement buildings, on the railings and the tumbledown walls and middens, on the dustbins and the spilled ashes.” Only his imagination locates God in the clouds. Spence achieves his gravelly realism through raw detail (“Listen. The drip and patter of the rain on wet cardboard”) and deft use of the vernacular (“So ah says tae her ah says Margaret ah says”). He trades customary conflicts and epiphanies for documentary snapshots. In the title story, a man goes on a political march, overdrinks, is called a fascist and hurls a bottle into “the terrible darkness.” In “Tinsel,” a boy decorates his tenement for Christmas, and what reflects in his window is a fantasy “he could never enter.” THE DOGS OF DETROIT By Brad Felver 169 pp. University of Pittsburgh. $21.95. Image Sorrow and confusion have turned the men in Felver’s zero-sum world into animals. Shaken by tragedy and fueled with masculine pride, they aim to heal by inflicting maximum hurt. Felver’s families crack, and those left behind, bereft of compassion, turn diabolical in their pursuit of torture: of others and of themselves. Life is nothing beyond “an untended aggression” concludes the boy in the title story, who, after losing his drug-addled mother, savors envisioning “the worst things possible: toddler coffins, flayed penguins, pipe bombs in convents, napalm in orphanages.” (He settles for executing Detroit’s stray dogs.) Other characters jam screwdrivers underneath fingernails and snap shins in bear traps. According to the narrator of “How to Throw a Punch,” “Once you learn how to do it, you want to do it often.” Felver can be inventive with tone, diction and perspective — and heartbreakingly solemn when he wants to be. Both “The Era of Good Feelings,” in which a high-school history teacher, burying his father, appraises his personal past, and “Hide-and-Seek,” in which estranged brothers collide at an airport bar, coolly dissect woe amid death and regret. But more often “The Dogs of Detroit” proves a shallow riff on an isolated theme. Felver may situate his tales from New York through Ohio up to Montana but their gratuitous savagery homogenizes these settings. Characters are similarly flattened by their penchant for destruction. Lines like “What would we do now, what would we hate now?” become their unthinking refrain. Mike Peed has written for The New Yorker, The Washington Post and other publications.

arts ‘S.N.L’: Robert De Niro Plays Robert Mueller, and Haunts Eric Trump - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|‘S.N.L’: Robert De Niro Plays Robert Mueller, and Haunts Eric Trump Supported by ‘S.N.L’: Robert De Niro Plays Robert Mueller, and Haunts Eric Trump Image Robert De Niro, left, reprised his role as the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, on “Saturday Night Live,” haunting the bedside of Eric Trump (played by Alex Moffat).CreditCreditNBC By Dave Itzkoff Dec. 9, 2018 If a stack of documents released on Friday by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and by federal prosecutors in New York were too much to keep up with, why not conclude your week with a bedtime story in the company of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.? “Saturday Night Live” opened this week’s broadcast in the Trump Tower bedroom of Eric (played by Alex Moffat), as he timidly told his older brother, Donald Jr. (Mikey Day), that he feared something sinister was in his closet. Day told him: “Eric, there’s no boogeyman in your closet. Have you been watching the news again? You can’t watch that stuff, bud. It’s too grown-up.” via YouTubeCreditCreditVideo by Saturday Night Live As Don Jr., Day then began to read Eric a portion of Clement Clarke Moore’s “A Visit From St. Nicholas,” but he was interrupted by a mysterious noise. “There’s something in my closet,” Moffat said. Day answered: “That’s just the cheap steel dad uses to build his towers. They just groan in the wind.” He then threw open the closet door to reveal Mueller (played by Robert De Niro, a recurring guest role), who gave Moffat a silent gesture to warn that he had his eyes on him. After Day left the bedroom to take a call from his lawyer (“How bad is it? … But can I flip on him?”), De Niro sat down at the side of the bed next to Moffat. “Don’t be scared,” De Niro said. “It’s just me, Robert Mueller, your dad’s friend from work.” Moffat replied, “I’m not allowed to talk to you.” “That’s fine, Eric,” said De Niro. “It was pretty clear early on that you don’t know anything. I wish I could say the same for some of your dad’s friends.” As the sketch later wrapped up, Moffat said, “Mr. Mueller, people say you’re the worst thing to ever happen to my dad.” “No, Eric,” answered De Niro. “Getting elected president was the worst thing that ever happened to your dad.” In other memorable moments from the show: Prime-Time Soap Opera of the Week “S.N.L.” returned to the Oval Office for a mash-up of recent White House intrigue and the Fox series “Empire” called “Them Trumps.” As a narrator described it, the show is the first to ask the question “What if Donald Trump was black?” As the sketch began, President Darius Trump (Kenan Thompson) was told by an aide (Moffat) that the walls were closing in on him: “They know about Russia,” Moffat said. “They know you used campaign money to cover up an affair with Magic City stripper Cinnamon Mercedes. And they know about the pyramid scheme you’ve been running through your company, Darius Trump Country Hams.” Thompson responded by beginning to deliver a dramatic monologue. “Maybe I’ve done some dirty things, but I’m making America great again,” he said. “And what these feds don’t realize is that I’m the president. The most powerful man in the most respected office in the world. They can’t lock me up. And even though I may be black ——” At that moment, F.B.I. agents immediately stormed the room and arrested Trump. “Yeah, that sounds about right,” Thompson quipped. ‘Game of Thrones’ Parody of the Week If you’ve been hard up for “Game of Thrones” content since the most recent season ended in 2017, you could do worse than “Khal Drogo’s Ghost Dojo,” a public access TV show where “we talk with some of the hundreds of characters from ‘Game of Thrones’ who have been killed off the show,” as Thompson, a co-host, explained. The sketch was mostly an excuse to let this week’s guest host, Jason Momoa, reprise his “Game of Thrones” role as the warrior Khal Drogo and to let cast members impersonate “Thrones” characters. It also included an exchange between Momoa and Heidi Gardner, playing Brienne of Tarth, that referenced the recent troubles of Kevin Hart, who withdrew as host of the Academy Awards after refusing to apologize for anti-gay jokes. In his Dothraki language (translated by subtitles), Momoa said of Gardner, “If this man wants to fight, I’ll give him what he wants.” Gardner replied incredulously: “Man? Wow, you have a lot to learn about identity politics.” “You’re right,” a chastened Momoa said in broken English. “Khal need to learn from Khal’s mistakes or Khal never win Oscar. Never host Oscar.” Taking in the scene, Thompson said, “Wow, what a teachable moment.” Weekend Update Jokes of the Week At the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the latest developments in the Mueller investigation. Jost: This week, Robert Mueller released the teaser trailer for “Trump: Endgame.” Federal prosecutors said Friday that Michael Cohen committed two election-related crimes at the direction of a person identified as Individual-1. Now, we don’t know for sure who Individual-1 is. But let’s just say things are getting tense right now over at Individual-1 Tower. Earlier today, Trump called the Mueller report “collusion illusion.” Which is also my favorite Guns N’ Roses album. And yesterday, Trump tweeted, with no context or explanation: “Totally clears the president. Thank you!” Sounds like somebody’s been reading “The Secret.” Che: Trump is now calling for an end to the Mueller probe, which, I’ve got to admit, it’s worth a shot. You don’t want to go to jail and then find out you could’ve just called it off the whole time. The scariest thing about watching Trump be president is that he tries all the things that I would try. President Trump also tweeted that he “will be doing a major counter report to the Mueller report.” Well, you better hurry up, bud, because you only get one hour a day on that prison computer. Also, nothing says you’re guilty more than making a counter report before the Mueller report is even out. That means he knows it’s going to be bad. That’s like when you’re watching “Cops” and as soon as they pull up to the house, there’s already a shirtless guy on the lawn, saying, “O.K., now first of all, she’s lying.” Jost also dug into the announcement that Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, plans to leave the White House: President Trump announced today that John Kelly, his chief of staff, is leaving his position at the end of the year, because Kelly requires extensive surgery to remove his palm from his face. That’s how awful it is to work in the Trump White House, by the way. John Kelly spent 40 years in the Marines. He did three tours in Iraq. And he couldn’t finish one tour with Donald Trump. And Che later went on to offer an awkward defense of sorts for Kevin Hart. Well, that was short. Kevin Hart had to step down as host of the upcoming Academy Awards because of homophobic tweets from 2011. But didn’t the Academy nominate Mel Gibson for an award just last year? Also, if Kevin Hart isn’t clean enough to host the Oscars, then no black comic is. The only black comic I know that’s cleaner than Kevin Hart is booked for the next three to 10 years.

arts Artwork Taken From Africa, Returning to a Home Transformed - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|Artwork Taken From Africa, Returning to a Home Transformed Supported by Artwork Taken From Africa, Returning to a Home Transformed A pivotal report calls for thousands of artworks to leave French museums and return to West Africa. An artist, a historian and a philosopher debate what should happen — and what these objects could mean to young Africans who have never seen them. Image From left: Souleymane Bachir Diagne, Toyin Ojih Odutola and Cécile Fromont discuss the potential return of art to Africa at Ponty Bistro in Harlem.CreditCreditNina Westervelt for The New York Times By Jason Farago Jan. 3, 2019 When Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told students in Burkina Faso in 2017 that he wanted to see a “temporary or permanent restitution” of African art in French collections, no one in the museum world could be sure whether it would happen. Then came publication on Nov. 21 of a blockbuster report, written for Mr. Macron by Bénédicte Savoy of France and Felwine Sarr of Senegal, which calls for the return of possibly thousands of works of art. Suddenly, the door was opening to what could be the largest shake-up ever of European museums with objects acquired during the colonial era. Mr. Macron’s office then announced the return “without delay” to Benin of 26 sculptures in the collection of the Musée du Quai Branly, which holds more than two-thirds of France’s 90,000 African treasures. But doing so, the report allows, may require new legislation to enable national museums to deaccession state-owned art. The report has now made waves across Europe, and directors of museums with large colonial holdings, including the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum and Berlin’s soon-to-open Humboldt Forum, have expressed serious reservations about Ms. Savoy and Mr. Sarr’s call for restitution. But how do Africans see the challenges, both practical and philosophical, of restituting works of art? What does the Savoy-Sarr report augur for African museums, African governments and African artists? And what new meanings might these works of art accrue if they are returned to where they were made centuries ago? I posed those questions recently to three people with deep experience in African art. Souleymane Bachir Diagne is a Senegalese philosopher and professor of French at Columbia University who advised Ms. Savoy and Mr. Sarr on parts of the report; Cécile Fromont, associate professor at Yale University, is a French art historian who specializes in exchanges between African and European populations; and Toyin Ojih Odutola is a Nigerian-American artist, whose painstaking fictional portraits were seen last year in a Whitney Museum solo show and are on view through Feb. 3 in “For Opacity,” at the Drawing Center in Manhattan. These are edited excerpts from the conversation, over dinner at a Harlem restaurant. (The menu, suitably, was French/West African.) Image The Ife Head, which entered the collection of the British Museum in London in 1939. It was created around 1400 by a Yoruba artist in present-day Nigeria.CreditTrustees of the British Museum Before turning to the report, I thought I’d ask you about your initial experiences of African art, in your youths. Were they in western institutions? TOYIN OJIH ODUTOLA I was born in Ife, Nigeria, and moved to the United States when I was 5. First to California, and then I grew up in Alabama. I think the first time I encountered African art was when I went back to Ife. I was 16. We went to the university where my parents met, which has some of the Ife bronze heads [a suite of extraordinary copper busts from the 13th to 14th centuries]. I remember we had a tour, and the tour guide was salty about how few bronzes were left at the institution. I’d never seen them before in my life, yet I knew immediately what I was looking at. SOULEYMANE BACHIR DIAGNE I grew up in Senegal, and did my primary education there. I went to the Musée Dynamique in Dakar as a student. But the first time I really encountered African art was at the Musée de l’Homme, in Paris. The anthropology museum. Picasso’s haunt. MR. DIAGNE Exactly. When it was still at the Trocadéro. It must have been back in 1974. I was taken there by my cousin, who was an archaeologist. And I had a wonderful tour. CÉCILE FROMONT I was born and raised in Martinique, which is still part of France. To some extent, living as part of the diaspora, African expressive cultures were all around. For me the carnival masquerades would have been the most striking, intimate encounters with the black Atlantic. Do you remember your first reactions to Mr. Macron’s speech in Ouagadougou, when he called for the “temporary or permanent restitution” of African art? MS. FROMONT I was astonished. I never thought in my lifetime, or even in my children’s lifetimes, that this change of tone would happen in France. At the same time, because it was such a political speech, I wondered if anything would come of it. And then the report was another thunderbolt! The report has no legal force. But these words are out there, with some political sanction behind them. Image Souleymane Bachir Diagne and Toyin Ojih Odutola.CreditNina Westervelt for The New York Times MR. DIAGNE It was only when I heard that Macron had nominated Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy, whom I know, that I thought: something new is happening. They were not going to deliver some watered-down report. Ms. Savoy, an art historian, recently resigned as an adviser to the Humboldt Forum, a new museum in Berlin; she said it wasn’t taking issues of provenance seriously enough. MR. DIAGNE She is someone who stands her ground, and that is the case for Felwine also. I spoke to them often as they were writing the report. They consulted widely. They traveled back and forth to Senegal, Mali, Cameroon. And they spoke with people in the president’s office, who gave them legal advice. The biggest surprise, even shock, of the Savoy-Sarr report is that it explicitly says that only full restitution of works of art will be acceptable. Curators have dodged this debate before by pointing to France’s centuries-old “inalienability” law; national institutions do not have the right to deaccession anything in a public collection. Savoy and Sarr say: no, the law has to change, it is the only morally responsible thing to do. MS. FROMONT That’s why the report is potentially so impactful. It demands that the logic of France’s relationship to Africa be renegotiated. It’s not simply about the objects, and where they are. By insisting on full restitution, the idea of “long-term loans” to African countries becomes as absurd as it sounds. MS. OJIH ODUTOLA There has to be a principle that both African and European institutions agree with. MR. DIAGNE When I had my first conversations with Felwine, he was telling me that many of his interlocutors — civil servants, functionaries, or museum people — would tell him, “You see, it is so complicated legally. We should really agree on the principle that these objects need to circulate.” The concept of circulation was being sold to him. And he said, yes, circulation makes sense. Somehow Africa has to share its art with the rest of the world. But Macron said “restitution,” and restitution has a meaning. So the authors said, we will be sticking to that word. If there is going to be circulation, it should be Africa lending the objects, not the other way around. MS. FROMONT Maybe in the future African countries will make long-term loans to Quai Branly! Image Three sculptures taken from the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, and now in the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron said 26 works, including these three, would be returned to Benin following the publication of the Savoy-Sarr report.CreditPhilippe Wojazer/Reuters Image The throne of King Ghezo, a ruler of Dahomey, is also slated to return to Benin from France.CreditGerard Julien/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In announcing the return to Benin of more than two dozen masterpieces in Quai Branly, Mr. Macron said “legislative measures, if necessary” would be taken. MR. DIAGNE These 26 objects were a good place to start, for many different reasons. First, symbolically: This was the kind of restitution that would give full weight to Macron’s promise. These were spoils of war, taken punitively after a well-documented historical battle, and put in the Trocadéro. They were taken directly from a king, the king of Dahomey. The second aspect is that some of these works were already lent to Benin. They were on view in Cotonou in 2006, and drew 275,000 visitors in an African country where people do not usually go to museums. MS. FROMONT One of the most striking photographs of the Cotonou exhibition of the Dahomey treasures shows this long line of schoolchildren waiting to go in. And that is everything. Even if it’s sentimental to some extent, it’s also historically powerful in the French imagination. French national collections are central to the education of the citizen. That’s what the Louvre was meant to do: create the French citizen. So if it’s that important for France, you have to be really hypocritical to say that it’s not equally important for the children of Benin. Image The exhibition “Behanzin, King of Abomey” opened in December 2006 at the Zinsou Foundation in Cotonou, Benin, and attracted 275,000 visitors.CreditFondation Zinsou These works slated to return to Benin are clear examples of plunder. But the report implies that every object that left Africa during the colonial era is a possible candidate for restitution — that just because a work of art was bought, rather than pillaged, it may still be ill-gotten. This is a recipe for emptying Europe’s museums, isn’t it? MS. OJIH ODUTOLA Absolutely! [Laughter] First of all, the whole concept of provenance is hogwash in that respect. The museums desperately want to find an original proof of purchase, but there is no original sale, not usually. They have always gone through many hands. Still, it’s not so much that we’re returning them back to their original home. The whole concept of “return” is very strange to me, because we know what they’re returning to is not where they came from. The context is completely altered. Yet I also understand that seeing the Benin Bronzes [over 1,000 plaques and sculptures looted nearly two centuries ago from the Kingdom of Benin, now southern Nigeria] in the British Museum is even less natural than seeing them in an African museum. MR. DIAGNE We should not dismiss the idea that the colonial space was also a space of transaction, though that would probably be the exception. But Toyin makes a crucial point: To what degree can you have consent within a colonial context? Michel Leiris, in “Phantom Africa” [from 1934], tells the story of ethnologists who wanted these sacred objects; and then out of guilt they paid a few francs. Technically, they “bought” them, but we see what buying means. MS. OJIH ODUTOLA I am looking forward to seeing these objects escape from the trauma of colonialism at some point. Every time we discuss these objects, we mention the “violence” of colonialism — but many were created before that! Image The Benin Bronzes at the British Museum. They were taken from present-day Nigeria by British troops in 1897.CreditDan Kitwood/Getty Images I see a tension in the report between two ideas. On the one hand, Ms. Savoy and Mr. Sarr are talking about African art as the heritage of world civilization — these are masterpieces that speak to everyone. On the other, they are talking about “rightful owners,” and saying that these works are incomplete in a European museum. MS. OJIH ODUTOLA They actually make this point at the end of the report, about “creolization.” These works of art now have European and African histories. We want a more hybrid understanding, and we still want these objects to circulate. But they should circulate from Africa! And within Africa. And not just within a European definition of what counts as art. MR. DIAGNE Sub-Saharan Africa cannot be the only region of the world where 90 to 95 percent of its heritage is abroad. MS. FROMONT For objects to circulate globally, with real fluidity, Africans have to have the means to participate. If they have ownership of the objects, then they can participate in the exchange. They can send some of the African patrimony abroad, and receive other pieces in return. Whereas long-term loans from Europe to Africa don’t change the structure of the relationship. What matters in this debate is that the asymmetry between the two sides is so grotesque — there is no other word. MR. DIAGNE There is a word that the report uses: resocialiser. These objects, if they go back to Africa, have to be “resocialized” — in other words, they are going to take on new meanings. It’s not a matter of reconstituting them whatever authenticity they had before. Recently, I have been working with the Metropolitan Museum of Art on an upcoming exhibition on the Sahel region [of West Africa], and they want to borrow a piece from Senegal. This object, that we cherish in Africa, needs to be shown in the United States. MS. OJIH ODUTOLA But why does it need to be shown only at an institution like the Met? MR. DIAGNE Because a culture is always on display. One place to do that is at the Met — and if you say, “This comes from Senegal, from the Musée de l’IFAN, and it’s going back there,” it means: You have the privilege to see it here in New York, but Africa is where it belongs. MS. OJIH ODUTOLA I see what you’re saying, and O.K., I don’t want to clear out museums. But what really hurts me, as an artist, is: Why are the Western institutions the most valid ones? What I’d like to see us move toward is the construction of institutions on the continent on par with Western institutions. I would love to have my work one day to be in Lagos, to be in Dakar, without any asterisk attached to it. Image Cécile Fromont and Jason Farago.CreditNina Westervelt for The New York Times MS. FROMONT We can’t even fathom what new African museums could be, and what they could do. Look at Latin America, for example. The museological innovations there — unique types of exhibitions, involvement with the communities — challenge in all the best ways what big museums around the world have been doing. When you think about the talent and expertise born from an enriched African museum landscape: that’s exhilarating. MS. OJIH ODUTOLA I thought about the contemporary art world a lot when I was reading the report, too. If you were to put these institutions in Africa, it would really change the landscape of how people move in our world. We say we’re “global,” but really we’re not. There’s Dakar, and Johannesburg, but that’s kind of it. The director of Quai Branly called the report “a bad answer to the courageous question posed by the president.” And other directors have said the best place to narrate these plural histories is in a universal, encyclopedic museum, like the Met or the British Museum. We know they have colonial baggage; we know most Africans can’t even get a visa to come see them. But what do you think of the argument that universal museums have a unique capability to put these artworks in their full context? MS. OJIH ODUTOLA I just think that reeks of colonizing the meaning of these objects. No one on the other side is speaking. We don’t even know what Africans would say, because they haven’t had the opportunity. All we’re asking, and I think what the report is saying, is: just give us a chance to try. MS. FROMONT To argue that the universal museum, founded in Europe in a particular historical context, is a solution for the entire world is maybe a little hypocritical. A true global museum needs a multiplicity of perspectives, including from African youth who will see their heritage and become the new thinkers and writers of the next generation. And of course it’s nerve-racking when objects move, in any context — things get lost, things get broken. But there is so much to be gained by it, for everybody. MS. OJIH ODUTOLA What new languages can form when a child looks at these objects? What new art can come from that? Seeing the Ife bronzes as a teenager, seeing the scarification, seeing that language of the skin, left an indelible mark in me, because now I do that in my work, even if I wasn’t cognizant of it at the time. MR. DIAGNE So this brings me back to this word “resocalizing.” It’s not a matter of restituting these objects to the particular ethnic group they belong to, in order to replace them in the rituals they were part of. That’s impossible. Malraux famously said that art starts when the gods have departed. And it’s true, for African art and for Western art. Yet these objects still have an aesthetic intensity — these objects are energized. And what is asked in this report is the freedom to create a new energy there.

arts High Drama, High Contrast: Finding the Baroque in Contemporary Art - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Arts Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Arts|High Drama, High Contrast: Finding the Baroque in Contemporary Art Supported by High Drama, High Contrast: Finding the Baroque in Contemporary Art Image Edward Kienholz’s “Five Car Stud,” on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp, Belgium, was one of the most controversial and mythologized artworks of the 1970s. Its depiction of violence in light and dark reaches Baroque heights of intensity and drama.CreditCreditFondazione Prada, via M HKA By Jason Farago July 23, 2018 ANTWERP, Belgium — This low-lying, discreetly wealthy city tends to a restrained approach to art and design today: Its riverside shops are full of stark, spare furniture, and its renowned fashion designers will sell you any number of black suits and shifts. But in the early 17th century, when Peter Paul Rubens shipped thousands of paintings out of the largest workshop in Europe, Antwerp’s house style was a much bolder affair. Head to the main cathedral here, for which Rubens painted his grandiose “Descent From the Cross,” and look at the eight figures bringing down Christ’s body in a torrent of sweeping fabrics and slashing light. The movement, the exaggeration, the unashamed flamboyance: This, my friends, is Flemish Baroque art in all its majesty. Antwerp is in full Baroque mode, with half a dozen museums devoting their summer programming to the high-drama art of the 17th century, and to Rubens, the city’s favorite son. Even the Museum of Contemporary Art has got in the 17th-century spirit with the substantial exhibition “Sanguine/Bloedrood,” an exercise in luster, mortality and timeline-smashing. Recent works by Sigmar Polke, On Kawara and Marlene Dumas share space with a major late work by Caravaggio, and portraits by Anthony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens. The curator of “Sanguine/Bloedrood” is Luc Tuymans — the artist who bestrides Antwerp’s scene today as Rubens did four centuries ago, though his paintings are as cool and color-sapped as Rubens’s are showy and saturated. Mr. Tuymans is a practiced curator, a rarity among artists: In 2016 he organized a well-received retrospective of the Belgian Expressionist James Ensor at the Royal Academy in London, and he has curated shows of German Romanticism and Polish contemporary art. “Sanguine/Bloedrood” is not one of his more demanding curatorial efforts: It has nothing much to say about the older Baroque art on view, and its propositions rest too heavily on the offbeat contrasts that characterize “artist’s choice” shows. Still, it’s worth scrambling expectations from time to time, and there is a certain pleasure in encountering Baroque paintings and sculptures in the purified realm of a contemporary art museum. The show’s anchor is Caravaggio’s “Flagellation of Christ,” painted in 1607-8, in which the bearded, thorn-crowned son of God looks downward as two men tie him to a column while a third prepares to flog his naked body with a cat-o’-nine-tails. Jesus’ bright, alabaster flesh is set off from the shadowy background in intense chiaroscuro, which Mr. Tuymans compounds by displaying the painting under a spotlight in an all-black circular gallery. The “Flagellation” hangs here near two startling gilded statues of Mary and St. John by the lesser-known sculptor Johann Georg Pinsel, as well as a C-list St. Sebastian, stiff and unconvincing, that Francisco de Zurbarán could not have spent much time on. In the same room are works of contemporary art. On the floor, as high as your ankle and refracting the Baroque works on the walls, is an abstract construction of mirrored triangular prisms by the Antwerp artists Stéphane Schraenen and Carla Arocha — another work that produces drama through reflected light. (It’s also a reminder that this show’s curator does not play by the rules: Ms. Arocha is Mr. Tuymans’s wife.) Image Caravaggio’s “Flagellation of Christ” is juxtaposed with an abstract construction of mirrored triangular prisms by Stéphane Schraenen and Carla Arocha in the exhibition “Sanguine/Bloedrood.”CreditM HKA The classic definition of the Baroque comes to us from the Swiss art historian Heinrich Wölfflin, whose “Principles of Art History” (1915) distinguished it from the earlier High Renaissance through a series of visual contrasts. Renaissance pictures are “linear,” each figure outlined and balanced within the picture plane; Baroque pictures are “painterly,” with figures melting into one another. The contrast isn’t without exceptions, but Wölfflin’s typology remains helpful: If Renaissance painting aimed to depict “the solid figure,” the art of the Baroque era favored “the changing appearance,” “movement” and “the form in function.” A small number of the contemporary works in this exhibition have that same dynamism and heightened visual contrast. One is “The Kiss,” a lovely wall-mounted sculpture of undulating red velvet and a black wooden triangle, made in 1984 by the excellent and still underappreciated Flemish artist Lili Dujourie. There are also several kitsch rehashes of historical motifs, including Nadia Naveau’s clownish plaster busts of Figaro or a curly-haired courtier (whose Rococo curls seem more 18th-century anyway). And stately black-and-white photographs of Brazilian Baroque sculptures by Marcel Gautherot, the French photographer better known for documenting the construction of Brasília, expand the show’s focus from Europe to colonies in the new world. Image “The Kiss,” (1984) is a wall-mounted sculpture of undulating red velvet and a black wooden triangle by the Flemish artist Lili Dujourie.CreditM HKA Image “Immolation I, II, III, IV,” by David Gheron Tretiakoff, a series of drawings burned by cigarettes into silk paper.CreditM HKA Yet the Baroque is as much a temperament as a style. It’s theatrical, and obsessed with death. It’s also profoundly Catholic — the Baroque era coincides with the Counter-Reformation, and artists here in Flanders relied on cash from the church or from patrons in Spain, which ruled the Catholic Netherlands, to produce these extravagant images. It’s this visceral character that seems to interest Mr. Tuymans most in Baroque art, and much of the most compelling contemporary work in “Sanguine/Bloedrood” echoes the 17th-century tradition in its excess and intensity, rather than in its appearance. For “In Flanders Fields” (2000) by Berlinde De Bruyckere, perhaps the only Belgian artist more lugubrious than Mr. Tuymans himself, the embalmed corpses of three horses, their hides patched and their eyes sewn shut, lie in morbid suspension. (As always with animals in Ms. De Bruyckere’s art, the horses died of natural causes.) In the most striking move of “Sanguine/Bloedrood,” on a wall in the same gallery are a clutch of On Kawara’s frosty “Date Paintings,” each carefully lettered with the day, month and year on which the Japanese-American artist made it. These archetypes of conceptual painting, accompanied, too, by Kawara’s nearly unknown early prints of atomic bomb victims, have never appeared more operatic and ghoulish than they do here. Image Berlinde De Bruyckere’s “In Flanders Fields,” made from the corpses of embalmed horses, is juxtaposed with “Date Paintings” by On Kawara.CreditM HKA Those two understandings of the Baroque, one visual, one emotional, collide in Edward Kienholz’s “Five Car Stud,” a walk-in sculptural tableau of harrowing violence that was one of the most controversial artworks of the 1970s, but that has been little seen since. This giant installation, staged in an inflatable dome in a parking lot near the Museum of Contemporary Art, comprises four cars and a pickup truck whose headlights illuminate life-size figures in the center of the room. The figures are white men, wearing ghoulish rubber masks, who stand over and prepare to castrate a black man — presumably for being seen with the white woman sitting in the pickup’s cabin, hiding her face in agony. Shown at the now-mythologized Documenta 5 of 1972, “Five Car Stud” spent the next four decades languishing in storage at a Japanese museum; it now belongs to the Fondazione Prada in Milan, where this show will go after its Antwerp run. Like Caravaggio’s “Flagellation,” its depiction of violence in chiaroscuro reaches Baroque heights of intensity and drama. Unlike in the Caravaggio, here that violence never resolves into beauty, and its actual-scale lynching grows only more disturbing the longer you look. And perhaps this is the real point of Mr. Tuymans’s peculiar exhibition, beyond the formal echoes of light and shadow across centuries: that the extremity of Antwerp’s old style serves all too naturally for art that aims to depict our present age. For Kienholz and for so many other artists here, the Baroque had become a kind of realism. “Sanguine/Bloedrood” Through Sept. 16 at the Museum of Contemporary Art (M HKA), Antwerp; muhka.be.

By Megan O’Grady Jan. 3, 2019 AT THE END OF THE CENTURY The Stories of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala 439 pp. Counterpoint. $26. Perhaps no author has made more art of dispossession than Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. The author of a dozen novels and twice as many screenplays — she’s the only person to have won both the Booker Prize (for her eighth and best-known novel, “Heat and Dust”) and an Academy Award (twice, for best adapted screenplay) — Jhabvala was 12 when she fled Nazi Germany with her family in 1939. After the war, when her father learned the fate of the relatives left behind, he killed himself. But even before her “disinheritance,” as she would later call these fundamental losses, Jhabvala was writing stories — first in German, and after they had settled in London, in English. She was studying English literature when she met Cyrus Jhabvala, an architect, and in 1951, they married and moved to Delhi. India was her home and subject until 1975, when she moved to New York’s Upper East Side, buying an apartment near her friends and creative partners, Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, as her career as a screenwriter flourished. There, as if closing a circle, she wrote fiction inspired by the European émigrés she met, people who understood what it meant to be homesick for a way of life that no longer existed. In a 1979 lecture, Jhabvala described herself as “blown about from country to country, culture to culture,” a “cuckoo forever insinuating itself into other’s nests.” In this country, she’s best known as the screenwriting talent behind so many Merchant-Ivory films, among them the sumptuous, Oscar-winning adaptations of E. M. Forster’s “A Room With a View” and “Howards End” (a film of her own novel “The Householder” was their first collaboration). Her name brings to mind Edwardian corset dresses and Julian Sands in a meltingly lit field of poppies — though her asperity and sense of moral stakes, so in tune with Forster’s, were the crisp counterpoint to all that romance. These weren’t merely costume dramas or comedies of manners, but struggles for the souls of women. Forster’s great subject, the pull of individual passions against stifling social conformity, the old order against the new — “the unlovely chaos that lies between obedience and freedom,” as he once put it — is also the through-line in Jhabvala’s wryly tender early stories and novels. Raising three daughters in Delhi, she was well situated to observe Indian society post-independence, with its Westernizing, marriage-minded middle class — and, at the same time, to apply her well-developed irony to the many European seekers of the 1960s she encountered, people for whom India was a semi-mythical destination, a warm, sensuous alternative to their own lumpen postwar continent, as it was for Jhabvala herself for a time. Her work anticipates a world of displaced people, where, as the half-British, half-Indian narrator of one of her stories puts it, everyone is “moving more freely” as “refugees or emigrants or just out of restless curiosity” and where there are “at least two generations of people in whom several kinds of heritage are combined.” A posthumous new collection of selected short fiction, “At the End of the Century: The Stories of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala,” showcases her darker cadences. The stories — all of them elegantly plotted and unsentimental, with an addictive, told-over-tea quality — are largely character studies of people isolated, often tragically, by custom or self-delusion. In “The Widow,” a woman in her prime, Durga, finds herself surrounded by grasping relatives following the death of her much older, impotent husband, who leaves her with a fine house and a sense that “somehow, somewhere, she has been shortchanged.” Disastrously, her dormant maternal feelings — mingling with erotic longings — are awakened by her tenant’s teenage son. “Expiation” movingly depicts a cloth merchant’s Job-like devotion to his prodigal younger brother, who rapes and murders an upper-class schoolboy, stealing his roller skates. In “Desecration,” a privileged young bride, Sofia, pursues a debasing affair with a thuggish local official. These vivid, unsparing portraits are leavened with the kind of humanizing moments that evoke a total world within their compression, as when the cloth merchant delivers last rites to his brother or when Sofia realizes that the person who knows her best is the chauffeur. In such moments, one feels very far from that poppy field. Image [ In 1983, Jhabvala told The Times about her first impressions of India: “It was paradise on earth. The sight of the sky, that vast sky, the light, the colors. I loved the heat, going around with few clothes, the stone floors.” ] In contrast, Jhabvala’s stories about Westerners, many of them blank young women who fall prey to burning-eyed gurus or other spiritual grifters, tend to blur. Their pursuit of borrowed meaning — “an Indian experience” — is styled as farce, the satire too on the nose: One wan disciple urges another to submit to “the beauty of surrender, of not having a will and not having thoughts of your own.” The authorial disdain is palpable, as is, perhaps, an echo of Jhabvala’s own outgrown illusions. When she does deviate slightly from this template, it can be tantalizing: In “Two More Under the Indian Sun,” a sympathetic young Englishwoman happily married to an Indian man pays a social call on her widowed older friend, a congenial busybody who staves off loneliness with meditation workshops, charitable causes and “holy men from the Himalayas.” One longs to revisit the younger woman, in whom one detects a germinating seed of ambivalence, in middle age. After two decades, Jhabvala felt ill at ease living in material comfort in India, describing her adopted country as “a great animal of poverty and backwardness,” and writing, in a rare autobiographical essay, of the mercurial intensity of her feelings for it — “I think of myself as strapped to a wheel that goes round and round and sometimes I’m up and sometimes I’m down.” Contemporary readers might wish for a memoir in this vein, a less oblique take. The closest she seems to have come was her 2004 story collection, “My Nine Lives: Chapters of a Possible Past,” which she describes as “alternative destinies” — one of which, “Ménage,” in which a writer looks back on a love triangle involving her mother and aunt, is included in this book. But Jhabvala thrived in the more densely screened confessional of fiction. If her stories have fallen slightly out of fashion, it may be in some part because of this resistance to the soul laid bare. Her characters have little interiority or agency; the fates they run up against tend to feel inexorable, especially in her later stories, in which the ironic distance cools into cynicism. Certain types — charlatans, wastrels and freeloaders, many of them Indian — accumulate troublingly, as does the kind of servant who pines for the good old days when they wore white gloves to serve dinner. Exploitation is a constant theme, and the psychopathology of power and domination: She seemed to have even less confidence than Forster in the possibility of true connection between colonizer and colonized. In later stories, after Jhabvala had moved to New York, the gurus morph into another type of charming fraud: the male creative “genius” surrounded by female acolytes. She would have had no end of material today. Jhabvala’s stories are also, of course, unfashionable for another reason: their unabashed ventriloquizing of another culture, an inhabiting of India and Indians that a contemporary author might take pains to artistically justify, all the more so now that our bookshelves are filled with Indian authors writing in English. But this is what surely gives Jhabvala’s work its rare gleam: the undeceived clarity of the eternal outsider, immersed yet apart. In the collection’s final story, “The Judge’s Will” — published in The New Yorker 10 days before her death — she returns to India with a setup worthy of Singer or Chekhov: A dying judge reveals to his wife his wish to provide for his mistress after his death. (In a move Jhabvala might have appreciated, the story is being transplanted to Chicago for a film written by James Ivory and directed by Alexander Payne.) In a few pages, Jhabvala executes a deft reversal of marital power, touching, along the way, on sex and class, duty and desire — and the surprise, across all barriers, of empathy.

arts 11 New Books We Recommend This Week - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|11 New Books We Recommend This Week Supported by Editors’ Choice 11 New Books We Recommend This Week Image Jan. 3, 2019 How better to enter the new year than with a look back? History runs through many of this week’s recommended titles, from the fall of Rome to the birth of Islam to Michelangelo in 16th-century Constantinople. If Paris in the 1960s is your bag, Patrick Modiano has you covered. If you’re interested in the Harlem Renaissance but have never read Jean Toomer’s seminal 1923 novel “Cane,” which helped catalyze that movement, you might add it to your list of resolutions. If you’re curious about the Philippine-American War and its lasting impact — inescapable in the Philippines, mostly ignored in America — then Gina Apostol’s novel “Insurrecto” offers an improbably fun, and funny, guide. (When you’re done with that, maybe pick up another satire out of Asia. Yan Lianke’s “The Day the Sun Died” or Gengoroh Tagame’s “My Brother’s Husband: Volume 2” both fit the bill.) We round things out with a debut novel about London and two books by notable critics: a memoir of love and reading late in life by the literary critic Susan Gubar, and a collection of film writing by the movie critic A. S. Hamrah. Happy 2019, everyone. Gregory Cowles Senior Editor, Books CANE, by Jean Toomer. (Penguin Classics, $15.) In 1923, Toomer published “Cane,” the single, slender novel upon which his reputation rests. In bursts of poetry and prose, it tells of black life in the lethal rural South and in the loveless cities of the North. “Cane” sold modestly but exerted a powerful influence over the Harlem Renaissance. “It is oracular, delirious and American,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes, “rich with the intensities of Melville, the expansiveness of Whitman and Toomer’s own bedeviling preoccupation with color.” THE EARTH DIES STREAMING: Film Writing, 2002-2018, by A. S. Hamrah. (n+1, $20.) As the resident movie critic of the literary and political journal n+1, Hamrah writes about his idiosyncratic favorites with a political awareness that never succumbs to leaden moralizing. Hamrah is “committed to his ambivalence,” our critic Jennifer Szalai says, “conveying it with a mixture of precision and conviction that will remind you how much more there is to be gleaned from a review than whether a movie is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ (even if it’s a movie you happen to deem very good or very bad indeed).” LATE-LIFE LOVE: A Memoir, by Susan Gubar. (Norton, $25.95.) The influential literary critic blends tales of her marriage, her cancer treatments and her husband’s age-related infirmities with discussions of works whose meaning has changed for her over time; her rereadings confirm her talents as a teacher. “There are moments when pain sears through,” John Sutherland writes in his review. “The universal physical awfulness of age is scrutinized … with the cold eye of a Jonathan Swift.” Nonetheless, he adds, “Gubar continues to defiantly flex her critical muscles.” MORTAL REPUBLIC: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny, by Edward J. Watts. (Basic, $32.) By the second century B.C., the proud Roman Republic had been brought low by inequity, corruption and populist politicians. Since America’s founders modeled it on the Roman example, Watts, a historian, warns that it behooves us to understand what went wrong over 2,000 years ago. “The bad news is that the coming decades are unlikely to afford us many moments of calm and tranquillity,” our reviewer, Yascha Mounk, writes. “If the central analogy that animates ‘Mortal Republic’ is correct, the current challenge to America’s political system is likely to persist long after its present occupant has left the White House.” MUHAMMAD: Prophet of Peace Amid the Clash of Empires, by Juan Cole. (Nation, $28.) Cole offers an ambitiously revisionist picture of the father of Islam, replacing the idea of a militant leader with one of a peacemaker who wanted only to preach his monotheism freely and even sought “multicultural” harmony. Writing in the Book Review, Mustafa Akyol calls it “eruditely informative” and says Cole is “demonstrably right in concluding that Islamic orthodoxy deviated from its foundations by ‘abrogating’ the peaceful and tolerant verses of the Quran.” INSURRECTO, by Gina Apostol. (Soho, $26.) Set in the Philippines, this novel raises provocative questions about history and hypocrisy as it follows two women with dueling modern-day film scripts about a colonial-era massacre. “Apostol has not only shredded the map and cast it out the window,” Jen McDonald writes in her review, “she has taken a grenade to the road and charted in its place a mind-bending, blazingly satirical course into a Philippines traumatized and forever altered by American arrogance and aggression.” MY BROTHER’S HUSBAND: Volume 2, by Gengoroh Tagame. Translated by Anne Ishii. (Pantheon, $25.95.) A sweet satire of Japan’s taboo against gay marriage, this manga-style graphic novel is a sophisticated investigation into the nature of love, marriage, divorce, bereavement and nontraditional child-rearing. “Small hints of the erotic edge onto the pages, particularly in Tagame’s detailed drawings of men’s (mostly clothed) bodies,” Hillary Chute writes in her latest graphics column, “but this careful, good-natured, family-friendly story offers something for everybody — kids and adults alike — even as it introduces real complexity around sex and gender expectations.” IN OUR MAD AND FURIOUS CITY, by Guy Gunaratne. (MCD/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper, $16.) This striking, Booker-longlisted debut unfolds over a few restless days in a working-class Northwest London suburb after a murder in the name of Islamic extremism (based on a true-life killing). Despite the rush of drama indicated by Gunaratne’s title, “his strengths are in the quieter details — of personal stories, nuanced characterizations and especially in his multivocal breadth of register,” our reviewer, Jon McGregor, writes. “Gunaratne has a gift for inhabiting the lives of his characters, and has used that gift here to give voice to Londoners who are not often seen in contemporary fiction.” THE DAY THE SUN DIED, by Yan Lianke. Translated by Carlos Rojas. (Grove, $26.) This brutal satirical novel takes place on a single night, when a plague of somnambulism unleashes a host of suppressed emotions among the inhabitants of a Chinese village. The ensuing chaos is promptly struck from the official record. Reviewing it, Julian Gewirtz calls it a “gripping novel” that “forces readers to reflect on the side of the world that is ‘too absurd, too cruel and too unpleasant.’ … Yan’s subject is China, but he has condensed the human forces driving today’s global upheavals into a bracing, universal vision.” TELL THEM OF BATTLES, KINGS, AND ELEPHANTS, by Mathias Énard. Translated by Charlotte Mandell. (New Directions, paper, $19.95.) In this intoxicating novel, set in 1506, Michelangelo sets up shop in Constantinople to design a bridge over the Golden Horn. Elisabeth Zerofsky, reviewing it alongside two other French novels, says that reading it “feels somehow radical in 2018, provoking a kind of wistfulness at the wonder and uncertainty that Michelangelo experiences in his confrontation with foreignness.” SLEEP OF MEMORY, by Patrick Modiano. Translated by Mark Polizzotti. (Yale, $24.) The Nobel laureate’s dreamlike novels summon elusive, half-forgotten episodes. Here, that means Paris in the ’60s, love affairs, a flirtation with the occult and a shocking crime. “Modiano owes much to Proust,” Elisabeth Zerofsky writes in her review, “though his postmodern drifting is far easier to read; there is warmth to be drawn from those unbidden memories, reminiscences of attending a strange party on a cold winter night many years ago conjuring not so much regret as simple pleasure.” Correction:  An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the terminal points of a bridge in the novel “Tell Them of Battles, Kings, and Elephants,” by Mathias Énard. Michelangelo designs the bridge to cross the Golden Horn in Constantinople; it is not “a bridge connecting Europe and Asia.” The same item misspelled the surname of the book’s translator; she is Charlotte Mandell, not Mandel.

Benny Blanco featuring Juice WRLD and Brendon Urie, ‘Roses’ Many threads of emo get woven together by the savvy pop producer Benny Blanco on the eerily effective “Roses,” from his new album “Friends Keep Secrets.” First comes Juice WRLD, the leading petulant emoter in hip-hop, his voice an exhausted peal: “Still feeling dead when I think about you/I can’t do a damn thing when I’m without you.” Then comes Brendon Urie — frontman for Panic! at the Disco — who arrives with an almost sensual, R&B take on heartbreak, groaning, “Every look you give it’s like I’m see-through.” This successful collaboration across generations and styles is a reminder that they were never that far apart to begin with. JON CARAMANICA Galactic featuring Miss Charm Taylor, ‘Clap Your Hands’ Here’s nothing more or less than a euphoric three-minute New Orleans funk romp from one of the city’s long-running bands: a backbeat, some bluesy harmonica, a rowdy horn section, a busy tambourine and Miss Charm Taylor sassily declaiming, “It’s something in the beat/that makes me feel so free.” No further explanation needed. JON PARELES Jacob Collier, ‘With the Love in My Heart’ A virtuoso singer and multi-instrumentalist, Jacob Collier raids musical tombs, yanking ideas from across the natural world. But he doesn’t stir everything into a chilled-out groove; instead he shines a bold light on every trick he uses, moving from reference to reference as if flipping tabs on a browser. This is beat-driven music that’s meant for headphone listening, not the dance floor. On “With the Love in My Heart,” you might catch a few direct references: to J Dilla-influenced jazz drumming, the wagging synths of 1980s funk (à la Zapp & Roger), high-school drumlines. The track comes from “Djesse, Vol. 1,” a new album he recorded with the Metropole Orkest. This is the first in a four-disc package that Collier plans to release, one album at a time, over the coming year. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Meek Mill, ‘Funk Flex #Freestyle118’ “Championships,” Meek Mill’s first full-length statement following his release from jail earlier this year, didn’t fully capture what makes him so invigorating as a rapper. He’s an orator, and anything that prevents him from talk-rapping — namely, the dictates of song construction, especially when it comes to working within a melodic framework — is a distraction. So it’s appropriate that the most vital Meek Mill moment of this cycle comes on this freestyle, part of Funkmaster Flex’s ongoing series. He begins with a stroke of comity, speaking about reconciling with Drake, and then exuberantly raps over “Back to Back,” the song Drake used to dismantle him so effectively three years ago: “My old opps, they super mad, we left them pouring Henny up/‘Cause they homies got whacked, we bought Maybachs/Came through they strip, no tint, laid back.” But it’s later in the 10-minute performance that Meek Mill’s talents truly shine through. He’s become something of a cautionary tale, and he wants to warn others. For about five minutes, much of it aimed directly to the camera, he raps about the futility of the drug game, about the hopelessness that leads to poor decisions. “They tried to bury us, ain’t know that we was seeds/We had to trap, ain’t get no toys on Christmas Eve/Play that corner made you rich, what we believed,” he raps, with understanding and exhaustion. And then he goes on, telling people that there’s another way. JON CARAMANICA Cactus Blossoms, ‘Please Don’t Call Me Crazy’ The sound is retro but the words are up-to-the-minute in “Please Don’t Call Me Crazy,” by the Cactus Blossoms, who have the vocal harmonies, reverb guitars and rockabilly backbeat of the Everly Brothers but live in the present. Singing over echoey guitars and a few chords, they confront digital life as lived now: “Computer in your pocket/Nobody has to know,” they sing. “What you want/not what you need.” PARELES ÌFÉ, ‘The Tearer (Bembe)’ ÌFÉ is a Puerto Rican electronic group led by a high priest of the Afro-Caribbean religion of Santería; a bembe is a drum-driven Santería ritual. But “The Tearer (Bembe)” is far from folkloric. The steady but ever-varying beat mixes percussion, piano, synthesizer and quick hisses of white noise behind rapping, singing and, about halfway through, an Auto-Tuned woman’s voice leading a traditional-sounding call-and-response. The song glances at current events as it praises Oya, “she who tears,” the Yoruba goddess of storms, winds and transformation; the video presents her Marvel Comics equivalent, Storm of the X-Men. But what makes the track compelling is the beat. PARELES Holly Herndon and Jlin featuring Spawn, ‘Godmother’ Holly Herndon is an electronic composer who often uses her speaking and singing voice; Jlin is a producer and D.J. who has pushed the skittish momentum of Chicago’s footwork into even more hectic abstractions. “Godmother” was generated without editing by Spawn, an artificial-intelligence device that was trained on Herndon’s voice and Jlin’s tracks. It unleashes Herndon’s vocal syllables as percussion for a kind of hissy, feminine, multilayered, glitchy beatboxing, human input dispensed with inhuman timing. PARELES Eddie Palmieri, ‘Quimbombo’ After the death of his wife, Iraida, Eddie Palmieri found himself revisiting the songs they had shared in their youth. Eventually, it led the Latin music eminence into his next project: “Mi Luz Mayor,” an agile record featuring big-band arrangements of old Afro-Caribbean dance numbers and boleros. At the center is Palmieri’s scathing piano. On “Quimbombo” — originally recorded by Willie Colón and Hector Lavoe — the vocalist Herman Olivera volleys with his backing chorus in a gleeful paean to okra stew. The vocalists and orchestra offer a sunnier, smoother take than the original recording (closer to the Hermanos Moreno version), but Palmieri has another thing in mind. His piano teases against Olivera’s vocals with subtle displacements until he finally breaks into a full-on solo, laying waste to the song’s simple four-chord pattern. RUSSONELLO Toby Keith, ‘Don’t Let the Old Man In’ Of course late-career Toby Keith would find poignancy at the intersection of deflated bluster and a stubborn clinging to the past. “Don’t Let the Old Man In” is from the new Clint Eastwood film “The Mule,” about an older military veteran turned drug carrier. Keith’s song is slow, grounded, with an air of tragedy that gives way to defiance. CARAMANICA Mark Stewart and the Maffia, ‘Liberty City’ “Liberty City” was on the 1983 debut album by Mark Stewart and Maffia, a post-punk band that topped funk and dub-reggae vamps with atonal spoke-sung vocals, noise and free-jazz horns. Its lyrics still apply 35 years later, in an era of hypercapitalism — “Struggling to pay the rent/The main worry’s job security/The busier you are the less you see” — and in this new video, Mehmet Sander’s choreography groups a team of dancers to punish themselves on a Sisyphusean slope.

His students have gone on to solo careers and to prominent positions in ensembles, orchestras and conservatories.CreditCreditRob Bennett for The New York Times By Anthony Tommasini Jan. 1, 2019 Aldo Parisot, a renowned cellist who toured the world as a soloist and settled into a career as an eminent teacher that included a 60-year tenure at the Yale School of Music, died on Saturday at his home in Guilford, Conn. He was 100. His death was announced by his son, Dean Parisot, a film director and producer in Los Angeles. The cellist had retired from Yale only last June. During the busiest stage of his solo career Mr. Parisot performed with the major orchestras of Berlin, London, Paris and Munich, and with conductors including Leopold Stokowski, Pierre Monteux and Leonard Bernstein, winning plaudits for his warm, focused sound; prodigious technique; and a temperament that balanced passion and elegance. For a 1955 New York Philharmonic appearance under the conductor Walter Hendl, he gave the premiere of Heitor Villa-Lobos’s Cello Concerto No. 2, one of many works Mr. Parisot would commission during his career to expand the cello repertory. But by his 30s he had started teaching. He held positions at the Peabody Conservatory (now part of Johns Hopkins University), Mannes College of Music and elsewhere before joining the faculty at Yale in 1958. Image Mr. Parisot in 1952. Many Parisot students have gone on to solo careers and to prominent positions in ensembles, orchestras and conservatories. They include Roman Jablonski, Ole Akahoshi and Shauna Rolston. Carter Brey, the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic, who studied with Mr. Parisot at Yale in the late 1970s, shared his memories in an email. Mr. Parisot’s teaching style “was not based on the transmission of a grand, overarching view of music,” Mr. Brey wrote. “Neither was it greatly concerned with historical detail. It was practical, reactive and prescriptive.” Being part of his class was like attending “the highest-level finishing school imaginable,” Mr. Brey wrote, “none of us sounding like anyone else, and above all none of us sounding like him.” Aldo Simões Parisot was born on Sept. 30, 1918, in Natal, Brazil. His mother was a church organist. His father, an engineer, died when Aldo was 4. His stepfather, Thomazzo Babini, a fine cellist, was his first and only significant cello teacher. “Everything I know and teach today comes from him,” Mr. Parisot said of his stepfather in 2001. At 18 he became the principal cellist of the orchestra in Rio de Janeiro. Still, he was restless for a solo career. The attaché to the American Embassy, impressed by Mr. Parisot, helped arrange for him to study at the Curtis Institute of Music with his idol, the great cellist Emanuel Feuermann. But Feuermann died in 1942 three months before Mr. Parisot was to start lessons. (He would later acquire a Stradivarius cello that had belonged to Feuermann.) In 1946, Mr. Parisot became a scholarship student at the Yale School of Music, but with a stipulation that he would take no cello lessons: He already felt confident of his technique and approach. Instead he studied chamber music and, with the composer Paul Hindemith, music theory. In 1948 he joined the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra but left after two years. A 1950 recital at Town Hall in New York drew wide praise and led to international tours and recordings. Notable Deaths 2018: Music A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 He had a major success in 1966 at Tanglewood when he gave the premiere of Donald Martino’s “Parisonatina al’dodecafonia,” a formidable work for solo cello written for him. Reviewing the performance, The New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg, who in general resisted thorny modern music employing 12-tone techniques, was enthusiastic about Martino’s “whizbang virtuoso piece in the modern idiom,” as he called it. Probably as “difficult a work as ever has been written for the cello,” Mr. Schonberg wrote, the piece “throws at the performer everything in the book and a few things that aren’t.” But, he added, in an “extraordinary performance,” Mr. Parisot “accomplished everything with an easy, almost bored expression,” and “his tone and intonation never betrayed him.” Besides the lure of teaching, Mr. Parisot curtailed his solo career to spend more time with his family. He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Elizabeth (Sawyer) Parisot, a pianist and professor at the Yale School of Music; his three sons from a previous marriage to Ellen (Lewis) Parisot, Dean, Robert and Ricardo; a half brother, Italo Babini, a cellist; and six grandchildren. Another student, the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, wrote in a 2009 New York Times appreciation that Mr. Parisot’s “directness and impulsive statements, uncensored by political correctness,” sometimes “ruffled feathers.” But his teacher radiated warmth, charm and impish humor, Mr. Kirshbaum wrote. The article quotes the famous cellist and pedagogue Janos Starker describing Mr. Parisot as “the best cello teacher I have met in my life.” In 1983, Mr. Parisot founded Yale Cellos, an ensemble of 20 or so cellists who play everything from arrangements of Bach to contemporary scores. Though the group’s overall sound is deep and rich, Mr. Parisot, as conductor, drew remarkable clarity and nuance from the ensemble, which toured and recorded, including a Delos CD “Bach Bachianas” that earned a 1988 Grammy nomination. Long ago Mr. Parisot started proclaiming that he was 60 years old and would remain 60 until he died. “The secret to staying young,” he was quoted as saying in the 2009 Times article, “is to surround yourself with the younger generation. It is boring to talk to the elderly about their blood pressure and cholesterol levels.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Aldo Parisot, Esteemed Cellist Who Taught at Yale for 60 Years, Dies at 100.

One of the simplest, yet most stressful, decisions I deal with on a regular basis is one I’m sure you have worried over, too: What’s for dinner? There have been nights when I’ve stared at my phone, endlessly scrolling through Seamless in search of the perfect meal, and next thing I know I’ve wasted half an hour and I’m still hungry and foodless. Sound familiar? Enter F.O.B.O.: Fear of Better Options. And it’s a thing. Researchers call this phenomenon maximization. It’s the relentless researching of all possible options for fear that you’ll miss out on the “best” one, leading to indecision, regret and even lower levels of happiness. The problem with maximizing is paradoxical: Though maximizers tend to make better decisions, they are less satisfied with those decisions than are people who make quicker ones based on less research (those people are called satisficers). And the ultimate goal of maximizing is impossible: You’ll never be able to examine every possible option before making a decision. To wit: One study found that maximizer college graduates chose jobs with higher starting salaries than did satisficers, but the maximizers were less satisfied because they felt regret and second-guessed their decisions, fearing there was still a better option out there. So how do we stop these endless maximization spirals that prevent us from making decisions? The solution falls somewhere between going full maximizers and becoming too much of a satisficer. Enter the Mostly Fine Decision. (Patent pending.) Your M.F.D. is the minimum outcome you’re willing to accept for a decision. It’s the outcome you’d be fine with, even if it’s not the absolute best possibility. So let’s say you’re me, sitting at home and 20 minutes into mindlessly scrolling through Seamless. To break the cycle and find my M.F.D. so I can actually make an order, I need to think about what my criteria are for a decision I’d be fine with: not hungry anymore, didn’t spend too much money, ate something I didn’t hate. With those criteria in mind, I now have a specific threshold I know I need to hit. Once I’ve found an option that ticks off all those boxes, I’ve landed on my M.F.D. And, just for the record: It was sushi, and it was fine. What’s a decision you just haven’t been able to make? Tell me on Twitter @timherrera or email me at tim@nytimes.com and tell me your M.F.D.

Tip of the Week This week I’ve invited Lisa Rabasca Roepe, a writer in Washington, D.C., to tell us all why we should probably tidy up our desk this week. If you’re like most people, your desk is littered with papers, tchotchkes and file folders. But a cluttered desk can undermine our ability to solve a difficult task, according to a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research. Students working at a tidy desk were willing to spend nearly 7.5 more minutes trying to solve a puzzle compared with students working at a cluttered desk. “You should only have the things you use every day on your desk,” said Donna Smallin, an organizing expert and author of “Clear the Clutter, Find Happiness: One-Minute Tips for Decluttering and Refreshing Your Home and Your Life.” Everything else should be stored somewhere else, she said: a desk drawer for items you use every day, a shelf for reference materials, a cabinet for files and supplies. The easiest way to tackle that pile of papers in the corner of your desk, according to Ms. Smallin, is to flip it over and start at the bottom, because those papers are outdated and it will be easier to release them. Not sure whether to keep it? If you don’t need it for legal or financial reasons, toss it, Ms. Smallin said. And if you must keep it, scan it. Our friends at Wirecutter — a New York Times company — recommend the smartphone app Scanbot for all your scanning needs.

By Sean Wilentz Jan. 2, 2019 THE WAR BEFORE THE WAR Fugitive Slaves and the Struggle for America’s Soul From the Revolution to the Civil War By Andrew Delbanco Illustrated. 453 pp. Penguin Press. $30. The Civil War began over one basic issue: Was slavery, the ownership of human beings, a legitimate national institution, fixed in national law by the United States Constitution? One half of the country said it was, the other said it was not. The ensuing conflict was the chief instigator of Southern secession, as the secessionists themselves proclaimed. It was thus the chief source of the war that led to slavery’s abolition in the United States. The struggle over property in slaves focused largely on the fate of the Western territories, but it also inflamed conflicts over the status of fugitive slaves. Pro-slavery Southerners insisted that the federal government was obliged to capture slaves who had escaped to free states and return them to their masters, and thus vindicate the masters’ absolute property rights in humans. Antislavery Northerners, denying that obligation and those supposed rights, saw the fugitives as heroic refugees from bondage, and resisted federal interference fiercely and sometimes violently. Even more than the fights over the territories, Andrew Delbanco asserts in “The War Before the War,” the “dispute over fugitive slaves … launched the final acceleration of sectional estrangement.” Delbanco, an eminent and prolific scholar of American literature, is well suited to recounting this history, and not just because fugitive slaves have been a subject of American fiction from Harriet Beecher Stowe to Toni Morrison and beyond. A traditional critic in the historicist mode, Delbanco has always thoughtfully rendered the contexts in which his writers wrote. He has offered fresh interpretations not only of how national politics shaped the writing of, say, “Moby-Dick,” but also of what Melville’s tragic awareness and moral ambiguities tell us about the temper of a nation hurtling toward civil war. Whitman, Emerson, Thoreau and Hawthorne, as well as Melville, Stowe and numerous lesser artists and thinkers of the time, all had pertinent if sometimes cursory and not always pleasing things to say about fugitive slaves. Delbanco’s incisive analyses of their observations — and, just as important, of their failure to observe — form one of his book’s running themes. Delbanco’s skills as a literary critic also illuminate the contributions fugitive slaves made to the growing antislavery movement. Although the number of fugitives was relatively small — according to an 1850 survey, only about 1,000 per year reached the North — they disproportionally aggravated the sectional divide. In part, Delbanco argues, the runaways were a continuing symbolic insult to the slaveholders’ honor, as their flight contradicted Southern claims that slavery was a benevolent, paternalist institution. (He might have added that the fugitive slave issue became an effective and distracting wedge for pro-slavery extremists, who deployed it to appeal to conservative Northerners by provoking antislavery radicals to violent paroxysms while playing the victim themselves.) More important, scores of fugitive slaves either wrote or dictated their personal experiences in widely read narratives, most famously the “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,” which awakened Northern whites to the enormity of Southern slavery. Image To his credit, Delbanco does not inflate the literary merits of the slave narratives. Often filtered through the sensibilities of collaborating abolitionists, they amounted, Delbanco writes, to “more than propaganda and less than literature.” (Douglass’s narrative was an exception and two or three others were at least partial exceptions.) But there is no denying the sensation they caused amid the political emergencies of the 1840s and 1850s, “giving voice to people long silenced,” and assailing the pro-slavery propaganda that sustained Northern white complacency. Delbanco’s literary judgments aside, “The War Before the War” is mainly a straightforward account of events that, although familiar to professional historians, ought to be known by anyone who claims to know anything about American history. In 1787, Southern delegates to the federal Constitutional Convention obtained a fugitive slave clause that called for (albeit vaguely) the capture and return of successful runaways. Over the following six decades, persistent slave escapes tested the ramshackle machinery put in place to halt them. In time, alarmed but emboldened Northern free blacks and their white abolitionist allies formed vigilance committees to ward off slavecatchers, while Northern legislatures began approving so-called personal liberty laws to shield the fugitives. In 1850, responding to slaveholders’ outcries, Congress passed a Fugitive Slave Act that strengthened the federal mandate for arresting and returning escapees. In a series of shocking confrontations, antislavery Northerners intervened, either to prevent the capture of fugitives or liberate those already in custody. The uproar of these pitched battles — Delbanco’s war before the war — helped turn Northern moderates into abolitionists and temperate Southerners into fire-eaters; at its height in 1854, it prompted President Franklin Pierce to order 1,500 federal troops to escort a single fugitive in Boston named Anthony Burns back into slavery in Virginia. Enforcing the fugitive slave law put the federal government emphatically on the side of slavery over freedom, which hastened the collapse of the national political system, the rise of the antislavery Republican Party and the coming of the war. Delbanco aims to balance his antislavery allegiances with caution about the smugness that can come with historical hindsight. In some of his earlier writings, this wariness has led him, by my taste, to be a little too charitable to revisionist interpretations that present the Civil War as a product of political failure, a catastrophe, instigated by malcontents, that a more responsible national leadership could have prevented. This view has arisen from an admixture of pacifism and an insistence on diminishing the moral as well as political disaster of slavery; and it has sometimes led its advocates to demonize the abolitionists as the chief fomenters of an unnecessary war. As Delbanco admires the abolitionists, and slights slavery’s terrors not at all, his occasional revisionist musings seem to stem from his horror at the military slaughterhouse, his wonder at whether it could have been avoided and his wariness of sanctimony, including Yankee sanctimony. In this book, though, Delbanco sticks to viewing the war as the ghastly but necessary price for abolishing slavery — what Abraham Lincoln described in his Second Inaugural Address as cruel justice meted out by the Almighty. Delbanco now dispels sanctimony differently, by reviving forgotten figures such as the St. Louis minister and educator William Greenleaf Eliot — not coincidentally, T. S. Eliot’s grandfather — who hated slavery but tolerated the fugitive slave law and, until the bitter end, held out hopes for a conciliatory gradual emancipation. History usually plows such people under as equivocators and worse. Delbanco restores to them their moral seriousness in brutally uncertain times. Over all, Delbanco’s account is accurate as well as vivid (although I wish he hadn’t garbled the details of the adoption of the fugitive slave clause in 1787, the book’s most serious lapse). He makes a strong case for the centrality of the fugitive slaves to the sectional crisis; indeed, by emphasizing the symbolism of the issue, he may have slighted the importance of its political and legal aspects. Without question, he has once again written a valuable book, reflective as well as jarring, concerning the most violent and enduring conflict in American history. Sean Wilentz teaches at Princeton. His latest book, “No Property in Man: Slavery and Antislavery at the Nation’s Founding,” was published in September.

Their string of hits began in 1975 with “Love Will Keep Us Together.”CreditCreditFin Costello/Redferns, via Getty Images By Neil Genzlinger Jan. 2, 2019 Daryl Dragon, the “Captain” half of the pop duo the Captain and Tennille, whose string of soft-rock hits in the 1970s included “Love Will Keep Us Together” and “Muskrat Love,” died on Wednesday in Prescott, Ariz. He was 76. His former wife and singing partner, Toni Tennille, announced his death through a publicist, who said the cause was renal failure. The Captain and Tennille, whose specialty was romantic ballads featuring Ms. Tennille’s silky voice, reached the Top 10 seven times from 1975 to 1979. “He was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly,” Ms. Tennille said in a statement. “I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him.” Mr. Dragon’s stage name came from his days as a backup musician with the Beach Boys in the 1960s and early ’70s, when he often wore a captain’s hat onstage. Mike Love, one of the group’s leaders, would introduce him to audiences as the “captain of the keyboards.” Image Mr. Dragon and Ms. Tennille in a 1978 photo publicizing a variety special on ABC. Their weekly variety series on the same network two years earlier was short-lived.CreditABC He had been performing with the Beach Boys for several years before the hat made its fateful appearance. “I just picked it up one night on the spur of the moment,” he told The Boston Globe in 1976, “and that night they spotlighted me in ‘Help Me Rhonda.’ It made a big hit, and I’ve been wearing it ever since.” Daryl Dragon was born on Aug. 27, 1942, in Los Angeles. His father, Carmen, was a composer and conductor, and his mother, Eloise (Rawitzer) Dragon, was a soprano who sang on radio programs. Mr. Dragon was trained in classical piano but didn’t take to it. “I seemed to be at war with myself in my musical tastes,” he told The Globe. “I could appreciate the great compositions, but I also liked the boogie beat.” He played in several bands in the 1960s before signing on with the Beach Boys. He met Ms. Tennille in 1971, when he was brought in to play keyboards for the San Francisco run of an ecology-themed musical, “Mother Earth,” which she had co-written and in which she was performing with South Coast Repertory, a theater company from Orange County, Calif. He in turn brought her onto a Beach Boys tour as a backup singer and pianist. The two began performing together in nightclubs, and after self-financing a demo, they landed a record contract. Their cover of “Love Will Keep Us Together,” a song that Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield wrote and that Mr. Sedaka recorded in 1973, became a worldwide hit in 1975, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart and winning the Grammy Award for record of the year. Notable Deaths 2018: Music A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 The Captain and Tennille kept turning out hits for the rest of the 1970s. They also landed a television variety show on ABC as the network tried to duplicate the success that Sonny and Cher had enjoyed with their own show earlier in the decade. But the series, which had its premiere in September 1976, lasted only one season. Mr. Dragon found the whole experience distasteful. “Television is a great garbage disposal,” he said at the time. “It keeps grinding up artists like us and throwing them away.” Mr. Dragon produced all 10 of the duo’s 10 albums. They continued to perform after their hit-making run ended in 1979 — “Do That to Me One More Time” was their last gold record — and Mr. Dragon produced other artists. Ms. Tennille, meanwhile, increasingly pursued solo projects. The couple divorced in 2014. In 2016, Ms. Tennille published a memoir in which she wrote that their marriage had not been the idyllic partnership it had been made to seem. Their record company, she wrote, falsely announced that they had married on Valentine’s Day 1975; to satisfy expectations, they married for real not long after. “I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,” she wrote. Mr. Dragon is survived by a brother, Doug.

But jazz’s increasing role as a commodity of intellectual cool brings its own set of questions. What is the effect of pop culture’s embrace of figures like Kamasi Washington, Esperanza Spalding and an entire generation of British jazz upstarts? That’s one theme of this episode, which also addresses the living legacy of Wayne Shorter, the renewed growth of big-band orchestras, and how jazz institutions, particularly in the academy, are shaping the genre’s future while selecting which parts of its past to prioritize.

Bunt/Getty Images By Neil Genzlinger Jan. 4, 2019 Dean Ford, vocalist for the Scottish band the Marmalade, whose voice was heard around the world on the group’s biggest hit, “Reflections of My Life,” died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 72. His daughter, Tracey McAleese Gorman, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Ford had a heady decade in the 1960s and early ’70s as the Marmalade (which eventually dropped its “the”) had hits in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, then grew even bigger with “Reflections,” a somber ballad in which the singer examines the world around him with dismay but also a glimmer of something positive. “The world is a bad place, a bad place, a terrible place to live,” sang Mr. Ford, who wrote “Reflections” with his bandmate Junior Campbell. “Oh, but I don’t want to die.” The song reached Billboard’s Top 10 in May 1970 after achieving even greater success in Britain. Fame, though, proved hard to handle for Mr. Ford, who left the group in the mid-1970s and struggled with alcoholism. In 1986 he sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous. One of his subsequent jobs was driving a limousine in Los Angeles, and his passengers included celebrities like Jane Wyman, Michael Jackson and Bob Dylan. But, he told The Scottish Mail in 2015, he never told passengers that he was once a celebrity too. “You’re not supposed to do that when you’re driving,” he said. “They don’t want to hear it. If it gets back to the guy who owns the company, you’re gone.” Mr. Ford, though, never lost his desire to perform. A subdued version of “Reflections of My Life” recorded in 2014 has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. Last year Mr. Ford released “This Scottish Heart,” a 30-track, two-disc album. “Music was his life, music inspired him, music was everything to him,” his daughter said in a telephone interview. “He wasn’t just a lead singer; he loved playing the guitar, and he played it to my son, and at family gatherings, barbecues. He wouldn’t go anywhere without it.” Notable Deaths 2018: Music A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 Dean Ford was his stage name. He was born Thomas McAleese on Sept. 5, 1946, in Airdrie, Scotland, to Thomas and Elizabeth McAleese. He grew up in neighboring Coatbridge and left school at 16 to join a band called the Cravats. In 1963 he was recruited to front another band, the Gaylords, but decided his name needed sprucing up. “I thought about Dean Martin and Tennessee Ernie Ford,” he told The Mail, “and put them together.” The group became Dean Ford and the Gaylords. Known for close harmonies, the band, renamed the Marmalade at the suggestion of its record company, had modest success in 1967 with “I See the Rain,” then hit it big the next year with a cover of the Beatles’ “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” that went to the top of the British charts. The group toured with the Who and other leading acts of the day, immersed in the wild side of rock ’n’ roll. Mr. Ford said he avoided drugs for the most part but was derailed by alcohol. He had married Janeanne McBaine in 1968, but the marriage broke up. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Liz Carson. After leaving Marmalade, Mr. Ford also left Britain for the United States. “I wanted to start over,” he said in a 1998 interview. “I wanted a new life. The trouble was, I brought myself with me.” At one of his favorite watering holes, another regular was a woman who often arrived at the bar beaten and bloody. One day she stopped coming, and he assumed the worst. “But then she turned up, and the change in her was stunning,” he said. She told her old drinking partners that she had gone to A.A. for help. “I think God sends us a message when we’re ready to hear it,” Mr. Ford said. “I was ready to hear it then.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Dean Ford, 72, Vocalist for the Marmalade.

I Wear Art’ Supported by ‘I Don’t Wear Jewelry. I Wear Art’ Image Diane Venet, who collects not only paintings and sculptures but also jewelry by artists, wearing earrings by Lee Ufan at her apartment in Paris.CreditCreditDmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times By Laura Rysman Dec. 1, 2017 PARIS — Above the galleries and shops that line the Right Bank streets south of the Seine, the comfortable class of the French capital live with their wealth and their treasures. But it is still a shock to walk into an apartment and find a framed Cy Twombly propped against the wall and a Donald Judd sculpture standing alongside on the parquet floor. “I like to be surrounded,” Diane Venet said of her art collection as she left the room. From under her bed, she fished out a crate stocked with art of another form. Ms. Venet collects not just paintings and sculptures but also jewelry by artists, an unusual niche that will be the subject of a sprawling exhibition scheduled to open March 8 at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs here. With more than 200 pieces in her private collection, Ms. Venet has become an eminent proponent and patron of the form. Museums in cities like New York, Venice and Athens — and now Riga, Lativa — have held exhibitions of her wearable artworks, but the Paris display will be the largest and most visible yet, with the majority of her own collection on view alongside loans and pieces owned by the museum. Image A ring by Bernar Venet, a conceptual artist and Ms. Venet’s husband.CreditDmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times From her under-the-bed chest of jewels, Ms. Venet pulled out a brooch by Fernand Léger, a champlevé enameled version of his abstract, primary-toned canvases in gleaming miniature form. From a leather box, she withdrew a necklace by the Greek sculptor Panagiotis Vassilakis, known as Takis — one of his signature magnets floating toward a gold pendant molded from his lover’s most intimate area. “I don’t wear jewelry. I wear art,” Ms. Venet said, holding the necklace to her collarbone. “It’s a completely different thing.” Whether made in brass or the precious gold and platinum of traditional jewelry, such pieces defy the form’s established rules of beauty, deriving their worth not from costly materials but from the cultural value of the concept and reputation of its creator, like art itself. “You have to recognize the artist’s work in the jewel,” said Ms. Venet, who often collaborates with artists to help them translate their ideas into jewelry. “It doesn’t have to look like jewelry. I’m not asking you to be a jeweler. I’m not asking you to do small what you normally do big, but to take the concept of your work into another medium.” Image A necklace by Roberto Matta, a Surrealist and early promoter of Abstract Expressionism.CreditDmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times Other pieces in her collection come from auctions, or from a handful of gallery owners like Elisabetta Cipriani in London and her daughter Esther de Beaucé, who opened Galerie MiniMasterpiece in Paris in 2012. Ms. Venet’s collection is full of pieces that counter classical jewelry styles. A Yayoi Kusama necklace has soft wool shafts, mirroring the phallus-like appendages that blanket so many of her sculptures; a Damien Hirst bracelet dangles sinister pills rather than charms, and a Louise Bourgeois collar with a rhinestone leash echoes her explorations of female servitude. There is also a Jenny Holzer snake ring emblazoned with the artist’s capital-lettered meditations on death, a Lucio Fontana piece that presents his canvas-piercing Spatialism as a red enamel signet, and a Mylar balloon rabbit by Jeff Koons rendered as a platinum pendant. Pablo Picasso, Anish Kapoor, Nam June Paik, Giorgio de Chirico, Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, Hans Arp, Giacomo Balla, George Braque, Kiki Smith and many, many more artists whose experiments with jewelry have been largely unknown. Ms. Venet, a former TV and radio journalist from a family of art collectors, is married to the sculptor Bernar Venet, an acclaimed conceptual artist who is among the few artists invited to exhibit at the Palace of Versailles. In 1985, he wrapped a bar of silver around her finger and called the spontaneous sculpture an engagement ring, her first piece of artist’s jewelry. Image A gold pendant by Max Ernst is one of the more than 200 pieces in Ms. Venet’s private collection.CreditDmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times “I never liked stones — too impersonal,” Ms. Venet said. “Every young girl dreams of having an engagement ring with a diamond, like in advertising, but diamonds are just a question of money.” Big or little, she added, “they’re all the same, but art is something truly special.” In 2014 the couple established the Venet Foundation in a vast 18th-century mill near St.-Tropez, showing Mr. Venet’s work alongside creations by the likes of James Turrell, Robert Morris and Frank Stella, a close friend who made several jewels reminiscent of his shaped canvases for Ms. Venet over the years, rendering them as 3-D computer designs to be cast by a foundry. Few artists have managed to tackle the highly technical work of fabricating jewelry themselves. The best known and certainly most prolific was Alexander Calder, who included more than 1,800 pieces of jewelry among his mobiles and sculptures. Another artist jeweler, Arnaldo Pomodoro, is now considered Italy’s most consequential living sculptor but began his career making jewels of tiny “indecipherable symbols, like something so archaic that we’ve lost the code to the writing system,” he said last year as Milan was introducing a citywide retrospective of his work. Mr. Pomodoro learned the goldsmith’s craft from his hometown’s artisans before he began casting equally cryptic but massively monolithic sculptures. He continued to produce some jewelry, including a necklace that Ms. Venet now owns, yet said, “Jewelry is an ornament for the human body, but sculpture is something greater, it resonates with something larger.” Image The “Venin” necklace by Claude Lévêque.CreditDmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times So why would artists bother to make jewelry? Giancarlo Montebello runs the Milan-based GEM Montebello, perhaps the most notable workshop in the 1960s and ’70s for the creation of artists’ jewelry. He collaborated with Mr. Pomodoro (for a while, his brother-in-law) as well as artists like Mr. Fontana, Sonia Delaunay, Niki de Saint Phalle and almost 40 others. “It’s another way for artists to spread their visions,” Mr. Montebello said, linking the desire for creation to a freewheeling, experimental culture during what he called those “years of revolt.” “Jewelry represented an open vision of art,” he said. “It wasn’t codified, it wasn’t institutional, it wasn’t all about money — just exploration.” For the exhibition, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs will recreate Mr. Montebello’s studio (and that of a few others who produced artist’s jewelry), alongside many jewels from Ms. Venet’s collection that the atelier fabricated. The show’s curator, Karine Lacquemant, said she saw the show as a step beyond previous exhibitions of Ms. Venet’s jewelry, as it will pair pieces with paintings, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics and more from the museum’s collection to, as she described it, “cancel hierarchies” — creating a show that will display “the infinitesimal joined with the infinitely big.” In context with the other artworks, the jewelry, no longer about its material worth, will be valued for revealing the artists’ mind. “It’s art in miniature,” Ms. Venet said. “Art with a capital A.” Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and Instagram.

And Jennifer Aniston and Danielle Macdonald play mother and daughter in “Dumplin’.” What’s on TV COUNTERPART 9 p.m. on Starz. When this multidimensional thriller debuted about a year ago, the Times critic Mike Hale called it “the most entertaining new series of the winter.” J.K. Simmons stars as two versions of the same character. One is a low-level worker with the United Nations in Berlin. The other, living in a parallel dimension spun off from the real world 30 years earlier, is a coldblooded spy. The first season ended with the two versions of the characters each getting stuck in the other’s dimension. The second season, debuting Sunday night, picks up the story from there, allowing Simmons more time to delve into the nuances of this challenging double role. “I considered all kinds of subtle things in terms of appearance that ultimately seemed unnecessary,” the actor told The Times earlier this year. “Because the more interesting thing was how has a person really changed at his core in the second 30 years of his life due to his environment, his experiences.” What’s Streaming Image Danielle Macdonald, left, and Jennifer Aniston in “Dumplin’.”CreditBob Mahoney/Netflix DUMPLIN’ (2018) on Netflix. A 2015 young-adult novel by Julie Murphy provides the basis for this film, whose title comes from the nickname that its central character is given by her mother. That mother, played by Jennifer Aniston, is a former beauty queen in a small Texas town. Her daughter, Willowdean (Danielle Macdonald), fed up with her mother’s expectations regarding her weight, decides to enter the local beauty pageant (which happens to be run by her mother). “Macdonald was sensational in the under-loved indie comedy ‘Patti Cake$,’ and she easily holds the screen here, too, even when working on fumes and with dumb shtick,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. She added that the cast at large will “keep you hopeful even when the storytelling grinds to a crawl, which happens frequently.” Image Rohan ChandCreditNetflix MOWGLI: LEGEND OF THE JUNGLE (2018) on Netflix. The actor Andy Serkis is known for bringing uncommon life to motion-capture characters like Gollum in Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” films and Caesar in the recent “Planet of the Apes” movies. He took a turn directing with this blood-soaked adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s “The Jungle Book” stories. Its title character, Mowgli (Rohan Chand), is raised among wild animals. Through motion-capture, Christian Bale plays a panther; Benedict Cumberbatch is a tiger; and Cate Blanchett plays a python. “The filmmakers are clearly trying to bring an uncommon maturity to the fantasy film,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times. “And in many respects they succeed.” THE BOY AND THE BEAST (2015) on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. Like Mowgli, the protagonist of this anime fantasy is also surrounded by creatures. The film follows Ren, a young Japanese orphan who finds a portal to a world filled with humanoid animals.

arts Letters to the Editor - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Letters to the Editor Supported by Letters to the Editor Dec. 7, 2018 Lamentations To the Editor: In his review of five new books on Judaism (“Lamentations,” Nov. 18), Gal Beckerman movingly described the plight of contemporary American Judaism, with its spiritual void, sky-high intermarriage rate and lack of reverence on the part of most Jews. Yet I wish he had discussed the very different experiences of Orthodox Jews, for whom Judaism is often a living, dynamic and profoundly challenging and elevating experience. Instead, he dismisses Orthodox Judaism as something exotic and closed, and chooses to concentrate on “the 90 percent who are not Orthodox.” This diminishes his otherwise excellent essay. To a member of that Orthodox 10 percent, his choice is jarring. For one thing, Orthodoxy is growing rapidly. Fifteen percent of American Jews aged 28 to 45 identify as Orthodox and 27 percent of American Jewish children are being raised in Orthodox homes. Orthodox Jews are following a dynamic and relevant religion. I wish Beckerman had included us in his conversation. YVETTE ALT MILLER SKOKIE, ILL. The writer is the author of “Angels at the Table: A Practical Guide to Celebrating Shabbat.” ♦ To the Editor: Gal Beckerman’s quest for meaning in Judaism takes him everywhere except in the direction of Judaism itself. Lamenting the emptiness in the liberal Jewish world and the growth of assimilation, he sets us on a path to nowhere with his suggestions for books that only reinforce that idea. In fact, Jewish life today is far more nuanced. The historically neat boundaries of denominationalism are fraying. Today Jews search in many directions, and more and more are dabbling with traditional Judaism. Over the span of Jewish history, many have attempted to reframe and restructure Judaism. Those so-called improvements or modernizations have faltered time and again. It comes down to a central question: Why be Jewish? The Judaism of nostalgia — of oh we loved Grandmother’s chicken soup or the familiar melodies or the language of the old country — weakens as memories fade. The Judaism of meaning that Beckerman yearns for is in the Torah. Its wisdom is the core of Judaism and helps us to navigate the challenges of life. Beckerman and many others seek to reinvent and change, lamenting their failure in inspiring the next generation. Instead, they should look inward to the traditions and knowledge that gave meaning to the generations that preceded them and still does today. (RABBI) DAVID ELIEZRIE YORBA LINDA, CALIF. The writer is the author of “The Secret of Chabad.” ♦ To the Editor: The conclusion of Gal Beckerman’s article, arguing that Judaism must be meaningful in order for Jews to survive, is built on the mistaken premise that Jewish survival is an end in itself. Survival is significant if it has a purpose; meaning is not a strategy, it is our calling. In a changing world filled with dilemmas as well as unlimited opportunity, our deep heritage of ideas, texts and values is uniquely capable of elevating our lives and enriching the global moral discourse. (RABBI) ARI BERMAN NEW YORK The writer is president of Yeshiva University. ♦ To the Editor: Of the five new books Gal Beckerman reviewed, all were by senior male writers, some not even scholars of American Judaism. By ignoring the scholarship in American Judaism by women, Beckerman misrepresents the field and misses its most important developments. This error, all too often replicated within and outside the academy, does a disservice to your readers. MARA BENJAMIN SOUTH HADLEY, MASS. The writer is chairwoman of Jewish studies at Mount Holyoke College. ♦ To the Editor: As a confirmed atheist of Jewish background, I want to attest to the possibility of living an entirely assimilated life in the United States without any of the personal angst Gal Beckerman describes in his omnibus review of five books about Judaism. His struggle to decide about the virtues of Reform Judaism versus a more traditional approach that favors holding onto rituals and devotion to a more orthodox version of Judaism may be characteristic of many American Jews, but his presentation implies that his concerns dominate the majority. I believe that the United States is the only country that has allowed Jews to live both without religious belief and ethnic identification. Beckerman’s otherwise informative review underemphasizes the possibility of actually living here without feeling anything but American: not a hyphenated American, just one who feels that this is his home and that being American is the only identity that is comfortable or necessary.

In a letter to the filmmakers, Tom Fiedler, a former journalist who covered Hart’s campaign and is now dean of Boston University’s College of Communication, asked that they “publicly acknowledge that the film’s depiction of me is essentially a fiction.” The letter, sent to the “Front Runner” director, Jason Reitman, and his co-writers, Matt Bai and Jay Carson, follows an op-ed Fiedler wrote last month for his former employer, The Miami Herald, headlined in part, “Truth is left on cutting room floor.” Reitman, Bai and Carson declined to comment for this article. [Read our review of “The Front Runner.”] As a political reporter for The Herald, Fiedler broke the story that Hart was seen with a woman who wasn’t his wife, news that upended Hart’s campaign. The story was published after a Herald team, which included Fiedler, staked out Hart’s home following an anonymous tip — a move that was much criticized at the time. Hart and the woman, Donna Rice, then a 29-year-old actress and pharmaceutical representative, have said they were just friends. Fiedler wrote in his letter, which was shared with reporters, that the movie vilifies him and doesn’t take into account the accuracy of his reporting. Further, he wrote, the actor who portrays him, Steve Zissis, never contacted him. “I wonder if Steve Zissis ever went to the trouble of finding a photograph of me, much less researched my reputation. Had he done so, he would have known I’ve never worn a beard; that I take pride in my appearance and in my physical fitness.” Fiedler said in the letter that the negative portrayal could sway potential students from applying to Boston University, where Fiedler, who started in 2008, is in his final year as a dean. (This reporter attended Boston University’s College of Communication from 2006 to 2010.) Though it was shut out of Golden Globe nominations on Thursday, “The Front Runner” has awards season hopes, and Fiedler said in an email that members of the communication school’s advisory board were concerned that the film might damage the university’s reputation and encouraged him to make public his criticisms. In an October interview before the movie was released, he said that after a private screening, he told Reitman that he had “directed a terrific story and captures the action,” as well as “the frenetic activity that goes on in a campaign.” After the film opened, Fiedler wrote Reitman about his concerns in an email exchange he provided to The Times, and Reitman responded that he never thought of the Fiedler character as the film’s villain, adding, “I’ve always had empathy for what you must have been thinking as this all unfolded.” A dispute between a creative team and a person being portrayed is by no means new. Last spring, a California appellate court dismissed a defamation lawsuit brought by the 101-year-old actress Olivia de Havilland against FX Networks over Catherine Zeta-Jones’s portrayal of her in “Feud: Bette and Joan,” about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford’s volatile relationship. In October, de Havilland filed a petition to have the case heard in the Supreme Court. Mr. Fiedler said he did not plan to sue.

arts After Dispute, ‘Mockingbird’ Blends Novel’s Spirit and Sorkin’s Voice Onstage - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Theater|After Dispute, ‘Mockingbird’ Blends Novel’s Spirit and Sorkin’s Voice Onstage Supported by After Dispute, ‘Mockingbird’ Blends Novel’s Spirit and Sorkin’s Voice Onstage Image LaTanya Richardson as Calpurnia and Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch in the stage adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird.”CreditCreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times By Michael Paulson and Alexandra Alter Dec. 7, 2018 Nine months ago, the estate of Harper Lee sued a theater producer, alleging that a planned stage adaptation of her beloved novel, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” was unacceptably different from the book. Next week, that play will open on Broadway, without many of the elements that concerned the estate, but with dramatic changes — a new narrative structure, black characters who express anger and frustration, and a running tension between civility and confrontation — that could make the story resonant for contemporary audiences. Atticus Finch, the genteel white Alabama lawyer who agrees to defend a black defendant in a rape case, grabs a racist by the hair and threatens to break his arm. Calpurnia, the Finch family cook, questions why prison guards shoot so many times when that defendant tries to flee. And Tom Robinson, the man on trial, gives voice to the racial inequity that has always been at the heart of the story, saying to Atticus in a new jailhouse scene, “I was guilty as soon as I was accused.” The play’s fidelity to the 1960 novel has been a matter of public controversy since the Lee estate sued in March. Shortly before she died, the novelist had authorized a leading contemporary screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, to write the adaptation, but after her death a draft script alarmed the lawyer who represents the estate. Following some initial fireworks — the producer, Scott Rudin, not only countersued but also offered to stage the script in a courthouse so a judge could decide — the case was quietly settled. But the dispute served as a reminder of the challenges inherent in adapting a cherished work — in this case, one that has sold tens of millions of copies. “It has a unique role in American literature, so any person trying to adapt it is going to have their hands full,” said Joseph Crespino, a professor of American history at Emory University and the author of “Atticus Finch: The Biography.” “Whatever you do, you’re going to disappoint some people.” Because the case was privately settled, with neither side describing the terms, and Mr. Rudin has declined to release a script, only now that the play is in previews is it possible to assess how the lawsuit — and the questions it raised about how the book’s generations of die-hard fans might view a contemporary stage adaptation — affected the play’s development. (The play could be further tweaked before it opens Thursday). Image Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation opens on Broadway next week.CreditMichael Tran/FilmMagic The story now being told at the Shubert Theater, starring Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch, will be fully familiar to fans of the novel: It features the same major characters and the same main plot twists. But in ways that are both subtle and significant, the adaptation reflects changes in storytelling and society in the nearly 60 years since the book was published. The biggest changes from the book are structural — the play uses the trial as a narrative scaffolding from which everything else hangs — but there are also shifts in thematic emphasis. In the play, other characters question Atticus’s insistence on seeing goodness in his racist neighbors (“Being polite is no way to win a war,” counters Atticus’s son, Jem), and introduces an impatient yearning for social change expressed by both Atticus and Calpurnia. With litigation threatening the future of the production, each side made concessions, according to public remarks by the writer, Aaron Sorkin, as well as comparisons of the words now being spoken onstage with quotations from the draft script cited by the estate in a letter detailing their objections. The production dropped depictions of Atticus drinking alcohol, keeping a gun in his house and using the name of God disrespectfully; now, as the estate wanted, he is a clean-living hero throughout, who is described in the play’s opening moments as the “most honest and decent person in Maycomb.” And some of the specific language and plot deviations that the estate objected to were removed. For example, a once-contemplated new character — a black physician testifying at the rape trial — was dropped before the show got to Broadway. The estate had complained that the character “introduces numerous highly charged political issues into the trial.” But the production prevailed in its insistence that the two main African-American characters — Calpurnia and Tom — have more opportunities to speak up, particularly about racial injustice and often with considerable emotion or anger, than they do in the novel. And the production preserved the influence of Mr. Sorkin, who unlike most writers, is a pop culture figure in his own right, a distinctly contemporary writer with a penchant for rapid-fire dialogue. The estate’s representative, Tonja B. Carter, had contended that some of the proposed new dialogue made Atticus sound “more like an edgy sitcom dad in the 21st century than the iconic Atticus of the novel.” Image The play’s fidelity to Harper Lee’s 1960 novel has been a matter of public controversy since her estate sued in March.CreditRob Carr/Associated Press Some of the lines she criticized are gone, but many remain, and there are plenty of recognizably Sorkinesque touches — characters talking while walking; soaring emotional speeches by secondary characters; zingers that are witty and pointed. In a March letter to Mr. Rudin, Ms. Carter, who declined to be interviewed for this story, objected to about 80 elements in the script; she later dropped some of those objections. Overall, it now appears, based on two visits to the show in previews, that about 40 percent of those elements are gone. Mr. Rudin declined to make Mr. Sorkin available for an interview. In statements by email, Mr. Rudin said many of the estate’s concerns were with an early draft of the play, and “a vast number” were inaccurate. He said that the current production reflects “exactly the play we want to present” and that no artistic compromises were made as a result of the litigation. “A small handful of issues were simply not important to us, and out of deference to the estate’s wishes, we agreed to them,” he said. This project — with a capitalization cost of up to $7.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission — had some particular risk factors from the start: Lee died shortly after agreeing to allow Mr. Sorkin to write the adaptation, leaving her legacy in the hands of Ms. Carter, who had already created controversy with her role in the publication of “Go Set a Watchman,” an early draft of “Mockingbird,” while Lee was in declining health. On top of that, the production had to tread carefully in its treatment of the novel’s main themes about a child’s awakening to the realities of injustice, violence and bigotry — while at the same time attempting to stage a decades-old work that has outdated views on race and is shot through with racial slurs. In an essay for New York Magazine, Mr. Sorkin described at first being appalled by the suggestion that the production would agree to any changes pressed by the estate, and recalled telling Mr. Rudin, “The play can’t be written by a team of lawyers.” But after being told that the play was in jeopardy, he agreed to make changes — for example, dropping scenes in which Atticus drank and cursed — in exchange for keeping the enhanced roles for Tom and Calpurnia. “The curious part of me wished we’d gone to court so I could hear a federal judge decide what imaginary people would and wouldn’t do,” he wrote. “Instead, we were able to settle without damage to the play other than the unwanted publicity.” Whether or not the publicity was unwanted, the dispute does not appear to have affected consumer appetite. The play has been selling out in previews, and last week grossed an impressive $1.3 million. Follow Michael Paulson on Twitter: @MichaelPaulson. Follow Alexandra Alter on Twitter: @xanalter.

arts On London Stages, the Atmosphere Is Tragic - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Theater|On London Stages, the Atmosphere Is Tragic Supported by London Theater Reviews On London Stages, the Atmosphere Is Tragic Image Nicola Walker and Alun Armstrong in “The Cane” at the Royal Court Theater.CreditCreditJohan Persson By Matt Wolf Jan. 3, 2019 LONDON — Tragedy is the order of the day on the London stage right now, and by the end of the uninterrupted 100 minutes of Mark Ravenhill’s “The Cane,” an intimate, tightly contained drama has acquired a seismic force. The three-character play, and the director Vicky Featherstone’s pitch-perfect production, are on the main stage of the Royal Court Theater through Jan. 26. And yet a continued life seems all but guaranteed for this latest offering from the writer of “Shopping and … ,” the provocative play with the unprintable title that began at the Court in 1996 before moving to the West End and Off Broadway. A domestic drama, a societal indictment and a report from the battered front line of education, “The Cane” charts a trajectory from celebration to vilification. Edward (Alun Armstrong, bruised and bruising) is preparing for his retirement party at the state school where he has worked for nearly a half-century. No teacher, Edward’s fretful wife, Maureen (Maggie Steed), informs us early on, has been so loved. If Maureen’s comment is to be believed, how then to explain the gathering hordes (unseen) of student protesters who have arrived at the couple’s home in such numbers that neither spouse feels able to go outside? Edward’s crime, it seems, is to have administered caning back in the day when that time-honored British custom was still the norm. (The practice was outlawed in state schools in 1986 and in private institutions more than a decade later.) The past has come to haunt the aging Edward’s present, specifically in the form of his daughter, Anna (Nicola Walker, characteristically superb), a one-person mob of her own. The sort of ever-enraged child who once took an ax to the featureless room in which the family has assembled (the wall bears the scars of her rage), Anna is a justice-seeking fury. She would be right at home among the Greek tragedies that “The Cane” comes to resemble. Mr. Ravenhill knows his theater, and you feel not just the influence of the Greeks but also Ibsen and Beckett stalking the treacherous confines of his play. The presence, crucial to the unfolding narrative, of a tall if rickety ladder contains shivery echoes of Ibsen’s “The Master Builder,” another play in which a female outsider sends a male protagonist toppling to his doom. And there’s more than a trace of Beckett’s famously absent Godot to the Head, Edward’s boss, whose arrival is keenly anticipated, though how he would get through the marauders outside is anyone’s guess. “The Cane” anatomizes a world rife with and alive to violence at every turn and disturbs in a way that Mr. Ravenhill’s more obviously confrontational early work didn’t quite manage; this is a far more assured piece of writing. And arriving as it did at the end of a year notably lacking in good British plays, “The Cane” has set a commendably high standard for the year ahead. Image Simon Russell Beale, left, and Joseph Mydell in “The Tragedy of King Richard the Second” at the Almeida Theater.CreditMarc Brenner Across town, at north London’s Almeida Theater through Feb. 2, the director Joe Hill-Gibbins is also exploring suffering. He has cracked a canonical Shakespeare play wide open, to deliver the mercilessness and anger at its luxuriantly worded heart. I’m referring to “The Tragedy of King Richard the Second,” which is the elaborate title here given to a frequently performed history play that usually goes by “Richard II.” (That, indeed, will be the name when it is revived in a separate production next month at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse and performed entirely by women of color.) Mr. Hill-Gibbins, true to his own idiosyncratic, arresting form, has put the text through a shredder and come out with a heavily filleted version. Performed in modern dress within a cell-like space containing buckets labeled “water” and “blood,” the production starts near the end of the expansive original and compresses an incident-packed narrative into 100 minutes performed by a gender-blind, stern-faced cast of eight, many of whom take multiple roles. The self-evident calling card is the appearance of the great Simon Russell Beale in the title role, a part for which he might seem too old on paper — Richard II was 33 when he died and Mr. Russell Beale will soon be 58 — but that he inhabits with the naturalness and ease with verse that are his long-cherished trademarks. Mr. Hill-Gibbins makes you aware of the tensions coursing through this portrait of a divinely anointed king who learns too late what it is to be a human. But when his leading man steps forward to ruminate upon Richard’s lonely and too-brief life, the prevailing aggression of the production — this is the most physical “Richard II” in years — gives way to a glimpse of a fallen monarch with the soul of a poet. Image Judy Kuhn and Andy Nyman at center in “Fiddler on the Roof” at the Menier Chocolate Factory.CreditJohan Persson Another, yet more seasoned director — Trevor Nunn, who will turn 79 this month — has cast his keen eye on an enduring musical title, “Fiddler on the Roof,” for a very fine revival at the Menier Chocolate Factory through March 9. No stranger to either musicals or the classical theater, Mr. Nunn has located within the show’s depiction of familial strife a rending portrait of dislocation that reaches well beyond the early 20th-century shtetl of Anatevka, where the storied 1964 show is set. Yes, you are here attuned as ever to the travails of the hard-laboring milkman, Tevye (Andy Nyman), and his determinedly patient wife, Golde (the gossamer-voiced Judy Kuhn, a visitor from Broadway). But what most sears the memory is the stage picture near the end of a shrouded ensemble being herded away from the home they love — an image of dispossession with resonance the world over. And at the closing moments, when the onstage fiddler plays the final passage of the composer Jerry Bock’s landmark score, the last note is left unheard. That silence haunts the air and evokes a landscape of loss for which there are no words. The Cane. Directed by Vicky Featherstone. Royal Court Jerwood Theater Downstairs, through Jan. 26.

That’s a thing your Carpetbagger often wonders as he wanders through a dense thicket of celebrities at an award-season party. At these soirees, almost everyone is famous, but there is always one person so additionally compelling — think a Meryl or a Leo — that the center of gravity shifts when they enter. The Hollywood parties this weekend, all held in advance of Sunday’s Golden Globes, haven’t lacked for big names like Bradley Cooper, Nicole Kidman and Viola Davis. Still, they were reduced to mere satellites whenever Billy Porter showed up, swanning through each crowd in a new wrap dress and cackling with evident pleasure. “I’m black, I’m turning 50, and I’m fierce!” Porter crowed to me Friday night. He was at W Magazine’s party at the Chateau Marmont to celebrate his Golden Globe nomination for best actor for the FX drama “Pose,” and though most of the men in our orbit wore tasteful suits, Porter was in a black dress with peekaboo cutouts and a wide-brimmed Gucci hat that was half-cowboy, half-coven. “It reminds me a little of Diane Keaton,” said Sarah Silverman, coming over to pay respects. Earlier in the day, Porter had turned heads at the American Film Institute luncheon, where he posed for pictures with the likes of Mahershala Ali while wearing a goldenrod gown. No other dress in the room received quite as many compliments. “One of the things I’ve realized is that I’ve always had a gender-fluid sensibility with clothes, and it was so squashed by homophobia,” Porter told me over champagne. A Tony-winning run in Broadway’s “Kinky Boots” helped Porter get back in touch with his feminine side, and “Pose,” which employs a large cast of mostly queer and trans actors, has only further spurred Porter’s desire to use fashion as a vehicle for self-expression. “I hope that through what I’m doing, it can reach a younger generation, especially the little black boys,” Porter said. “It’s different for us.” As we spoke, I received my umpteenth push alert of the weekend about Kevin Hart, the comedian who withdrew as host of the Oscars and then, after a vociferous defense from the talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, seemed briefly on the verge of getting his gig back. The sticking point was Hart’s refusal to offer a convincing apology for homophobic jokes he had made in his stand-up routine and on Twitter, where he had once mused that if he caught his son playing with his daughter’s dollhouse, he would “break it over his head.” “Show business likes to masquerade as being inclusive and diverse,” said Porter, though attitudes like Hart’s still persist. Even in the fashion world, where you might expect labels to leap at the chance to dress a Golden Globe nominee, “when we ask the houses for male and female clothes, we get the response, ‘We don’t think you should be wearing that,’” Porter said. Still, Porter won’t be sartorially deterred. “I’m grown, and I’m going to wear my dresses,” he said. “I represent something different. I represent a new voice. I represent a challenge to the status quo.” And while that has made him the center of attention at every Globes party, Porter hopes he won’t be sidelined during the main event. “Hopefully I win,” he said. “I’m the black gay guy, I’m the poster child now. People need to see what that looks like.” Related Coverage Ellen DeGeneres: Academy Should Reinstate Kevin Hart as Oscars HostJan. 4, 2019 Image Nicole Kidman Still Can’t Believe What ‘Destroyer’ Did to HerDec. 19, 2018 Image Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword Cooking email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2019 The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions
arts When Did Poetry Speak to Us? When We Were Very Young - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|When Did Poetry Speak to Us? When We Were Very Young Supported by On Poetry When Did Poetry Speak to Us? When We Were Very Young Image Runny Babbit at the cleaners: a Shel Silverstein drawing.CreditCredit© 2017 Evil Eye, LLC By David Orr Dec. 1, 2017 Poetry, as everyone knows, is unpopular. So unpopular, in fact, that critics writing about it for a general audience often choose to acknowledge that state of affairs up front, as I’ve just done, on the ground that it’s easier to be persuasive if you appear to inhabit existing reality, as opposed to behaving as if most people are only an encouraging sentence away from diving into “The Tennis Court Oath.” But it wasn’t always this way. The most remarkable thing about poetry’s unpopularity isn’t that it exists, but that it exists in the wake of a period in which poems were not merely popular, but embraced with a fierce and unembarrassed joy. That period, of course, is childhood. For children, the questions often asked about poetry’s status are so beside the point as to seem almost absurd. Can poetry matter? Obviously, say more than 850,000 copies of “Goodnight, Goodnight Construction Site,” among many, many other rhyming best sellers. Can poetry be widely recited and remembered? Indubitably, say half a million nightly tours of a great green room containing mittens, kittens, a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady who is whispering “hush.” Can a poem be overtly instructive while still being worthwhile as poetry? Well, “a person’s a person, no matter how small,” says a determined elephant named Horton. If adult poetry sometimes seems to exist in the shadow of fiction and music, children’s poetry more than holds its place in the sun. This is in some respects unsurprising. Numerous psychological studies have pointed to the significance of music to an infant’s development of language; indeed, “the further removed a feature of language is from music, the later it is learned,” according to a paper in Frontiers in Psychology by Anthony Brandt, Molly Gebrian and L. Robert Slevc. This would seem to put poetry, the most musical of the language-based arts, in the catbird’s seat. In one of the very few book-length studies of children’s poetry, the British academic Debbie Pullinger argues that poetry “plays a vital integrating role for children,” because it can “return the child to the place where language and the body are felt not as irreconcilable facets of experience but as fundamentally interconnected.” A child experiences a poem not primarily as words a person is using, but as sounds a voice is making. In practice, this means children’s poetry foregrounds the art form’s acoustical elements: rhyme, rhythm, stress. It also means that children’s poetry is unusually, for lack of a better word, fun — or at least, that it unapologetically sets out to be entertaining. Consider RUNNY BABBIT RETURNS (Harper/HarperCollins, $19.99), by Shel Silverstein, a new sequel of sorts to “Runny Babbit,” which was posthumously issued in 2005 (Silverstein died in 1999). If you’re one of the millions raised on “Where the Sidewalk Ends” and “A Light in the Attic,” you know the basic Silverstein approach: humor (often deliberately childish, gross-out humor), rhyme, wordplay and occasional regular versification with heavy doses of doggerel. In “Runny Babbit Returns,” we follow a young rabbit prone to spoonerisms. “Runny’s Irty Dears” is representative: Runny tumbled in the grass Until his grears were een. He clook them to the teaners To get them nice and clean. The cleaner said, “They won’t be ready Till next Saturday.” Runny said, “I’m sorry, I can’t sear a word you hay.” Spoonerisms are amusing because they sound funny, but also because they can overlay two meanings if the transposition creates actual words (that is, what we actually read collides with what we feel should be on the page). Here, Silverstein smartly leads with the first quality (“grears” and “een” is especially good) and delivers the latter in his final line for additional punch as “hear,” “sear,” “hay” and “say” intriguingly commingle. Granted, to an adult reader, a few poems like this may go a long way. Yet it isn’t hard to see the connection between the appeal of this work to a child and the aural attraction a poet like Wallace Stevens holds for older audiences (“This will make widows wince. But fictive things / Wink as they will. Wink most when widows wince”). As we age, our tastes change — but we still need to eat. And in any case, when it comes to technical sophistication, the line between poetry for adults and children can be blurry indeed. Consider the beginning of “Snails,” by Calef Brown: It never fails, those pesky snails Are always in the pudding. Lousy guests, those nasty pests, They’re always up to something. This is a variant on ballad measure, which is to say the stanza rhymes abcb and alternates tetrameter and trimeter phrasings. But it also includes internal rhyme in lines one and three, repetition that borders on internal same rhyme across lines two and four (“always,” “always”), and a neatly executed slant rhyme (“pudding,” “something”) that is buttressed both by the repeated “always” and by a shift from the closed vowel that begins “pudding” to the more open vowel in the first syllable of “something.” This poem is for children, yes. But the expert manipulation of sound is for anyone. For anyone in theory, that is. Because we are returned to the peculiar fact that, for all its allure to children, poetry is a game most adults left behind long ago. And it is fascinatingly alone among the arts in this respect: If children love fiction, music and drama, their parents frequently do as well. There are many reasons for this situation, as there are for all complex cultural phenomena. But it’s interesting to think about the handful of poets who do have adult readers outside the academy — Frost, Eliot, Bishop, Dickinson — and to observe how easy it is to imagine them writing children’s poems (as Eliot in fact did in “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats”). Is there a lesson for poets in that? Here is Eliot in “Little Gidding”: We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. Through the unknown, unremembered gate When the last of earth left to discover Is that which was the beginning; At the source of the longest river The voice of the hidden waterfall And the children in the apple-tree … Do we read this for its intellectual complexity? Or because it sounds mesmerizing? “We read it for both,” most people would answer, and this is perhaps true. But it can be easy to forget the ungovernable, un-footnoteable attraction of sound. It can be easy to forget that this, more than anything else, is what first draws us to poetry, before we become wise enough to think less of it, before we put away childish things.

arts ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ and ‘Green Book’ Share Spotlight at the Golden Globes - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Movies Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Movies|‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ and ‘Green Book’ Share Spotlight at the Golden Globes Supported by Golden Globes Briefing ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ and ‘Green Book’ Share Spotlight at the Golden Globes By Brooks Barnes Jan. 6, 2019 • “Bohemian Rhapsody” won best drama, and its star, Rami Malek, won best actor at the Golden Globes on Sunday night; “Green Book” took home three awards, including best movie, musical or comedy; and Glenn Close won best actress in a drama, an award many expected to go to Lady Gaga. Here’s the complete list of winners. • At last year’s Globes, many women wore black in solidarity with the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. On this year’s red carpet, celebrities wore black-and-white bracelets and ribbons that read #TimesUpx2. • Here’s the best and worst from the show. • Not only was Sandra Oh one of the hosts, but she also won her second Golden Globe — this time for best actress in a television drama as the star of the BBC America series “Killing Eve.” • The Globes, which often teeter on the edge of tipsy chaos, seemed to be coasting on a mellow, it’s-all-good buzz, our TV critic James Poniewozik wrote, adding, “It was pleasant enough, though numbing the longer it went on.” Video The show’s co-host Sandra Oh set the tone of the night early with an emotional speech about diversity in Hollywood. The actress Regina King vowed to hire more women in her productions. And Alfonso Cuarón won best director for his film “Roma,” based on his childhood in Mexico.Published OnJan. 7, 2019CreditCreditPaul Drinkwater/NBC Universal, via Getty Images LOS ANGELES — In a night of major upsets, “Green Book,” a divisive road movie about race relations, emerged as the big winner at the 76th Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, taking home three trophies, including best comedy. “Bohemian Rhapsody” was named best drama, leaving “A Star Is Born,” the expected front-runner, with a lone Globe for best song. Among the other surprises, the veteran Glenn Close beat Lady Gaga for best actress. Gaga was expected to win for “A Star Is Born,” her first leading role in a movie. A shocked Close, who won for “The Wife,” spoke of her mother — a woman “who really sublimated herself to my father her whole life.” “We have to find personal fulfillment,” Close said forcefully after gaining her composure, as actresses in the ballroom jumped to their feet. “We have to follow our dreams.” The ceremony — a rollicking, rowdy affair during which multiple winners were bleeped on the NBC telecast because of their remarks at the microphone — was notable for its attention to diversity. Female winners like Close and Regina King, who won best supporting actress for “If Beale Street Could Talk,” used their moments in the spotlight to speak out for women’s rights. Sandra Oh, as a co-host and a winner for her acting in the TV drama “Killing Eve,” applauded Hollywood for making headway with inclusion efforts. Other winners included the African-American actor Mahershala Ali, for his acting in “Green Book,” and the openly gay Ben Whishaw, who received a Globe for his acting in the Amazon mini-series “A Very British Scandal.” Image Globe voters threw their weight behind Alfonso Cuarón as best director for “Roma.”CreditNBC Universal, Via Getty Images Alfonso Cuarón won best director for “Roma,” his subtitled black-and-white homage to life in Mexico City in the 1970s. “Roma” also won the foreign film prize. “Gracias familia, gracias Mexico,” he said from the stage. “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the blockbuster Freddie Mercury biopic, also won two Globes, with Rami Malek beating Bradley Cooper (“A Star Is Born”) for best actor. (Malek notably did not thank the director of the film, Bryan Singer, who was fired before production was completed.) [How to watch ‘Roma,’ ‘The Americans’ and the other big winners and nominees] “Thank you for your courage in embracing your true self,” Graham King, a “Bohemian Rhapsody” producer, said of Mercury in collecting the best drama Globe. No other film won more than one. A number of movies — “Mary Poppins Returns,” “BlacKkKlansman,” “Black Panther,” “Boy Erased,” “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” — went home empty-handed despite multiple nominations apiece. Glenn Close wins best actress for ‘The Wife’ Image Glenn Close, who starred in “The Wife,” beat Lady Gaga for best actress. Gaga had been expected to win for “A Star Is Born,” her first leading role in a movie.CreditReuters The trophies are almost beside the point at this particular awards stop, which is seen mostly as a moneymaking moment — for NBC; for studios that gain a marketing hook for winter films; and for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the awards. Besides, the association, with a long history of voting idiosyncrasies, has only 88 people who cast ballots. The Oscars, awarded next month, are voted on by about 8,200 movie industry professionals. In fact, over the last 10 years, the Globes and the Oscars have agreed on best picture winners 50 percent of the time. Last year, the foreign press association crowned “Lady Bird” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” Neither won at the Academy Awards, which recognized “The Shape of Water.” The Golden Globes Red Carpet Fashion 77 Photos View Slide Show › Image Valerie Macon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For a change, the big winner on Sunday was expected to be a movie that most people had actually seen: “A Star Is Born,” with roughly $390 million in global ticket sales. Instead, best drama went to “Bohemian Rhapody.” After her upset win was announced, Close, crying and grasping for words, noted that her movie, “The Wife,” took 14 years to get made. Close then said her mother was on her mind — a woman “who really sublimated herself to my father her whole life.” Gaga, Mark Ronson and the other songwriters of “Shallow,” from “A Star Is Born,” collected the Globe for best song. “To the captain of the S.S. Shallow,” Ronson said, speaking first and looking toward Gaga, who was standing next to him with tears in her eyes. “The genius comes from you.” She leaned into the microphone and said, “As a woman in music, it is really hard to be taken seriously as a musician and as a songwriter.” With that, the producers of the show started to play the group offstage, seemingly determined to keep the ceremony moving at a breakneck clip. The foreign press association, rather strangely (or not, given its focus on celebrity), considers foreign films ineligible for its best picture awards, limiting the impact that “Roma” could have on the night. (In another quirk, American studios can dictate where their films compete, hence the classification of “A Star Is Born” as a drama and not a musical.) ‘Green Book’ picks up some needed momentum Image Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in “Green Book.”CreditPatti Perret/Universal Pictures Few films had more riding on Sunday night than “Green Book.” It has been a box-office disappointment, collecting $35 million (roughly half of which goes to theater owners) and costing an estimated $50 million to make and market. Some people adore the film’s feel-good depiction of interracial friendship in the Deep South during the 1960s. Others have been appalled by its reliance on racial clichés. Its win for best comedy or musical may give “Green Book” a much-needed boost. “We’re still living in divided times,” said Peter Farrelly, who directed the film. “This story, when I heard it, gave me hope.” “Green Book” also won best screenplay and best supporting actor, which went to Ali, who plays an erudite pianist in the film. Olivia Colman won best actress in a comedy or musical for her work in “The Favourite,” a pitch-black comedy about royal schemers. Best actor in a comedy or musical went to Christian Bale, who portrayed the former vice president Dick Cheney in “Vice.” “Thank you, Satan, for giving me inspiration on how to play this role,” Bale said in accepting the award. In accepting her trophy for best supporting actress, King thanked her publicists and then, refusing to leave the stage as the orchestra started up, spoke about the need for equal employment opportunities for women, in Hollywood and elsewhere. “Time’s Up times two,” she said. ‘The Americans’ and ‘The Kominsky Method’ are winners Image Keri Russell in “The Americans,” which won best television drama.CreditEric Liebowitz/FX For all of the attention given to the movie winners, best actress in a TV drama was one of the most intriguing matchups of the night, pitting a co-host versus a Hollywood legend. Oh won for her performance in BBC America’s buzzy “Killing Eve.” She beat out, among others, the Oscar-winning Julia Roberts, nominated for playing a mysterious counselor on Amazon’s “Homecoming,” her first regular television role. Oh was not recognized by Emmys voters in September. Both “Killing Eve” and “Homecoming” were passed over for best television drama, however. That award went to the FX spy drama “The Americans” — an honor the series never achieved at the Emmys before ending its six-season run last year. In a surprise, “The Kominsky Method” (Netflix) beat “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon) for best television comedy. A creator of “The Kominsky Method,” Chuck Lorre, thanked Michael Douglas and the show’s other star, Alan Arkin. “Without them the script for this would be landfill,” Lorre said. He concluded by saying what many in the room were thinking throughout the night: “Netflix. Netflix. Netflix. Netflix. Netflix. Netflix.” Douglas won best actor for his work on the show. “For 45 years, you’ve always surprised me and treated me so well,” Douglas said, addressing the members of the press association. He dedicated the award to his father, Kirk Douglas, 102. Amazon did get one win when the star of “Mrs. Maisel,” Rachel Brosnahan, retained her crown for best actress in a TV comedy. It was not a good night for HBO, which only converted one of its nine nominations into a win: Patricia Clarkson received the Globe for her supporting role in “Sharp Objects.” A feel-good ceremony Image Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh breezed through a “nicing” of the room instead of the usual roasting.CreditNBC Universal Via Getty Images The Globes dispensed with the seriousness that characterized last year’s ceremony, when actresses draped themselves in black to protest sexual harassment, and got underway at the Beverly Hilton on Sunday night with red gowns, an award for comedic TV acting and a co-host yelling, “We’re going to have some fun!” With that, Andy Samberg and the night’s other host, an ebullient Oh, breezed through a “nicing” of the room instead of the usual roasting. They did not make one joke at President Trump’s expense. Jim Carrey, a nominee for Showtime’s “Kidding,” participated in a goofy gag from a table in the ballroom. The sharpest bits came from Oh, who pretended to be a Neanderthal studio executive searching for a director — “First, man. If man not available, pair of man.” — and ended with a teary acknowledgment of the “moment of change” in Hollywood over the past year regarding diversity onscreen. “Right now,” she said, “this moment is real.” In praise of Jeff Bridges and Carol Burnett Image Jeff Bridges collected the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in film.CreditNBC Universal, via Getty Images Jeff Bridges collected the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in film, and Carol Burnett accepted a new award, named after her, for career achievement in television. Steve Carell presented Burnett with the award, calling her “one of the most revered, respected and most well-liked people in show business” before making an off-color quip about nice-guy Tom Hanks that NBC censors bleeped. Julia Roberts offered a rambunctious hoot from the audience, which jumped to its feet. “I’m really gobsmacked by this,” Burnett, 85, said. “Does this mean I get to accept it every year?” She used most of her speech to reminisce about the TV industry of the 1960s and ’70s, ending with her signature line, “I’m so glad we got this time together.” Bridges, 69, offered no deep thought on any topic other than the joy of being alive, using most of his time to rattle off thank yous. “I’ve got to thank my sweetheart,” he said, gesturing to his wife, Susan Geston. “Forty-five years of support and love.” What did our critics say? The culture critics Aisha Harris, Wesley Morris and Kyle Buchanan were sharing their thoughts on the ceremony, winners and snubs over on Twitter. Morris approved of Oh and Samberg’s approach to hosting. While Buchanan offered some insight into the ceremony. There was bemusement over some of the winners.

arts ‘Love Is Blind,’ but Lust Isn’t - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|‘Love Is Blind,’ but Lust Isn’t Supported by Fiction ‘Love Is Blind,’ but Lust Isn’t Image CreditCreditLeigh Guldig Buy Book ▾ Amazon Local Booksellers Barnes and Noble When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. By Zachary Woolfe Dec. 6, 2018 LOVE IS BLIND By William Boyd 369 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95 In his new novel, William Boyd has a veteran pianist explain the way a piece of music draws a listener’s tears: Just when you think you know where the harmony is going to go, it remains tantalizingly unresolved. “An old trick,” the pianist says. “But old tricks are the best.” That’s the bet Boyd is making in “Love Is Blind,” his 15th novel. Like the music his brilliant if drunken keyboard virtuoso is describing, the narrative never veers from the expected; even its twists fit into well-worn grooves. This is a “play it again, Sam” kind of production, the novelistic equivalent of the showy orchestral chestnut “Pines of Rome.” “Love Is Blind” goes down easy, its pleasures are vaguely guilty, and upon setting it down, it swiftly vanishes from the mind. Boyd’s books have included more serious (and more funny) efforts — like “Any Human Heart” (2003), a vigorous account of a 20th-century life, and the richly nuanced, darkly comic “An Ice-Cream War” (1983) — as well as slighter, larkier ones like this. (Five years ago he published “Solo,” a James Bond novel that got a mixed reception.) In the past, he has sometimes been intrigued by larger issues, like the mutability of identity and the helplessness of individuals confronted with — and subsumed by — the great processes of history. With implausible suavity, “Brazzaville Beach” (1991) interwove its characters’ motivations with the study of primate evolution. (Yes, you and me, according to Boyd, we ain’t nothin’ but mammals.) [ Why characters like James Bond do, indeed, live more than once. ] But there’s no philosophical armature to “Love Is Blind,” only the most convoluted of bildungsromans. His fin de siècle hero — a sensualist, as is Boyd’s wont in his young male stars — is Brodie Moncur, a quick-witted Scot with a gift for tuning pianos. His is the art and craft not just of tightening an instrument’s screws, but also of subtly tailoring its mechanisms to an expert player’s strengths and weaknesses. (The vocation also inspired Daniel Mason’s similarly smooth 2002 novel, “The Piano Tuner.”) Sent from Edinburgh to Paris by his piano-maker employer to help open a new branch of the business, Brodie comes up with a plan to market the brand by securing an endorsement deal with a star musician. He settles on John Kilbarron — “a bit passé, perhaps, but one of the real old-school klaviertigers 10 or 20 years ago.” Image Kilbarron’s nickname is the “Irish Liszt,” and Boyd seems to want to evoke the fervid, sweaty, dazzling artistry of Franz Liszt, whose hysteria-arousing recitals were the Elvis concerts of their day. But “Love Is Blind” isn’t all that interested in conveying the experience of listening to — let alone playing — music, even if there are sweet little descriptions of the invisible trickery (thin strips of lead glued here, a faint sanding-down there) that is the tuner’s sleight of hand. What Boyd is interested in conveying the experience of is lust. Brodie falls helplessly in love with Kilbarron’s mistress, the aspiring Russian singer Lika Blum (who responds, in kind), and follows to St. Petersburg the whole musical entourage, including the pianist’s menacing brother, Malachi. Brodie and Lika’s subterfuges grow less and less tenable, and the lovers eventually flee, but they find themselves entangled in, and finally shattered by, a Kilbarron family secret — albeit one that’s been loudly hinted at for much of the book. Into this rather longwinded and stagy mix, Boyd throws a variety of devices: a tyrannical father, an allegation of musical plagiarism, a false accusation of fraud and a simmering case of tuberculosis. (Of course Brodie has to come down with that classic disease of sex and creativity.) There are halfhearted efforts to place the plot vividly in its time. “While he lay in bed waiting for visitors,” Boyd writes, “Brodie read newspapers. He read about the continuing animosities of the Dreyfus Affair, the celebrations being organized around Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee, the economic tribulations facing President McKinley, and a review of a shocking novel called ‘Dracula.’” Yep, 1897 it is! Its title suggests that, while its milieu is music, the novel is more directly concerned with immortalizing great passions in general — in finding sensuality wherever it may lurk, including in the sonic. But the book’s promise of eroticism ends up involving only some risible sex writing. “He reached down and touched her,” Boyd writes of Brodie and Lika’s lovemaking, “his fingers on the thick blond furze of her pubis, cupping it under his palm. He felt hugely aroused again, massively potent.” Perhaps this prose is meant to feel cozily dated, like the character that Boyd describes as “dressed in a style that had been fashionable half a century before.” If so, it’s depressing that he thought that classical music would be the perfectly complementary subject matter, as lovably hoary as the narrative style he is pantomiming. In any case, however, there are only flickers of the charm you would want to steadily emanate from such a period production. “Love Is Blind” eventually reminded me of a tired revival of one of Franco Zeffirelli’s decades-old, hyper-naturalistic stagings for the Metropolitan Opera: all surface detail, no life. “He looked intently at her face in the oval cameo,” Boyd writes, “but the dated formalities of the pose, the exposure’s long hold denied any sense of the real person emerging from the portrait.” Zachary Woolfe is the classical music editor for The Times.

arts Everything That Happened on the Golden Globes Red Carpet - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Style Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Style|Everything That Happened on the Golden Globes Red Carpet Supported by Everything That Happened on the Golden Globes Red Carpet Lady Gaga talked about “going to the nectar” of her being, Charlize Theron told Emily Blunt to meet her in the back alley, and Idris Elba promised to “rock Coachella.” The Golden Globes Red Carpet Fashion 77 Photos View Slide Show › Image Valerie Macon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Valeriya Safronova Jan. 6, 2019 The 2019 Golden Globes marks one year since attendees signaled their commitment to fighting sexual misconduct and inequity in the workplace by donning Time’s Up pins and bringing activists — including Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, and Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance — to the ceremony as their guests. Since last January, protests on the red carpet have mostly waned, and tonight’s red carpet was also apolitical. Here are some of the highlights: Our complete list of Golden Globes winners — with lots of surprises — is right here. Lady Gaga arrived wearing a periwinkle couture Valentino gown and Giuseppe Zanotti platform heels, and discussed her evolution from musician to actress. (She is nominated for best actress in a motion picture, drama for her role in “A Star Is Born.”) “I discovered something in working on this film and it’s something called alchemy,” Lady Gaga said. “I learned a lot about going to the nectar of your being,” she added, explaining that acting, for her, was about tapping into “something I had already in me.” Idris Elba, whose appearance on the Coachella lineup was announced to much surprise last week, discussed his musical leanings on the red carpet. “I play house,” Mr. Elba said. “I’ve been DJing all my life. I’m going to rock Coachella. I can’t wait.” Isan Elba, Mr. Elba’s 17-year-old daughter, is this year’s Golden Globe ambassador, a role that goes to celebrity offspring every year (past ambassadors include Dakota Johnson, Rumer Willis, and Sylvester Stallone’s three daughters Sistine, Sophia and Scarlet, but the role was previously called Miss or Mr. Golden Globe in the past). What advice did Mr. Elba have for Isan? Keep your back straight, smile and nod politely, and “if you feel like you’re going to pass out, don’t,” he said. Thanks, dad! What does Charlize Theron want to say to Emily Blunt, her friend and fellow nominee in the category for best actress in a musical or comedy? “I’ll meet you in the back alley.” Huh? Ms. Theron explained: After the nominations were announced, Ms. Theron sent Ms. Blunt a drawing by one of her children that depicted the two women as ice queens fighting each other, and said, “This is going to be us at the Globes.” The actresses played sisters at war with each other in “The Huntsman: Winter’s War.” But off screen? Ms. Theron said: “We’re sisters. It’s for life.” Debra Messing said she was the sole representative from “Will & Grace” at the Globes. Ms. Messing, who has been nominated nine times, including this year, but has never won, distilled what takes place at the event into several words: “We drink. At the Golden Globes that’s what you do. You drink.” Rami Malek, wearing Givenchy, answered why he thinks he was cast as Freddy Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which is nominated for best motion picture, drama: “I think it was a little bit of the mischief I have going on behind my eyes,” said Mr. Malek, who is also nominated for best actor in a motion picture, drama for the role. Carol Burnett, a 16-time Golden Globe nominee and five-time winner, will now have an award named after her. “I guess now I’ll have to keep my name,” Ms. Burnett said. On the red carpet, Ryan Seacrest asked about how it might feel to see the award given out annually. “Maybe they’ll give it to me every year,” Ms. Burnett said. “I don’t know.” Wearing a custom Vera Wang dress with a long train, Alison Brie talked about an Instagram video of her doing pull-ups with a 25-pound weight wrapped around her hips — part of the training she does for her role in “GLOW,” for which she was nominated for best actress in a television series, musical or comedy. When she joined the Netflix series, Ms. Brie knew she’d have to up the ante on her workouts. “I wanted to get really strong,” she said. “We do all our own stunts, we do our own wrestling moves.” Asked about how she connected to the role of Lynne Cheney in “Vice,” for which she is nominated for best actress in a supporting role, Amy Adams said she thought about her grandmother, who was from Utah and of the same generation as the former second lady. The mentality the two shared, Ms. Adams said, was “if you want to get out of a situation, you’re responsible for yourself, especially as a woman.” Ken Jeong is a man of many talents. After talking about improvising on the set of “Crazy Rich Asians,” which is nominated for the best musical or comedy — “I do a lot of make-em-ups everywhere I go,” he said — the former physician told a story about helping to save a life at one of his shows: “I was doing stand-up comedy back in May and someone in the third row had a seizure,” Mr. Jeong said. “I jumped off the stage.” Regina King, who is nominated for two awards, including for best actress in a supporting role for “If Beale Street Could Talk” and for her role in “Seven Seconds,” a Netflix series, arrived on the red carpet with her son, Ian Alexander, Jr. Ms. King said she was initially hesitant to join the cast of “Seven Seconds.” “To know that I was going to have to be in the space of a mother losing her child, it was terrifying.” She added: “I realized it was my own fear of being in a place I never want to be in.” Valeriya Safronova is a reporter for the Style section.

arts Out of Silence, the Music of Meditation - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Music|Out of Silence, the Music of Meditation Supported by Critic’s Notebook Out of Silence, the Music of Meditation Image The clarinetist Martin Frost and the pianist Henrik Mawe play during a recent Live Music Meditation event at Princeton University.CreditCreditBryan Anselm for The New York Times By Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim Jan. 4, 2019 PRINCETON, N.J. — For as long as I can remember, I have loved the silences of the concert hall almost as much as the sounds. The expectant hush that falls on an auditorium when the oboe’s A pierces through the hum of voices and the lights dim. The way a spellbound audience can wrap a protective silence around a pianissimo ending. But on a recent afternoon in Richardson Auditorium at Princeton University here, silence became an equal partner to the music. I was in the hall for a series called Live Music Meditation. (The next event, on March 28, features the violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja.) For the first 20 minutes, while listeners quietly filed in, I sat motionless with my eyes closed, noting the sounds of footsteps and the rustle of coats. Gradually, the calm deepened, broken now and then by a male voice inviting us to focus on our breath, relax our shoulders, and clear our minds. From inside this stillness, the sound of a gong rang out like a bright explosion, followed by waves of amber overtones that seemed to dance with each other in space. Then more silence, long minutes of nothing to hear but the breathing of strangers. When the first notes of a clarinet threaded their way into my consciousness, they seemed to come from inside me. For the next half-hour, as a piano joined the clarinet, music wound its way through me as sound turned pure sensation. Eventually the last note settled back into silence. Then one more time the gong, followed by that male voice, sounding a little sheepish: “Some people would find it appropriate to clap now.” Image CreditBryan Anselm for The New York Times The applause, when it came, did seem out of place. And the performers, the clarinetist Martin Frost and the pianist Henrik Mawe, didn’t bow. In an onstage discussion after the unusual concert, they professed to being somewhat overwhelmed. “We were so aware of you listening to us so intensely that we started to listen to ourselves even more intensely, too,” Mr. Mawe said. An audience member told the musicians that, for him, “the most special thing was the silence before and after you played. There was anticipation without expectation.” The series, which is free to the public, was conceived by Dasha Koltunyuk, a pianist and a longtime member of a meditation group led by Matthew Weiner, a dean in the office of religious life at the university. By combining guided meditation with live music, she hoped to create a space in which, she said in a statement, “our tendency toward passivity or judgment while hearing music disperses into a pure, perceptive and receptive state of intense, present listening.” Composers have long played with silence. In the 20th century, they began to dissolve the border between scripted silence inside the music — the rests — and the ambient silence of a given acoustic space. Ligeti’s “Lux Aeterna” fades into seven bars of rest at the end. John Cage’s “4’33”” consists entirely of notated silence. These days, more presenters are experimenting with ways to make the audience aware of its role in creating the silence out of which music grows. When the artist Marina Abramovic presented the pianist Igor Levit in Bach’s “Goldberg” Variations at the Park Avenue Armory in 2015, listeners were relieved of their cellphones and outfitted with noise-dampening headphones that helped them sink into deep quiet for 30 minutes before the first notes of Bach. Concerts inside the Moab Music Festival’s red rock grotto in Utah begin with an invitation to take in the stillness of the natural setting. A two-minute “celebration of silence” is at the center of Chatter in Albuquerque, N.M., and Gather NYC at SubCulture in Manhattan, both Sunday morning series combining classical music and storytelling. In a telephone interview, the violinist and conductor David Felberg, who runs Chatter, said that most audience members close their eyes for that period. “They’re either meditating or trying to listen to the sounds that exist naturally around them,” he said. “For us, it’s a bit of a palate-cleanser. It’s almost like you’re fresh and ready to listen to the music.” Mr. Weiner, the Princeton dean, who led the guided meditation, said in an interview that he thinks of the quality created in the room not so much as silence but as sensitivity. In Buddhism, he said, that “doesn’t just mean verbal silence with your tongue. It means softening the constructions in your mind that get in the way of experiencing what’s in front of you.” As a critic normally tasked with shaping those constructions into written words, I was keenly aware of that softening. And as a diligent but novice meditator, I caught a glimpse, through the music, of what it means to let thoughts bubble up without engaging with them — through applause or judgment. Here was music not as a text to be read nor a recreational drug to be consumed for mood management, but as an audible process of coming-into-being and fading-away. And, for a short while, listening turned into a state of pure receptivity: beginner’s ear.

arts At Jingle Ball, Finding Out Who’s Learned to Play Nice - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Music|At Jingle Ball, Finding Out Who’s Learned to Play Nice Supported by Live Review At Jingle Ball, Finding Out Who’s Learned to Play Nice Image Cardi B was the headliner of this year’s installment of Z100’s Jingle Ball.CreditCreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times By Jon Caramanica Dec. 9, 2018 “I’m not like Normani. I can’t sing and dance at the same time, girl — I get tired.” This was Cardi B, midway through her set at Madison Square Garden on Friday night, taking a quick water break and, as is her wont — her gift — advertising the fact that she was taking a quick water break so endearingly that you almost overlooked what was really happening. This time last year, she had a couple of big singles, a famous boyfriend and a growing profile. Now she has one of the year’s most impressive albums, an unbroken string of smash hit guest appearances, a boyfriend-turned-husband who’s soon to be her ex, and a daughter. And she was the headliner of this year’s installment of Z100’s Jingle Ball, part of a traveling set of end-of-year revues in support of, and sponsored by, iHeartRadio pop stations around the country. By any metric, her ascent has been rapid. But there she was, the 12th performer of the night, one of the most successful of the group, and the only one who bore almost no traces of the old star-making machine. So no, she is not a Normani, formerly of the girl group Fifth Harmony, now in the early stages of a solo career. Not someone who brings military precision to her stage show. Not someone who’s graduated from live-performance boot camp. Image Khalid and Normani performed a duet.CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times Even though Cardi’s set was boisterous, bawdy and brutally effective, cramming in bits of more than 10 songs, she is not quite a performer yet. She was often the least energized person onstage — there were, at times, 10 backup dancers, which felt like overcompensation. Filling an arena requires different skills than filling a phone screen. For Jingle Ball, she is a different sort of star: one who hasn’t spent years training for moments like this. And she is indicative of a future in which pop stars will be able to arrive at full saturation without necessarily going through the old preparations. With a handful of exceptions, almost everyone else on this bill — Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha and more — came by their success the old-fashioned way: extensive practice, songwriting-by-committee, record label largess, radio-airplay complicity. Image Dua Lipa’s set felt better suited for a dark club than an airy arena.CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times Within this ecosystem, there are performers who rise to occasions like these, which are often graceless, and those who see it for what it is — a transactional arrangement that in essence promises them extended radio exposure. (It seems likely that a decade from now, or less, sponsoring stack-em-and-pack-em concerts like these will be more the preserve of streaming services than radio conglomerates.) Image Shawn Mendes covered the Kings of Leon song “Use Somebody.”CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times In that first category was Mendes, who performed early in the night, presumably because he had somewhere more meaningful to be at the dinner hour. He had the radiance of someone around whom light naturally falls, and the ramrod posture of a very good boy. His voice is thin, but getting more interesting as he ages — he was guttural at the outset of his cover of Kings of Leon’s “Use Somebody,” and he brought a lithe lilt to “Lost in Japan.” “Treat You Better,” still his best song, was zippier and a little more punk than the original. Even though his songs vibrate with anxiety, he did not. (Cabello is in this group too — her performance was committed but rote.) Image Alessia Cara, wearing a stylishly ill-fitting suit, tested the pop-marathon format with a cover of the holiday novelty “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas.”CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times In the other category was Alessia Cara, a soul singer with a detailed voice a couple of decades older than she is and an apparent allergy to fame’s dictates. “New York, you doing good?” she asked, then pivoted, continuing, “This song is about not doing so good.” That was “Not Today,” which, like several of her best songs, are about feeling awkward (see also: “Here”) and a few years of pop success haven’t changed that. By comparison to the rest of the performers, she was a live-wire dissenter. She wore a stylishly ill-fitting suit. Her dance moves consisted of jumping up and down like an exuberant tween. Midset, she performed the holiday novelty classic “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas,” serving a little surrealism in the pop vortex. Image Meghan Trainor’s retro soul-pop was a big hit with the Jingle Ball audience.CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times Image Calvin Harris’s club set was rapturously received by the Madison Square Garden crowd.CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times Her performance was one of the night’s best, even if it wasn’t received as rapturously as Calvin Harris’s zip file of a club set, or Meghan Trainor’s almost parodically retro soul-pop (though she delivered it sharply, especially the country-esque gusto on “Like I’m Gonna Lose You.”) Lipa was as ill-suited to this format as Cara, but for different reason: She is an effortless channeler of the club music of the early 1990s, and her performance felt micro, better suited for a dank club than a spacious arena. Jingle Ball doesn’t reward subtlety — bad news for Khalid, who sang well and glowed with kindness, to little effect — or reticence. It is a marketing opportunity masquerading as a concert, and sometimes not even: literal ads run in between performances (including one for Cocofloss, which appeared to be some sort of venture-capital, subway-ad-takeover dental floss). As compared to previous years, this lineup was comparatively low wattage: Bazzi performed his algorithm pop early in the night, followed by a struggle-pop performance without energy, edge or charm from the onetime Disney Channel star Sabrina Carpenter. Apart from Cardi, the only other rapper on the bill was G-Eazy, who is white, and who didn’t perform one song that didn’t feature someone else on the hook. Image Bebe Rexha’s full-throttle set bordered on overintense.CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times In the middle of the show was Rexha, a not-quite-pop-star with a big voice and bigger ambition. She was dressed like an encrusted elf, and she was backed by a band that applied bar-rock pungency to her pop hits. There is dignity to be found in chafing at these sorts of events, and Rexha’s intense, perhaps overintense set was admirable in its way. But she wasn’t there not to play nice. Near the end of her performance, she made sure to thank the night’s real engine of support: “Big shout to Capital One!” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C2 of the New York edition with the headline: Stars, Rough or Polished, Shine at Pop Gala.

We can go on, but why don’t you see for yourself. “The wings are enormous, but the puppeteers and dancers were game,” the photographer, Sasha Arutyunova, said of shooting in the alley next to the Broadway production of “Angels in America.”CreditCreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Supported by Selected by Alana Celii, Marysa Greenawalt, Christy Harmon, Laura O’Neill and Jolie Ruben Introduction by Michael Cooper Dec. 28, 2018 Art can provoke, asking pointed questions in troubled times. It can also soothe, providing beauty and solace when they seem in short supply. And its ability to simply entertain should not be discounted, either: It is no small thing to offer respite with a laugh, a jolt of suspense, a juicy saga, a visual marvel or an irresistible beat. All of those qualities shine through in this selection of some of our favorite arts photography published this year by The New York Times — sometimes in the same image. Photographers bore witness: at a listening party Kanye West held in Wyoming; as Tony Kushner’s masterwork, “Angels in America,” returned to Broadway in the age of Trump; as Caroll Spinney, who played Big Bird on “Sesame Street,” hung up his claws and yellow feathers. They took us behind the scenes, from a salsa party called Las Chicas Locas to the wings of the Metropolitan Opera, where the diva Elina Garanca was preparing to open the season. Group photos shed light on the actors who made us believe in Wakanda in “Black Panther,” and those who proved that the rom-com is not dead with “Crazy Rich Asians” — and who broke Hollywood racial barriers in the process. And revealing portraits captured the pop producer and songwriter Teddy Geiger as she embraced her new openness after coming out as a transgender woman; the comedian Ali Wong as her humor tapped a nerve; and the novelist Philip Roth, photographed at his home in Manhattan months before his death. Have a look.

Supported by Nonfiction Can Americans Get Along?

By Eric Wakin Jan. 4, 2019 FAULT LINES A History of the United States Since 1974 By Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. Zelizer Illustrated. 428 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $28.95. Conventional wisdom holds that Americans are polarized, divided, tribalized — choose your word — over significant policy issues and that our two political parties abet and fuel this schism. Leaving aside the distinction between polarized political parties and a polarized people for the moment, the nation is surely in a time of political, intellectual and emotional realignment. Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. Zelizer’s “Fault Lines” grafts a geologic metaphor onto three divisive threats to our democracy as suggested by Barack Obama in his January 2017 farewell address — economic, racial and political — while adding a fourth, gender and sexuality. The authors argue that these divisions have allowed the two parties, which are seen through the fractured lens of “the media,” to create a situation in which Americans have become more polarized than ever. Their premise is that what they call “fault lines” have always existed but until recently were held in check by a “robust federal government, a thriving middle-class economy and a powerful union movement.” They hammer home their “fault line” metaphor with Stakhanovite repetition. Almost every chapter is organized according to the rules familiar to any public speaker: “In the first part I tell ’em what I am going to tell ’em; in the second part I tell ’em; and in the third part I tell ’em what I’ve told ’em.” Image Kruse and Zelizer, who have based their book on a course they created at Princeton, begin with the story of the unraveling of the “somewhat forced ‘consensus’ of the postwar era” in the 1960s and ’70s, quickly moving through capsule histories of the series of “crisis” events and issues that reordered the outlook of Americans — Watergate, stagflation, racial equality, feminism, gay rights and more. Stepping in to exploit these unleashed fault lines, according to the authors, is “an aggressive new conservative movement … amplified by a fragmented partisan media.” But are Americans really divided by fault lines? Interestingly, there is a great deal of research that shows it is the political parties that are polarized but not the American people. Political scientists describe this situation as “party sorting.” That is, the Democratic and Republican Parties have devolved into two separate groups that offer ideological and policy conformity with almost no overlap. Remember liberal Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller of New York or conservative Democrats like Zell Miller of Georgia? They almost don’t exist anymore (Joe Manchin of West Virginia excepted) because neither party in its current iteration would have them. The actual fault lines, it might be said, are between the parties, not between two groups of the public. For the past 25 years, according to Gallup, over a third of Americans have identified as moderate, and the number of independents reached an all-time high in 2013. Even the famous 2014 Pew Survey on polarization noted that the majority of Americans “do not have uniformly conservative or liberal views.” Where fault-line-like division is most pronounced is among the most politically engaged Americans. Examples of these folks abound in “Fault Lines.” So if the real story is that the political parties have sorted ideologically and are appealing to the most ideologically engaged voters, who happen to be the most outraged, what is to be done? Kruse and Zelizer argue for Americans to build bridges “that can bring us closer together,” although they are also refreshingly frank about the cant of postelection remarks on coming together — noting the ritualistic aspect whose constant repetition is, in fact, an acknowledgment of division. Kruse and Zelizer begin their book with Obama’s farewell address. They might have ended it with two points the Obama speech made as well: “Hold fast to the faith written into our founding documents” and “regardless of our party affiliation or particular interest, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.” Embracing both of those points might do the trick. Then again, it might not. Eric Wakin is a research fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and the Robert H. Malott director of the institution’s library and archives.

arts At Prototype, a Posthumous Play Revived as Chamber Opera - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|At Prototype, a Posthumous Play Revived as Chamber Opera Supported by At Prototype, a Posthumous Play Revived as Chamber Opera Image Gweneth-Ann Rand and Susanna Hurrell in “4.48 Psychosis,” which comes to the Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now festival Jan. 5-12.CreditCreditStephen Cummiskey By Alexis Soloski Dec. 31, 2018 In the months before she hanged herself in 1999, the English playwright Sarah Kane woke up, nearly every morning, at exactly 4:48 a.m. As she went on and off drugs and in and out of hospitals, she wrote her final play, “4:48 Psychosis,” an anguished, mordant, fragmentary work, dissociative in form and content. A throat-shredding scream of a play, it has been staged and restaged since its posthumous premiere in 2000. It is now a chamber opera. Composed by Philip Venables and directed by Ted Huffman, the Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now festival’s “4:48 Psychosis,” which had its premiere in London in 2016 and opens in New York on Jan. 5, makes music of a play with no delineated characters, few clear scene breaks and no stage directions except for occasional, italicized pleas for silence. “It’s not a piece that works by who says what on stage, and that is wonderfully liberating for an opera,” Mr. Venables said, speaking by telephone from London. [Other festivals in January: Read about a play by Gracie Gardner at the Exponential Festival and Under the Radar at the Public Theater.] Mr. Venables’s interpretation relies on six voices, three sopranos and three mezzo-sopranos, who convey — together and separately — the competing and often contradictory voices inside one woman’s head. In scenes where a psychiatrist or some other medical professional seems to be speaking, two percussionists beat out the speech rhythms as the text is projected in a rear wall. The orchestra is visible and sometimes the sound overwhelms the singers, Mr. Venables said, “like a kind of really powerful emotion that you can’t overcome.” (William Cole will be the conductor, replacing Richard Baker, who had to withdraw because of illness.) The music itself is “eclectic,” Mr. Venables said: passages inspired by Baroque and religious music, but also percussive attacks. As in Ms. Kane’s script, there are darkly witty passages, too, like the interspersed snatches of electronic music, canned lounge tunes that might play in doctor’s waiting rooms. Kim Whitener, one of the festival’s founding directors, described the score’s unique ability “to evoke the confusion, the fear, the panic, the chaos that is in this person’s mind.” Rather than fastening on Ms. Kane’s biography, Mr. Venables has allowed her text to suggest something more universal, “a story for humanity,” he said, “a story for every person in that we all have dark thoughts, we all have times in our life when we suffer depression.” While some stagings have emphasized the violence and the rawness of the prose — it is, admittedly, very raw (“DON’T LET THIS KILL ME THIS WILL KILL ME AND CRUSH ME AND SEND ME TO HELL”) — Mr. Venables has decided that the text also speaks to search for love and he wants “4:48 Psychosis” to push its listeners toward “somehow appreciating joy and love and good things in our lives more,” he said. Ms. Kane’s own story ended early and painfully. Yet the end of “4:48 Psychosis,” he promised, “is quite cathartic.” “I hope it is anyway.” ONE MORE FROM PROTOTYPE “The Infinite Hotel,” a hybrid of live film and opera written and directed by Michael Joseph McQuilken, casts the audience as extras inside a story about five strangers who collide, melodically.

arts Hunger Games: Three Memoirs Where Food Takes Center Stage - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Hunger Games: Three Memoirs Where Food Takes Center Stage Supported by The Shortlist Hunger Games: Three Memoirs Where Food Takes Center Stage Image CreditCreditJohn Gall By Irina Dumitrescu Jan. 1, 2019 THE BREAD AND THE KNIFE A Life in 26 Bites By Dawn Drzal 257 pp. Arcade. $19.99. Image Culinary memoirists often seem torn between telling a story and sharing their favorite dishes. As befits a former cookbook editor, Drzal centers the food, offering us an alphabet of 26 gastronomical essays ranging from “Al Dente” to “Zucchini Blossoms.” A sprinkling of recipes completes the collection. Reading these evocative pieces feels like pulling old Polaroids out of a shoe box. “F” is for “Fowl,” a freshly shot pheasant Drzal cooks for M.F.K. Fisher. The result is so tasteless and tough that Fisher nearly chokes to death. “L” is the exquisite lobster roll Drzal springs for at the Clam Shack in Kennebunk, Me., as she comes to terms with both her divorce and her reduced bank account. “T” recalls the messy tarte Tatin she bakes for her dying father-in-law, and her quiet pleasure when he eats a full slice. Drzal traces the delicate emotions packed into a scene with the precision of a miniaturist. She is particularly skilled at conveying the quality of pleasure taken in the face of loss. A 1990 dinner party in her Brooklyn brownstone achieves a perfect alchemy of guests, food and music, and is crowned by an enchanting snowfall outside. The moment feels sublime to Drzal. But when she runs into one of the guests 15 years later and is given the cold shoulder, she realizes that all the human connections at that party, including her marriage, were “as ephemeral as the meal.” While food provides the hooks for Drzal’s memories, the collection thrums for other reasons: her moments of unflinching but forgiving self-criticism, descriptions of place that transport readers with a minimum of detail, and a knack for metaphors so perfect as to seem inevitable. In Southeast Asia, after enduring a “dispiriting” meat-and-potatoes meal, Drzal realizes that her husband travels like a turtle, carrying his home with him, while she is a hermit crab, taking on new identities in each place. But there is another man on this trip, a prospective lover she doesn’t yet know is “a hermit crab who crawled into the shells of other people’s marriages.” A lesser writer might have stopped at the dish. CRAVE A Memoir of Food and Longing By Christine S. O’Brien 260 pp. St. Martin’s. $28.99. Image O’Brien’s father is Edgar Scherick, a celebrated producer of television and film. Her mother, Carol, slips from one identity to another, but always ambitiously: The Missouri farm girl morphs into a Miss America pageant finalist, the upper-class New York wife rebels and becomes a natural food devotee. O’Brien and her brothers live in the Dakota and trick-or-treat along the building’s forbidding hallways, getting Tootsie Pops from Lauren Bacall. This is one version of a 20th-century fairy tale. The fable has a dark side. O’Brien’s father is given to terrifying outbursts of anger when under stress, which is often. Her mother suffers from a series of health problems, which she begins managing with food. Embarking on a lifetime of restrictive diets, Carol decides that her family will come along for the ride. Soon the children are put on “The Program” by an unlicensed doctor whose Mafioso clients keep watch on the street lest he be jailed. From then on, the kids are sustained — barely — by blended salads, celery juice, egg yolks and the occasional handful of nuts. It’s remarkable how little anger O’Brien conveys in relating her mother’s disordered approach to eating. The children follow Carol’s instructions more or less obediently, despite being divided from normal society by their inability to enjoy simple treats. When O’Brien caves and eats a Ho Ho, she’s horrified at having “erased my hard work and all the purity” she had worked for. Perfection seems to be the price of her mother’s affection, an exchange that will have lifelong repercussions for O’Brien’s relationship to food. The story drags at times. O’Brien’s father seems always to be “whiny” and “high-pitched” when on the verge of rage. Reading about a diet of puréed vegetables is almost as tiresome as living on one. But O’Brien describes her unusual childhood with loving generosity. She captures her father’s vulnerability and creative brilliance, and recognizes her mother’s pioneering, seeking spirit. After all, this was a woman who embraced Ayurveda, meditation and co-op shopping long before they became mainstream. The family’s story is one of renunciation, but not, ultimately, one of hunger. KITCHEN YARNS Notes on Life, Love, and Food By Ann Hood 232 pp. Norton. $24.95. Image Hood’s essays are like hot chocolate, cozy and warm. Her collection of meditations on food and life touches the big themes: grief for a brother and a small child gone suddenly, two divorces and the end of a grand affair. Still, Hood describes them with the easy intimacy of a friend, confessing her foibles as she stirs a pot of red sauce. The recipes closing each chapter hint that every heartache can be soothed by the deft application of cheese and carbohydrates. Here, unlike in many food memoirs, the recipes carry the story. In some essays, Hood recalls her days as a young woman stumbling into sophistication. She models for the Jordan Marsh department store and flits around the world in a T.W.A. flight attendant uniform designed by Ralph Lauren. The brand names share their retro appeal with the meals she cooks at the time: a curried chicken salad snipped from Glamour, Chicken Salad Veronique, the spaghetti carbonara she falls for on a layover in Rome. These nostalgic foods intuitively convey the fleeting nature of youthful ideals, and how fervently they can be held. Other tales focus on homely simplicity. Hood slips into her Italian-American mother’s kitchen, though she never quite manages to get the knack of rolling out meatballs like Mom does. The accompanying recipe comes with a warning: “Gogo” never measures out her ingredients, and besides, “she always wants her food to be better than yours.” Later, Hood recalls the quiet joy of making weeknight dinner while her children stand on stools beside her and help. The roast potatoes her son improvises are, appropriately, “best made by a child under the age of 10.” The book’s steady cheer might cloy were it not punctuated by loneliness. Hood is at her meditative best while wandering around Ikea, trying to assemble a new life after divorce. The store’s winding paths remind her of the Minotaur’s labyrinth. Instead of a ball of string, however, Hood comes out with a recipe for Swedish meatballs. There is, after all, deliverance in humble things.

arts Queen, Ally and the Alchemy of Musical Stardom on the Big Screen - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Movies Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Movies|Queen, Ally and the Alchemy of Musical Stardom on the Big Screen Supported by Critic’s Notebook Queen, Ally and the Alchemy of Musical Stardom on the Big Screen Image In “Bohemian Rhapsody,” Rami Malek (with Gwilym Lee, left, and Joe Mazzello) misses Freddie Mercury’s eternal self-delight.CreditCreditAlex Bailey/Twentieth Century Fox, via Associated Press By Wesley Morris Jan. 2, 2019 I was waiting for a subway last month in Mexico City when I figured out what’s wrong with the Queen movie. I mean, I knew what was wrong. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is scared of tapping into the imagination that made the band so innovative and powerfully, addictively strange. But that’s not what hit me waiting for the subway. The platform entertainment system was playing a concert video of “Another One Bites the Dust.” I don’t know what year the clip was from or what city Queen was in. I just know that the lighting is warm, the groove is skintight (you could feel it on the platform), and that Freddie Mercury is wearing — is packed into — white short-shorts and almost nothing else. No shoes, no shirt yet all service. The towel he’s whipping around gets an almost immediate, theatrical toss into the crowd. The red wristband and red bandanna tied round his neck bring out the red in his Montreal Canadiens trucker’s cap. Image The real Freddie Mercury, mesmerizing French fans in 1984.CreditJean-Claude Coutausse/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Mercury does all his Mercurial moves — the side gallop, the chug-a-lug, the duck strut, the steed swipe, the rewind, the vroom-vroom, the Wimbledon Final frozen pirouette, the one where he kind of dries his tushy with the microphone stand in a full march. And he does them while belting out this uppercut of a song (with some shockingly forceful assistance from the drummer Roger Taylor). Commuters, tourists, kids: we looked up at this thing, mesmerized, in jeopardy of missing a train. That’s right about when I figured out what was wrong with the Queen movie: There’s nothing in it remotely like this. “Bohemian Rhapsody” plods, explains, obscures, speculates and flattens. It does not mesmerize. I mean, I wouldn’t miss a train for this. We learn how “We Will Rock You” allegedly sprang from a fit of personal protestation. But it’s news we can’t use. The movie won’t stop telling us things — about the music business and the songs, about Mercury’s tortured sex life. And it fails to show you anything close to what that clip on the subway platforms makes you feel: sweaty. The musical biography has an impossibly high degree of alchemical difficulty. One performer has to become a totally different performer, and not any performer, just this one star the whole world knows, and it has to be done in a way that makes you believe you’re seeing either the impersonated star or something quintessential about them. Val Kilmer made you believe you were seeing something vitally true about Jim Morrison. Joaquin Phoenix did the same with Johnny Cash. And Jamie Foxx became Ray Charles. Angela Bassett convinced you that if you were seeing if not Tina Turner, then Turner’s indestructibility; and Marion Cotillard, the brittle incandescence of Edith Piaf. For my money, one of the triumphs of this type of acting is Chadwick Boseman’s James Brown in “Get On Up.” Boseman pumps Brown full of edginess and spite while having to reconstruct Brown as a stage specimen, and part of that reconstruction involves learning to lip sync to Brown. You sense that you’re watching an actor who’s done more than homework. He’s written himself a little dissertation. It’s not an impression of Brown. It’s an interpolation. Video The director Tate Taylor narrates a sequence from “Get On Up,” featuring Chadwick Boseman.Published OnJuly 31, 2014CreditCreditUniversal Pictures Some movies pivot and omit the musical performance altogether. That’s the approach Todd Haynes applied to Bob Dylan in “I’m Not There” and John Ridley took in having Andre 3000 play Jimi Hendrix in “Jimi: All Is by My Side.” But the alchemy is a reason to dislike the genre. It’s hard to get the proportions right. It takes some work in, say, “Cadillac Records” to figure out where Beyoncé ends and Etta James is supposed to begin. Rami Malek has a different challenge in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” He’s not a superstar playing another superstar. He just has to become the superstar Freddie Mercury was. Just. And yet because the movie is mostly scenes of recording sessions, squabbling and self-pity, Mercury’s stardom is made beside the point — it’s assumed — so Malek gets to play a charismatic sufferer, -quipster and, eventually, proud brown gay man. It’s just that this version of Mercury isn’t terribly exciting without the reward of seeing him vroom-vroom in short-shorts. The movie rides the roller coaster of biographical cliché. What’s missing are musical numbers that showcase his showmanship and eternal capacity for self-delight. This means more time watching Malek struggle with dental effects meant to bring his mouth into more realistic alignment with Mercury’s. Maybe Malek has done the best anyone could with the teeth. But they wind up bringing something vampiric out of Mercury that I don’t know was ever there. Either way, the alchemy is off. Image In “A Star Is Born,” Lady Gaga (with Bradley Cooper) shows a lovely hesitance.CreditWarner Bros., via Associated Press WE’RE IN A HAPPY MOMENT for musical-movie excitement. “Mary Poppins” has returned with new songs. And despite that lie of a title, “The Greatest Showman” is the most impressive phenomenon nobody saw coming or took seriously once it came. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is now the musical biopic’s biggest hit. We can have the argument later about the difference between a classical movie musical and a movie where people get on stage and do music, but you could also add to the mix this latest incarnation of “A Star Is Born,” which was a smash too. It’s the story of how a waitress became a Grammy winner. And because the tale is essentially a fantasy — of love, fame and ruin; biography as mythology — its casting is the inverse of the rock bio. A musician does the acting. In Bradley Cooper’s version, the musician is Lady Gaga. She starts off as Ally the restaurant grunt. But when Cooper’s beloved alt-country pill guzzler sees her belt “La Vie en Rose” in a drag parlor, he hauls her into stardom, which Gaga knows well. But the surprise of her acting comes in the first hour when the movie is closer to earth and requires her to be more like you and me — daughter, employee, listener. There’s a lovely hesitance to her here, not in the camera-shy way singers tend to get when it’s time to act. Reluctance is a performance strategy for her in this movie. Again, she’s like you and me, she can’t believe Bradley Cooper’s happening to her, either. Some of what’s great about the first hour is how it gets you thinking about the kind of career Gaga could have in movies they haven’t made in, like, 30 years. Image Lady Gaga with Andrew Dice Clay as her father in the movie.CreditClay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures The scenes at home with Ally, her chauffeur father and his fellow drivers are loud, funny and warm in a way that reminded me of “Moonstruck.” And some of the pleasure I had watching Gaga in them is how she reminded me of another singer who acts: Cher. A friend points out that she could have Cher’s career if the movies were still interested in normal people. I, at least, would love to see Gaga in a “Mask” or a “Suspect.” She and Malek are both near the top of the heap for Oscar nominations. And she’s got an alchemical advantage over Malek’s Freddie Mercury. When Ally’s career takes off, Gaga winds up playing a pop star not unlike herself. And you realize she has the opposite problem that Malek does. You’re less interested in her as a singer — but only because we’ve seen her do huge, stadium-size razzle-dazzle before. And yet she’s indifferent to playing the fame stuff. It doesn’t seem to interest Ally or Gaga. If the movie loses Ally a bit in the second half, Gaga never appears lost. She’s giving a serious, considered, committed performance of a person she seems to know. Malek’s commitment is to a movie committed in the wrong proportions. It doesn’t know who it wants Freddie Mercury to be. “Bohemian Rhapsody” doesn’t fixate on the showmanship until the finale, which restages their electric, legendary Live-Aid performance at Wembly Stadium and passes for showstopping. Yet you exit hungry for a movie that gets closer to the bottom of a man who renamed himself after both an element and a planet. If someone dares take another crack (and someone really should), I know the perfect Freddie. Her first name is Lady. And her last name comes straight from a Queen song.

arts Norman Gimbel, 91, Grammy and Oscar-Winning Lyricist, Is Dead - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Obituaries Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Obituaries|Norman Gimbel, 91, Grammy and Oscar-Winning Lyricist, Is Dead Supported by Norman Gimbel, 91, Grammy and Oscar-Winning Lyricist, Is Dead Image Norman Gimbel, left, and Charles Fox with their Grammy Awards for best song, “Killing Me Softly,” in 1973. “Norman had the extraordinary ability with his lyrics to capture the human condition with never an excessive word to describe a feeling or an action,” Mr. Fox said.CreditCreditCharles Fox Archives By Anita Gates Jan. 1, 2019 Norman Gimbel, the wildly versatile Brooklyn-born lyricist who won a Grammy Award for a blues hit, “Killing Me Softly With His Song”; an Oscar for a folk ballad, “It Goes Like It Goes” (from “Norma Rae”); and television immortality for the bouncy series themes to “Happy Days” and “Laverne and Shirley,” died on Dec. 19 at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 91. The death was confirmed by his son Tony, managing partner of his father’s music publishing company, Words West. Any attempt to categorize the elder Mr. Gimbel’s musical leanings would be complicated. He was famous for the English lyrics of “The Girl From Ipanema,” Antonio Carlos Jobim’s 1964 bossa nova hit originally written in Portuguese. He also wrote English lyrics for Michel Legrand’s music from Jacques Demy’s romantic 1964 French film “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” most notably “I Will Wait for You” (“Till you’re here beside me, till I’m touching you”) and for what became “I Will Follow Him,” a solid hit about teenage adoration sung by Little Peggy March (age 15) in 1963. Among his early hits, “Sway” (“When marimba rhythms start to play”) was clearly Latin-accented, even when Dean Martin sang it, and “Canadian Sunset,” recorded by Andy Williams, became a jazz standard. “Ready to Take a Chance Again” (from “Foul Play,” 1978), which earned an Oscar nomination, was a wistfully hopeful love song. Jim Croce’s 1973 hit “I Got a Name” (“Movin’ me down the highway, rollin’ down the highway, movin’ ahead so life won’t pass me by”) was quintessential folk rock. Mr. Gimbel worked with David Shire on “Norma Rae,” but his most frequent collaborator may have been Charles Fox. “Killing Me Softly,” which brought Mr. Gimbel and Mr. Fox the song-of-the-year Grammy after Roberta Flack released it in 1973, had a conflict-ridden back story. Lori Lieberman, a California bistro singer, had recorded the song first (Mr. Fox and Mr. Gimbel were her producers and managers) and she said that the lyrics (among them, “I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud”) had been based on a poem she had written about attending an emotionally stirring Don McLean concert. The song, which became a hit again with the Fugees’ hip-hop cover in the 1990s, is now sometimes listed as written “in collaboration with” Ms. Lieberman. Norman Gimbel was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 16, 1927. His parents — Morris Gimbel, who was in the restaurant business, and Lottie (Nass) Gimbel — were Jewish immigrants from Austria. Norman, who studied English at Baruch College and Columbia University, began his career working for the music publisher David Blum and for Edwin H. Morris & Company. His first hit was “Ricochet,” written with Larry Coleman and Joe Darion and recorded by Teresa Brewer in 1953. The saucy, country-tinged pop song (“If you’re careless with your kisses, find another turtle dove”) rose to No. 2 on the charts. Mr. Gimbel soon moved to Los Angeles, where he worked more widely in television and film, teaming up with Mr. Fox on the themes to the hit sitcoms “Laverne and Shirley” (“Schlemiel, schlimazle, Hassenpfeffer Incorporated”) and “Happy Days” (“Sunday, Monday, happy days”) and the 1970s series “Wonder Woman” and “The Paper Chase.” He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984. Back in New York, Mr. Gimbel wrote lyrics for two Broadway musicals, “Whoop-Up” (1958) and “The Conquering Hero” (1961), working with the composer Moose Charlap. The first show, set on an American Indian reservation, earned two Tony nominations; the second, starring Tom Poston as a fake war hero, had a book by Larry Gelbart. Despite positive reviews, both musicals flopped at the box office and closed early. Both of Mr. Gimbel’s marriages, to the fashion model Elinor Rowley and to Victoria Carver, a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to his son Tony, survivors include another son, Peter; two daughters, Nelly Gimbel and Hannah Gimbel Dal Pozzo; and four grandchildren. Mr. Gimbel gave relatively few interviews. In a six-minute segment as a contestant (alongside Burt Bacharach and Jerry Leiber) on “Play Your Hunch,” an early Merv Griffin game show, he spoke only three words. That verbal reticence, though, served him well professionally. “Norman had the extraordinary ability with his lyrics to capture the human condition with never an excessive word to describe a feeling or an action,” Mr. Fox, the composer, said in a statement after his writing partner’s death. He went on to praise Mr. Gimbel’s ability to conjure an entire song with its first line, and he offered examples: “Tall and tan and young and lovely.” “Strumming my pain with his fingers.” “If it takes forever, I will wait for you.” Correction:  An earlier version of this obituary misstated the year the movie “Foul Play” was released. It was 1978, not 1998. Correction:  An earlier version of this obituary misstated the year of the Broadway musical “The Conquering Hero,” for which Mr. Gimbel wrote the lyrics and Moose Charlap wrote the music.

arts Apple Shuns the Tech Industry’s Apology Tour - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Technology Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Technology|Apple Shuns the Tech Industry’s Apology Tour Supported by State of the Art Apple Shuns the Tech Industry’s Apology Tour Image Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, onstage Monday at its developers conference. While he said that “we might not even recognize how distracted we’ve become” by the digital world, Apple announced advances like a feature that turns faces into emoji.CreditCreditJason Henry for The New York Times By Farhad Manjoo June 4, 2018 Leer en español SAN JOSE, Calif. — Sorry, Apple’s not sorry. There has been a theme at the tech industry’s big conferences this year: Facebook and other tech giants keep telling us that they’ve learned from their mistakes and are going to be a lot more thoughtful about the far-out stuff they plan on doing in the future. Apple has been cool to this narrative, and it was striking how the company’s executives danced around the tech backlash story line from the stage on Monday at its annual conference for developers. Though Apple acknowledged the darker side of society’s obsession with the digital world, it didn’t go anywhere near the idea that its own technology might bear any of the blame. Apple did announce several new ways of letting adults and children limit how much time they spend on their phones. A tool called Screen Time, for example, is meant to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps. And parents will be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones. Image A new tool, Screen Time, is meant to help users limit the time they spend on their iPhones.CreditJason Henry for The New York Times Apple’s software chief, Craig Federighi, said the company felt it was time to address smartphones’ oversize impact on everyday life. “For some of us, it’s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we’ve become,” he said. These features looked quite handy — we will know for sure once they’re released to users this year. If they do push users to quit wasting so much time on Facebook and YouTube (where getting people to waste time is a big part of the business plan), they are sure to roil Apple’s relationship with others in tech. But that is not Apple’s problem; it is more concerned about selling you a new phone. Apple is also putting considerable resources into making its Watch stand apart from its phone, a direction that in the long run will create more opportunities to go without a phone. Are you wearing an Apple Watch instead of carrying an iPhone? In time, Apple may not care. But at its event here, Apple’s support for what’s being called “digital well-being” often awkwardly butted up against Apple’s larger goal: to make the digital world so awesome, you can’t resist it. The next iPhone will let you turn your face into an emoji, and now it can even do “tongue detection” — an animated version of your face can stick out its tongue when you do. With Apple’s new augmented reality system, the iPhone can turn Legos into a video game. But if you can’t even play with some Legos without reaching for your phone, isn’t that kind of a problem? Apple wants to stand apart from the techlash with its emphasis on privacy and its oft-stated distaste for the excesses of the internet ad industry. On Monday, the company said its Safari web browser would disable tracking software, or cookies, that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users’ activity across the internet. The new Safari feature is a direct swipe at the data-collection practices of big internet companies that Apple has tried hard to separate itself from. Apple argues that it has always been one of the more high-minded of the big tech companies, so it shouldn’t be lumped in with outfits like Facebook. But that argument has always been a little complicated. Apple benefits from our obsession with social software; people buy its powerful phones to use Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year for the privilege of being the iPhone’s default search engine. “We aim to put the customer at the center of everything we do,” Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said several times Monday. That seemed like a promise as well as a backhanded defense. Apple will give you the world. What you do with it is your own problem.

arts ‘There There’ Is an Energetic Revelation of a Corner of American Life - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|‘There There’ Is an Energetic Revelation of a Corner of American Life Supported by Books of The Times ‘There There’ Is an Energetic Revelation of a Corner of American Life By Dwight Garner June 4, 2018 Image CreditCreditAlessandra Montalto/The New York Times A modest proposal: Can publishers list a writer’s depravities on the back flaps of their books, so we know where we stand? The Native American writer Sherman Alexie’s depravities — he allegedly used his fame to lure women into unwanted sexual situations — have landed him among the New Unmentionables of our country’s literature. His blurb was understandably pulled from the front cover of “There There,” Tommy Orange’s powerful first novel, and swapped on the finished book with one from Margaret Atwood. In his acknowledgments, Orange thanks Alexie “for how he helped this become a better novel, and for all the unbelievable support he’s given me once the book was bought.” Until we can hold a national plebiscite on whether future generations should be taught to spit at the mention of his name, Alexie’s assistance in the birth of this novel is worth noting for a single reason. “There There” has so much jangling energy and brings so much news from a distinct corner of American life that it’s a revelation in a way that’s reminiscent of the best of Alexie’s early work. In terms of sheer brio and promise, its appearance marks the passing of a generational baton. “There There” is set in Oakland, Calif., where Orange — he’s an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma — was born and raised. The title refers to Gertrude Stein’s comment about there being no “there there” in Oakland. Orange makes note of a Radiohead song with this title as well. His novel is about urban Indians, about whom he writes, in his bravura prologue, “We know the sound of the freeway better than we do rivers, the howl of distant trains better than wolf howls, we know the smell of gas and freshly wet concrete and burned rubber better than we do the smell of cedar or sage or even fry bread.” Orange deals out the stories of 12 characters, many of them related, as their lives move toward an event called the Big Oakland Powwow. One will dance there; another will be an emcee. Others will wander and eat and gawk. One will fly a drone over the festivities from his nearby house, providing eerie and cold-eyed perspective. Others will smuggle in handguns. Not insignificantly, these guns are white. They’ve been cast by a 3-D printer. The working idea is to rob the powwow to get out from under a drug-related debt. Out in the parking lot, bumpers and rear windows are stamped with stickers: “My Other Vehicle Is a War Pony”; “Fighting Terrorism Since 1492”; “Custer Had It Coming.” The story Orange tells moves cinematically in its second half, sweeping up all that came before. To film it properly would require a Robert Altman, a director with an unorthodox sense of spectacle. It might also require a director willing to tinker with Orange’s expedient Grand Guignol ending, one less willing to simply burn the set down. Image Tommy OrangeCreditChristopher Thompson for The New York Times What’s impressive about Orange’s writing isn’t its pacing, though a strong current of physical and emotional movement, especially when a story is told through many braided stories, is nothing to undervalue. You feel that, if he wanted to move in that direction, he could be a subtle and major writer of crime fiction, another Walter Mosley. He knows what to do when there is a gun on the table. It’s the close-up work that puts this novel across, however, the quotidian details of blasted lives. That Orange manages to link these details to a historical sense of outrage at how America has treated its native people, in a manner that approaches scarifying essay without dropping over the fence into lecture or sociology, adds to this novel’s smoke. The first character we meet is Tony Loneman, a young man born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. He calls it the Drome. “There’s too much space between each of the parts of my face — eyes, nose, mouth, spread out like a drunk slapped it on reaching for another drink.” His I.Q. is in the lowest percentile, but he knows what he knows. He factors mightily in this novel’s ending. Another character is Orvil Red Feather, who was brought up with so little sense of his heritage that he had to absorb it all virtually, from “watching hours and hours of powwow footage, documentaries on YouTube, by reading all that there was to read on sites like Wikipedia, PowWows.com, and Indian Country Today.” Orange is especially interested in what cultural inheritance means, in how to carry your roots like a conscience, in what one needs to leave behind and what one needs to take. “The problem with Indigenous art in general is that it’s stuck in the past,” one character says. “The catch, or the double bind, about the whole thing is this: If it isn’t pulling from tradition, how is it Indigenous?” Orvil puts it this way, about the impulse to dress up to look Indian: “There’s something like the shaking of feathers he felt somewhere between his heart and his stomach.” This novel’s most fully realized characters might be two women, the estranged half sisters Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield and Jacquie Red Feather. They shared a hard childhood with a mother who was often beaten. “Home for Jacquie and her sister was a locked station wagon in an empty parking lot. Home was a long ride on a bus.” Jacquie, who is now covered with scars and tattoos, disappeared first into the juvenile detention system and then into alcoholism. Her shot at redemption, her long road trip to the powwow, is among this novel’s richest threads. “There There” has its soft spots. At times it veers toward the sentimental; it can lean too heavily on its themes. There are perhaps too many resonant generalities about the importance of storytelling. But the real stuff is here, a sense of life as it is lived, an awareness of the worm inside each bottle of mezcal. Orange leads you across the drawbridge, and then the span starts going up.

arts ‘Game of Thrones’ Does Not Say What Donald Trump Thinks It Does - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|‘Game of Thrones’ Does Not Say What Donald Trump Thinks It Does Supported by Critic’s Notebook ‘Game of Thrones’ Does Not Say What Donald Trump Thinks It Does Image President Trump has shown a fondness for “Game of Thrones”-inspired memes.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York Times By James Poniewozik Jan. 4, 2019 President Trump, as his Twitter feed amply demonstrates, is more of a Fox News guy than an HBO guy. It’s too bad. Mornings might be less stressful if the president spent them opining on “My Brilliant Friend” rather than on “Fox & Friends.” But he has lately developed an affinity for one of HBO’s shows. Or at least its advertising. In November, announcing sanctions on Iran, the president tweeted out a picture of himself on a mock “Game of Thrones” promo, with the caption “Sanctions Are Coming,” a variation on the show’s tagline “Winter Is Coming.” He apparently liked the image so much that he bought the poster. A copy lay in front of him at his Cabinet meeting Wednesday. Thursday, on his Instagram account, he rolled out the sequel: “The Wall Is Coming,” with the president giving an Ice King stare over a rendering of a spiky barrier. On Trump’s Instagram pic.twitter.com/PQaWp86ZPQ— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) January 3, 2019 It was, superficially, an apt use of imagery. HBO’s epic does feature a massive border wall, stretching across the border wastes of the fantasy realm of Westeros. The slight problem — spoiler alert for anyone who isn’t caught up, including, apparently, the entire White House staff — is that at the end of the most recent season that wall spectacularly collapsed, done in by the (blue) fire and fury of a zombie dragon. But there’s a bigger dissonance than that. Mr. Trump is a fan of tough-guy imagery, and he, or whoever makes his memes, probably just liked the idea of depicting himself as the patriarch of House Trump — First of His Name, Protector of the Realm — going medieval on national security. However, he might not like what “Game of Thrones” actually has to say about leadership in general, and walls in particular. Certainly Mr. Trump could find role models on the show. It involves the rise to dominance of a cunning, wealthy family that doles out power positions to relatives and has a penchant for gold. (Although there is some question as to whether Mr. Trump, like the Lannisters, pays his debts.) And yes, looming over the whole thing, there is — or was — a great, big, beautiful wall. But it was never intended to keep out people. In the story, based on a book series by George R.R. Martin, the ice wall was built thousands of years ago, with magical assistance, to keep out the White Walkers (the “Others” in the novels), a race of frigid beings dedicated to snuffing out all life. (I’ll let you Google the details.) [Plan ahead for the season to come with our culture calendar.] But as the Walkers lay dormant for centuries, people in Westeros started to forget. This nightmare enemy of all mankind, they decided, was a fairy tale. Instead, they came to believe, the wall was there to protect the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros from the “wildlings” — their term for the poor suckers who happened to live on the desolate northern side of the wall when it went up. Over generations, the Night’s Watch — the force created to patrol the Wall — changed its self-image too, thinking of itself as a kind of border patrol, an icebound I.C.E., there to defend Westeros from what it saw as savages who wanted to pour over the border and steal the riches of honest, hardworking Westerosi. If you’ve watched “Game of Thrones,” you know where it goes from there. The Walkers rise again, and the Night’s Watch leader Jon Snow (Kit Harington) wants to make common cause with the wildlings. “They were born on the wrong side of the wall,” he says. “That doesn’t make them monsters.” His comrades, declaring this fake news, stab him to death. (Only temporarily!) But by the most recent season, with the zombie army encroaching, a resurrected Jon has convinced the squabbling armies of Westeros to pause their war for the Iron Throne — sort of — to fight the undead. In “Game of Thrones,” in other words, nationalism and tribalism are not essential forces for preserving society but an existential threat to survival. The Wall is a mighty symbol of protection but ultimately an ineffective one; the only salvation, if there is one, is people deciding they have more to gain by working together. And the worst leaders (if sometimes the most successful) are those like Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), who see disaster as an opportunity to decimate and divide rivals. The president is a creation of TV and a voracious consumer of it, but his tastes are limited and specific. He likes cable news in general, and news about himself best of all. He became a star in reality TV, which relies on condensing human experience into catchphrases and simple, broad symbols, and he applied its lessons on the campaign trail by rendering the idea of security as a great big wall. He has never, however, seemed to be much of a follower of scripted TV dramas, which at their best draw out life’s complexities. So to him — or the social-media staff in charge of realizing his worldview — “Winter Is Coming,” the motto of House Stark, is a macho threat. (Better look out, sucker! I’m bringing some winter down on you!) As any fan of the series knows, it’s not; it’s a warning, a caution, a reminder that if we fall into pettiness and division, the storm will come for us all, all the same.

arts White Cube? These 3 Art Shows Buck Convention - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|White Cube? These 3 Art Shows Buck Convention Supported by LAST CHANCE White Cube? These 3 Art Shows Buck Convention Small spaces, even smaller budgets and abundant creativity: At three downtown galleries, artists aren’t simply showing their work. Image A video, “GTG TTYL,” by Klara Liden, plays on a small flat-screen monitor in a hidden room at Reena Spaulings.CreditCreditKlara Liden and Reena Spaulings Fine Art By Roberta Smith Jan. 3, 2019 Art galleries, especially those on the Lower East Side and its environs, can sometimes resemble found objects. Art dealers with shoestring budgets take the spaces as they are, or close to it. At the same time, artists often do more than simply show their work in them; they tweak them or execute substantial makeovers that temporarily turn the galleries into part of the art. Such shows are nearly always on view somewhere in New York’s sprawling gallery scene, and at the moment there are three very fine examples within a short distance of one another in downtown Manhattan. Reena Spaulings Fine Art ‘Klara Liden: Grounding’ Image Kara Liden’s 2018 video “Grounding,” in which the artist is seen striding around the Wall Street section of Manhattan, regularly falling and picking herself up again and again.CreditKlara Liden and Reena Spaulings Fine Art; Joerg Lohse Image “Grounding” is projected onto a large slanting wall of plywood, which is sometimes visible through the video image. CreditJoerg Lohse Klara Liden’s latest show at Reena Spaulings — excellent as usual — folds together exterior and interior space, activating both through performance and an invasive video screen. The centerpiece is “Grounding,” a short video beautifully shot by Daniel Garcia, that shows the artist striding around the Wall Street section of Manhattan with what seems to be serious, perhaps even heroic, intent. Looking neither right nor left, she falls regularly, picks herself up and carries on. Whatever mission she’s on never comes into focus; the suspense, encouraged by the pulsing drone of Askar Brickman’s soundtrack, is reduced to anticipating the next fall. The video becomes a parody of masculinity or action films or movie-star heroes — all suggestions aided by Ms. Liden’s androgynous presence and impeccable posture (think of Matt Damon in “The Bourne Identity”) and also undermined by her unwavering dignity. At the gallery, “Grounding” is projected onto a large wall of cheap plywood, angled at about 45 degrees. (The grain is sometimes visible through the image.) This architectural intervention also evokes the way the ground seems to rise to meet you when you fall. Another video, this one on a small, flat-screen monitor, awaits on the other side of a trapdoor-like opening in the plywood wall. Even briefer than “Grounding,” it is titled “GTG TTYL” and shows Ms. Liden performing three simple acts of disappearance within the gallery itself. She hides, or takes cover, by climbing behind the gallery’s sofa, then a false wall and, finally, a large video screen. These short actions are each segmented into split-second moments that are isolated by the monitor’s going dark — interruptions like the falls in “Grounding.” The result is unexpectedly mysterious: choreographed stealth extended, through video, into oddly graceful, deconstructed dance.

Tramps ‘Kai Althoff: Chief Plate Rattler’ Image An installation view of Kai Althoff's show at Tramps, made up of about 10 glass-walled offices on the second floor of a mall in Chinatown. CreditKai Althoff and Tramps; Mark Woods Image An untitled 2018 oil on linen is among the nearly 40 small works on view in Mr. Althoff's latest show.CreditKai Althoff and Tramps The German artist Kai Althoff is showing nearly 40 works, mostly small, characteristically strange paintings, in the warren of about 10 glass-walled offices that constitutes the gallery Tramps, on the second floor of a mall in Chinatown. Mr. Althoff has altered the vitrine-like display spaces, covering the floors with destabilizing sheets of heavy paper over slabs of foam, and the walls with more heavy paper, rice paper and raw cotton. He sometimes paints the paper deep mauve or adds brushwork to the glass. The result is a space that evokes alternating feelings of being oppressed and of being cosseted. The paintings are fantastic and feral, both in execution and in suggested narrative; attenuated, often adolescent, sometimes gnomelike creatures populate them. The scenes often seem to illustrate, or at least conjure European, Japanese or Russian folk tales or children’s stories, reminding us that once upon a time such narratives were often violent, intended to warn the young against bad behavior. There are benign scenes, like that of a group hanging up laundry outdoors, or one of a Buddhist teaching acolytes, as well as a series of images of women giving birth. Surfaces are deliberately murky, but careful examination clarifies both the goings-on and the artist’s eccentric paint handling (often more drawing than painting). Japanese screens; Degas’s monotypes of brothels; Vuillard’s fraught, richly colored surfaces; and Klimt’s lavish patterns may come to mind. But Mr. Althoff’s best efforts reveal larger, more ambiguous and dangerous worlds, full of life’s inescapable tensions, if not its sorrows.

Campbell funeral home from different angles, in different seasons, at different times of day. Creditvia 56 HENRY Image In works like “Frank E. Campbell (February Thaw),” 2018, Talmadge’s technique resembles the pointillism of the Post-Impressionist painter Georges Seurat.Creditvia 56 HENRY For Cynthia Talmadge’s first show at 56 Henry in 2017, her interest in social ritual led her to conflate college residence halls and private rehab centers: She accoutered dorm-room-like displays, such as Ikea might mount, with pennants, tote bags and sweatshirts emblazoned with the names of treatment facilities like McLean and Hazelden. Now she has turned to the prestigious Frank E. Campbell funeral home in Manhattan, known for celebrating the lives and deaths of New York’s rich and famous at its Upper East Side address, which gives the show its title. Like Monet painting the Rouen Cathedral, Ms. Talmadge has painted the funeral home’s facade from different angles, in different seasons, at different times of day. But she has sidestepped Impressionism’s speedy improvisation for an implicitly static style: the dot-by-dot pointillism of the Post-Impressionist painter Georges Seurat, a method that has all the deliberation and precision of a funeral director preparing a corpse for an open coffin. We see the funeral chapel looking pinkish in the bleaching light of summer, and much darker during a nighttime snowstorm (an especially good rendition). With equal skill, Ms. Talmadge has given 56 Henry’s tiny space the high-end look and hush of a funeral parlor. A thick, pale carpet covers the floor; other additions include wainscoting and molding, silk wallpaper and velvet trim, and silk cords from which the paintings hang — all a single shade of tasteful, soothing jade green. Nothing says money like total color coordination, but none of this would look good if Ms. Talmadge’s pointillism weren’t so convincing, down to the painted frames. It should be lost on no one that the production values here aren’t much different from those lavished upon a conventional white-cube gallery, which is a far cry from the stops on this particular tour.

arts David Chase on ‘The Sopranos,’ Trump and, Yes, That Ending - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|David Chase on ‘The Sopranos,’ Trump and, Yes, That Ending Supported by David Chase on ‘The Sopranos,’ Trump and, Yes, That Ending Image David Chase in his Upper East Side apartment. “I didn’t think that ‘The Sopranos’ would chart any kind of new course,” he said. “All I wanted to do is just get as close to cinema as I could.”CreditCreditDevin Yalkin for The New York Times By Jeremy Egner Jan. 7, 2019 “‘Remember when’ is the lowest form of conversation,” Tony Soprano once told his mob cohorts in “The Sopranos.” If David Chase, Tony’s creator, doesn’t totally agree with that assessment — “It was a friend of mine in high school who said that,” he said — that doesn’t mean he’s particularly fond of nostalgic reminiscence. “It’s a cheap thing. It drives me crazy,” he said last week. “I thought revisiting the show would be more pleasurable, but it turns out I’ve forgotten a lot more than I thought I would.” Alas, it’s unavoidable this month. Thursday is the 20th anniversary of the premiere of “The Sopranos” on HBO, a moment that, as much as anything, signaled the beginning of TV’s still-flourishing era of ambitious storytelling and artistic credibility. An immediate sensation — in 1999 The Times said “it just may be the greatest work of American popular culture of the last quarter century” — “The Sopranos” demonstrated that viewers would embrace unconventional TV shows, setting the table for what has become known as “prestige TV.” There had been complex, challenging series before it, like “Twin Peaks,” “The X-Files” and “NYPD Blue.” But over six seasons on HBO, Chase’s offbeat story of the depressed, violent but oddly sympathetic mob boss Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini (who died in 2013), dramatically expanded the parameters of series television, enlacing its sometimes shockingly brutal mob tale with slapstick comedy, surrealist dream logic and narrative invention. Phrases like “the Russian in the woods” and “the cut to black” became a kind of pop-cultural shorthand for an uncompromising, auteurist approach to TV making that has informed not just other antihero stories like “Breaking Bad” or “The Shield,” but also a diverse array of singular series like “Mad Men,” “Transparent” and “Atlanta.” “I didn’t think that ‘The Sopranos’ would chart any kind of new course,” Chase said. “All I wanted to do is just get as close to cinema as I could.” In the time since “The Sopranos” cut to black in 2007, Chase made the period rock ’n’ roll film “Not Fade Away” and wrote other shows and films that have yet to see the light of day. After years of resisting mob-show pitches, he is now working on a “Sopranos” prequel feature film called “The Many Saints of Newark,” which will be set in the title city in the 1960s and involve the father of Christopher Moltisanti (the “Sopranos” character played by Michael Imperioli). It will likely come out in 2020, Chase said. Sitting in his Upper East Side apartment a few feet from his writing desk, Chase was terse but thoughtful and accommodating as he looked back on “The Sopranos,” his gruff demeanor spiked with dry wit. In edited excerpts from that and an earlier conversation for an upcoming video project for The New York Times, he discussed the legacy of “The Sopranos,” how A.J. (Robert Iler) might fit within the Trump White House and, yes, the endlessly dissected finale. Image James Gandolfini, left, and Chase on the set of “Not Fade Away,” Chase’s 2012 film about a 1960s rock ’n’ roll band.CreditBarry Wetcher/Paramount Vantage “The Sopranos” was originally conceived as a film, right? Yeah. I planned to have Robert De Niro as, well he didn’t have a name, and Anne Bancroft as his mother. But I was signing with a new agency and they said mob comedies were dead, so I should forget about that. As it turned out, they had missed their mark. You’ve talked about how your mother and your relationship with her inspired certainly the early part of “The Sopranos.” But what were some of the other ingredients? When the show first hit the air, I really overdid it in the press about my childhood. I said I was always depressed and this and that, because I wanted to sell the idea of Tony and depression. Actually, my mother was pretty crazy. But I had a wonderful childhood in many ways. I was really cared for. I was ranging all over the place in this apartment complex that we lived in, just discovering everything. I had good friends. How much of that found its way into the show? One thing that did was this attraction to nature. The bear. The woods. Ducks. The ducks. Because even in Clifton, N.J., there was a lot of wildlife around then. There isn’t very much anymore. The film I always mention, that informed what I was trying to do, is “Saps at Sea,” a Laurel and Hardy thing. Why did you want to do a mob show, specifically? I was Italian-American, and I wanted to see Italian-Americans portrayed. Now these people would say, “You didn’t portray Italians as they are. All Italians are not gangsters.” That was true for the show, too. Dr. Melfi [Lorraine Bracco] wasn’t a gangster. Other people they ran into were not gangsters. But the main characters were. How did James Gandolfini shape Tony in ways that you perhaps did not anticipate? The first day we were shooting, there was a scene in which Christopher told Tony that he was going to write a movie script and go to Hollywood. And in the dialogue, Tony said, “What are you, crazy?” and he gives him a love tap. That’s what I pictured. And we came to do it, and Jim pulled him out of his chair, shook him by the collar and was like “Are you [expletive] crazy?” And I thought: That’s Tony Soprano. He just felt like a real gangster. You worked in traditional broadcast television for decades, on shows like “The Rockford Files” and “Northern Exposure.” What specific TV conventions were you trying to break out of with “The Sopranos”? Really all of them. I hated commercials and the way they interrupted everything. I wanted to slow the pace of the episode down or speed it up, as we wanted to. Language. I wanted to create characters that felt like real people and behave the way people behave, which I didn’t see on network television. How did you go about it? I always had this saying: The first 10 ideas you get, throw them away. And that’s what we used to do, is to just keep going until it was something you hadn’t seen before or couldn’t anticipate. Image Michael Imperioli, left, and Tony Sirico in the “Pine Barrens” episode of “The Sopranos.” Chase said some of the series’ best moments came when “someone was out of their element.”CreditBarry Wetcher/HBO The show became famous both for surprising resolutions — like when Janice Soprano [Aida Turturro] killed Richie Aprile [David Proval] in Season 2 — and things left unresolved, like the infamous Russian in the woods in the “Pine Barrens” episode. What did those kinds of swerves bring to the story? My wife’s grandfather was from France and he fought in World War I — he was gassed in the war. He had two sons, and when the war was over he came to the United States because he didn’t want them to be around war, and he didn’t want them to go into the army. And then they both went into the Army here in the United States. I thought about that all the time and I think that’s what life is like. You prepare and prepare for things. “I am going to take charge of something. I’m going to avoid all that.” And it comes from some other side — you never see it. That’s a lifelike thing, and that’s what we were trying to do. Was there an early moment or episode when you had a breakthrough? I think “College” broke through something for me, the fifth episode of the first season. When Tony took his daughter on a college tour [and brutally killed a former mobster turned snitch along the way]. Some of the best episodes were ones where he was out of his element, or someone was out of their element. “Pine Barrens.” They were like little movies, which is what I was always trying to do: A little movie every week. I wasn’t fond of the idea of doing continuing stories. Why not? I don’t know. I thought about “Dallas” — I didn’t want to do that. But I let myself be convinced to do them and it turned out to be a really good idea. Were there any episodes you wish you could do over? The show when they went to Italy. That really wasn’t our element. We really didn’t know what we were talking about, so I didn’t like it as much. What about the maligned episode about the Columbus Day Parade protest? I don’t regret it, because I had so much vitriol piled up inside me that I didn’t care whether people liked it or not. I know everybody hates it. [Laughs.] As an Italian-American yourself, were you hurt by the criticism of the show’s depictions of Italian-Americans? No, I wasn’t. It just got me lathered up, that’s all. In “The Sopranos” there were a lot of things that weren’t found in other mob presentations, and it pissed me off that people were kind of blind to that. We were supposed to shoot “Pine Barrens” in South Mountain Reservation in New Jersey, and an Essex County executive kicked us out because we were such a lousy example of Italians. Then later he went to prison. [Laughs.] Did you know from the beginning that the show would incorporate more impressionistic elements, like the dream sequences? Things like the Big Pussy fish dream or the Kevin Finnerty alt-reality arc in Season 6? A lot of people hated those dream sequences. There were people who just wanted a mob show, and their motto was “less yakking, more whacking.” And when I would read things like that, it would only make me do more yakking. Look, the show was about psychiatry, and dreams are part of psychiatry. Edie Falco jokes about wanting to bring the show back, with Carmela as the boss of the family. Has anyone ever seriously tried to get you to resurrect it in some form? No. People approached me about doing more mob stuff, but not “The Sopranos.” Really? I would have guessed Netflix would have backed up the Brink’s truck and said, “How much will it take?” Nope. Never happened. What would it take? To bring it back? I wouldn’t do it. At the end, we were done. I was done. Image Gandolfini with Edie Falco, who played Tony Soprano’s wife, Carmela.CreditCraig Blankenhorn/HBO I recall from interviews from then that Gandolfini was pretty done, too. Oh yeah, he was really done. He was done with me. He starred in “Not Fade Away” later, though. Did you guys get along, in general? We got along, but toward the end of “The Sopranos” he was tired of it and he was tired of me. And I was tired of his foibles. That’s all. He used to call me a vampire. Then he started calling all the writers vampires, because we used to take the real lives of the cast and put it in the show. Like Tony Sirico was germophobic, so we gave that to Paulie. We talked about dreams earlier. Do you ever dream about “The Sopranos”? No, I dream about Jim Gandolfini. I really don’t remember them that well and I never analyzed them. Maybe he is Tony Soprano in some of them. He’s angry in a lot of them. [Laughs.] What do you think “The Sopranos” did that television hasn’t done before? [Long pause.] I think “The Sopranos” showed humans more as humans than what had come before it. I mean, on network television those are human beings, certainly. But I think more people could feel like “Tony Soprano is more like me than a doctor, or a cop, or a judge.” Since “The Sopranos,” TV has become perhaps the most creatively fertile and ambitious pop-culture medium. Do you take any satisfaction from the fact that you were one of the architects of that? If you say so. But yeah, I take satisfaction that I had some effect on the way things changed. I did want to change things. There is an Elvis Costello song where he says, “I want to bite the hand that feeds me; I want to bite that hand so badly.” That’s the way I always felt about working at the networks, and I think I did it. Image “It was a pleasurable sensation that people were talking about it, that it made an impression on people,” Chase said of the “Sopranos” finale. “It made a lot of people angry.”CreditDevin Yalkin for The New York Times What “Sopranos” influences do you see when you watch television? The use of a deeply flawed hero and his problems. And when news shows talk about Trump, for example, they’ll say it’s like “The Sopranos.” People, including your own paper, use “The Sopranos” as an example of crookedness and culpability. I don’t watch a lot of series television. Unfortunately what I do is spend my time watching CNN, Fox and MSNBC. So I get good and depressed, and angry. I’d forgotten, until I rewatched it recently, that in the finale A.J. talks about wanting to work as a helicopter pilot for Trump. Had that worked out, he might be part of the administration now. He might be the new chief of staff. He’d be buddy-buddy with Stephen Miller, I know that. What do you think Tony would have made of Trump becoming president? He would think the guy was full of [expletive]. Whether he thought he was a good president or not — I don’t know that Tony thought much about that question at all, with anybody who was in office. But I know Tony would have thought Trump was penny-ante, in terms of his lying and presentation. Of course, the finale is best remembered for the cut to black and all the commentary that followed. Would you have done anything differently had you known you’d get asked about it for years? I don’t think so. You couldn’t help but be surprised — beyond surprised — at the response. It was a pleasurable sensation that people were talking about it, that it made an impression on people. It made a lot of people angry. Sometimes I couldn’t believe it was that important to people. With the 20th anniversary coming, are you ready for another round of “Is Tony dead or not?” I’ve got to say I’m just bored with it. I also feel like, Jesus, there were 86 episodes and you’re fixated on that? Can’t we talk about something else? You did an interview with the Directors Guild of America in 2015 that extensively broke down the final sequence. Was that an attempt to just put the whole thing to bed? Might have been. I really don’t recall my reasons. I was trying to provide a context. Is it frustrating that even after that, many people don’t seem to want to take you at your word? It’s frustrating. It makes me use bad words. But it’s not surprising, you know? And I don’t have any statistics to prove it, but I think it’s become more accepted as time has gone on. I think the point isn’t whether or not Tony was killed. It’s the uncertainty that’s the point, and the way the scene’s crazy tension makes us aware of the passage of time and how choices shape the brief bit of life we get. Most people can’t control when or how they die, but the choices are ours. Is that totally off base? No, that’s not off base at all. I think there’s some hope in it. You’re the first person who’s said that. There is some hope in it. “Don’t Stop Believin’” is the name of the song, for Christ’s sake. I mean, what else can you say? Is there a correct answer to the question of whether Tony is alive or dead? I don’t think so. I don’t think so.

What’s on TV MY BRILLIANT FRIEND 9 p.m. on HBO; also streaming on HBO platforms. HBO’s intimate adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s first Neapolitan novel closes out its first season, which the critic James Poniewozik of The New York Times designated a Critic’s Pick. Directed by the Italian filmmaker Saverio Costanzo, the show largely focuses on the best friends Lenù (Margherita Mazzucco) and Lila (Gaia Girace) as they stumble through a tumultuous adolescence in a poor and violent neighborhood in post-World War II Naples. The finale, like most of the season, finds the girls trying to harness power in situations that leave them largely powerless to the forces (or men) around them: Lenù is kicked out of her high school class for voicing her opinion, and Lila butts heads with her suitor, Stefano, on decisions regarding her family’s shoe business. CMA COUNTRY CHRISTMAS 8 p.m. on ABC. Reba McEntire returns for a second year to host this holiday music special. The two-hour event features performances by Amy Grant, Martina McBride, Brad Paisley and more, as well as a special duet by Tony Bennett and Diana Krall. PENTATONIX: A NOT SO SILENT NIGHT 10 p.m. on NBC. If you’re still in the mood for Christmas music after the CMA special, or if country just isn’t your thing, the five-member a cappella group Pentatonix has a holiday special that follows the singers along the Las Vegas Strip. As they stop to perform at some of that city’s landmarks, they will be joined by Kelly Clarkson, the Backstreet Boys, Maren Morris and the illusionists Penn & Teller. VICE SPECIAL REPORT: PANIC: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS 10 p.m. on HBO; also streaming on HBO platforms. Ten years after the United States’ worst financial crisis since the Depression, Vice sat down with Barack Obama and George W. Bush to discuss what went wrong, and what unfolded behind the scenes to keep the economy from collapse. Ben Bernanke, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve; Timothy Geithner, then president of the Federal Bank of New York; and Henry Paulson, who was the Treasury secretary, also discuss their combined effort to avert a financial catastrophe. What’s Streaming Image Michael Fassbender, center, plays an eccentric bandleader, alongside Maggie Gyllenhaal and Domhnall Gleeson in Lenny Abrahamson’s “Frank.”CreditLorey Sebastian/Sundance Institute, via Associated Press FRANK (2014) on Sundance Now, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube and Vudu. Before Lenny Abrahamson made his film “Room,” he directed this movie about the bandleader of an experimental musical group who wears a papier-mâché mask over his head. The premise may sound absurd, but it’s based on the story of the pop star Frank Sidebottom, as written by the journalist Jon Ronson, who played keyboard in Sidebottom’s band. The plot makes for a delightfully fun film that’s also an honest look at creative genius and madness. In his review, The Times critic A. O. Scott said that “Frank” was “an accumulation of memorably offbeat moments, like an album made up of B sides and lost demo tracks that you stumble across and can’t stop replaying.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C7 of the New York edition with the headline: What’s On Monday.

arts Chigozie Obioma: By the Book - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Chigozie Obioma: By the Book Supported by By the Book Chigozie Obioma: By the Book Image Chigozie ObiomaCreditCreditIllustration by Jillian Tamaki Jan. 3, 2019 The author, most recently, of the novel “An Orchestra of Minorities” is “hardly turned off by considerations of genre. … I have found even manuals — of how to hunt wild birds in West Africa — fascinating.” What’s the last great book you read? “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.” It was suggested by a student of mine who wanted to reverse the student-professor relationship by stipulating that I read a particular book. Needless to say I obliged, and now thank her for it. Jean-Dominique Bauby’s extremely affecting memoir of being damaged by a stroke is as beautiful as it is disturbing. Yet what makes the craft worthwhile is how, through extremely mitigated prose and skillful curating, it manages never to become sentimental. It is an achievement. What classic novel did you recently read for the first time? I think it may now be called a classic, since he recently won the Nobel Prize: Kazuo Ishiguro’s “The Remains of the Day.” It is one of those books you can safely call “quiet” or “deceptive simplicity.” You begin reading Mr. Stevens’s eccentric account of the fall of the British tradition of the “great” butler only to find yourself slowly drawn into something larger, something achingly sinister. It is as if Ishiguro creates a controlled quicksand into which the reader slowly falls and falls until submerged. What do you read when you’re working on a book? And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing? It really depends. While working on “An Orchestra of Minorities,” I read a few books on Igbo cosmology simply to augment my knowledge of the cosmology and better recreate it in my fiction. But I sometimes find myself rereading works by great writers whose prose I envy. A slim census would include Vladimir Nabokov, Toni Morrison, Alan Paton, Arundhati Roy and Elizabeth Bowen, among others. What I don’t read while working on a book is any book that remotely resembles what I’m working on. I had to read George Saunders’s “Lincoln in the Bardo,” for instance, for a class I was teaching, and halfway through I wished I hadn’t included it in the list because the transient state of spirits and the liminality of some of the characters marginally resembles my new book. What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? There are many, but the one I remember quite often is that revenge is not justice. This wisdom is from “Cry, the Beloved Country,” by Alan Paton. It is basic human instinct to want to unsheathe the sword once things have swung in our favor, now that the world can hear us, see us and pay attention to us. It is instinctive that we mount the hill and attempt to stomp on those who have oppressed us. It is common for us to say: For so long you made us feel this way, now we must make you taste what it’s like. This is what Paton’s character Msimangu — foreseeing an eventual end to the heinous crime against humanity, apartheid — means when he says: “I have one great fear in my heart, that one day when they are turned to loving, they will find we are turned to hating.” What moves you most in a work of literature? Language. When a sentence jumps all of the rhetorical hurdles that life and our saturated minds place along the way to reach sublimity, I become moved to near tears. Consider this paragraph from Arundhati Roy’s novel “The God of Small Things”: “Being with Chacko made Margaret Kochamma feel as though her soul had escaped from the narrow confines of her island country into the vast, extravagant spaces of his. He made her feel as though the world belonged to them — as though it lay before them like an opened frog on a dissecting table, begging to be examined.” I call this audacious prose, and celebrate it enthusiastically. Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? My people say that a poor maid does not reject the embrace of a wealthy prince because of bad breath. I’m hardly turned off by considerations of genre or type. So I have found even manuals — of how to hunt wild birds in West Africa — fascinating. That said, if one returns to a well again and again and finds only bad-tasting water, it is difficult to keep returning there. This is why I tend to avoid works of fiction in which plot isn’t a function of character but the reverse, in which a set of events is orchestrated and characters are thrown in as fillers. I have this sense of the Dan Brown books especially. So I tend to avoid “upmarket crime thrillers.” Although, a few pages in, I’m liking “My Sister, the Serial Killer,” by Oyinkan Braithwaite. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night? All of the above. But I do prefer reading books during the day in paper form, and at night, for some reason, I have gotten hooked on my tablet. How do you organize your books? My work space is disorderly. I have books on the floor, even though my original intent was to designate one shelf for purchased books and a separate shelf for books sent to me by publishers to endorse. I find everything mixed up, with copies of The New York Times poking out between stacks of galleys and issues of The Virginia Quarterly Review. What’s the best book you’ve ever received as a gift? Khaled Hosseini’s “A Thousand Splendid Suns.” In 2008, I went from North Cyprus (where I was in college) to Mersin, Turkey, to spend the summer with a friend’s family, and they gave me a copy of the book. I found myself tearing into the riveting tale for the better part of the vacation. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? The books that stick with me include “The Palm-Wine Drinkard,” by Amos Tutuola; “Hamlet,” “Macbeth” and “Romeo and Juliet,” by William Shakespeare; “The Concubine,” by Elechi Amadi; “Ogboju Ode Ninu Igbo Irunmale,” by D. O. Fagunwa; and the beloved Nigerian children’s book “The Sugar Girl,” by Kola Onadipe, a novel about a poor girl who, through suffering and resilience, becomes very successful in society. It’s a book I wish had a more international appeal. [Read Chigozie Obioma’s essay about how he came to love reading.] What’s the last book you recommended to a member of your family? “Cry, the Beloved Country.” If you could require the American president to read one book, what would it be? And the president of Nigeria? I doubt if the United States president is a “yuuuge” fan of fiction, so I’ll not go there. Instead I’ll recommend Barack Obama’s “Dreams of My Father.” Should Trump choose to read it, not only would he develop a deeper appreciation of Obama, he would find himself reading great prose from a great writer (I often joke that Obama became president because Americans were smitten by his prose). With the Nigerian president, I expect there will be no luck with fiction either. So I’ll recommend Chinua Achebe’s “The Trouble With Nigeria.” First published as a kind of pamphlet, the book is easy to read, and should not be much of a challenge to Buhari, who — as I hear — has been struggling with the English language lately. You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? Writers one admires aren’t often the best to share tables with, I’d think! I wish I had met Nigeria’s Chinua Achebe, and still imagine the conversations we would have had. John Milton, the great mind and one of the greatest writers ever to live. I would want to sit by him at the table and inquire into how “Paradise Lost” was composed. Luckily, there is a writer alive whom I’d love to sit down with anytime! That would be Jennifer Clement, the author of the National Book Award-longlisted “Gun Love.” She is a remarkable writer and a great, warm person. Whom would you want to write your life story? Ha, interesting question. Perhaps my child? What do you plan to read next? “The Waves,” by Virginia Woolf. I have been meaning to finally read the one book of Woolf’s that I hear is just as great as the all-conquering “Mrs. Dalloway.” I have it on my desk right now. But I also want to finish “The Bible of Dirty Jokes,” by Eileen Pollack, who I think might be one of America’s most overlooked writers. And I hope to read the last part of “Duppy Conqueror: New and Selected Poems,” by Kwame Dawes. It is the last of his books in my collection of about five that I’ve yet to finish.

arts Brian Garfield, Prolific Author of ‘Death Wish,’ Dies at 79 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Obituaries Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Obituaries|Brian Garfield, Prolific Author of ‘Death Wish,’ Dies at 79 Supported by Brian Garfield, Prolific Author of ‘Death Wish,’ Dies at 79 Image Charles Bronson in the 1974 movie “Death Wish” based on the book of the same name by Brian Garfield. Four other “Death Wish” movies followed, as well as a 2018 version starring Bruce Willis.CreditCreditSilver Screen Collection/Getty Images By Katharine Q. Seelye Jan. 6, 2019 Brian Garfield, a prolific suspense author best known for his novel “Death Wish,” which became one of Hollywood’s longest-running film franchises, died on Dec. 29 at his home in Pasadena. He was 79. His wife, Bina Garfield, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease. A distant relation of Mark Twain’s, Mr. Garfield wrote more than 70 books, which have sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. Most were westerns, mystery novels and nonfiction. More than 19 movies were based on his writings. Image Mr. Garfield in an undated photo. His protagonist in “Death Sentence,” a follow-up to “Death Wish,” does not shoot to kill. “Any idiot can kill people,” the character says, “and you can’t teach someone a lesson by killing him.”CreditBina Garfield By far the best known was “Death Wish” (1972), a novel about a classic bleeding-heart liberal New Yorker whose wife and daughter are attacked by muggers; his wife is killed and his daughter is left in a vegetative state. He then becomes a vigilante hellbent on vengeance. Mr. Garfield said his aim was to show “an ordinary guy who descends into madness.” A feature film based on the novel and starring Charles Bronson was made in 1974; it spawned a series of four other “Death Wish” films, all starring Mr. Bronson but not called sequels for copyright reasons. A remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis, was released in 2018. The first film was a hit at the box office but divided the critics, some of whom found the premise repulsive and irresponsible. Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, said: “For short‐term fun, it exploits very real fears and social problems and suggests simple‐minded remedies by waving the American flag much in the fashion that former Vice President Agnew used to do.” Mr. Garfield, who himself was unhappy with the film portrayals, wrote a follow-up novel to “Death Wish” called “Death Sentence” (1975), which he called his “penance” for the violence in “Death Wish.” His “Death Sentence” protagonist, who does not shoot to kill, notes: “Any idiot can kill people — and you can’t teach someone a lesson by killing him.” Mr. Garfield was rarely involved in the film adaptations of his books, deliberately extricating himself from a process he found distasteful even though it meant giving up control. (His 1975 novel “Hopscotch,” which won an Edgar Award, was an exception: He adapted it into a comedy starring Walter Matthau in 1980.) Image Mr. Garfield’s “Death Wish” was the best known of his more than 70 books. “I’m not really patient enough to put up with that, and I learned that the credit ‘associate producer’ means you’re the only person who’s willing to associate with the producer,” he said in an interview with the website PopMatters in 2008. “I prefer writing books, because a book belongs to its writer,” he added. “And nobody has the power to tell me how to fix it.” Brian Francis Wynne Garfield was born on Jan. 26, 1939, in Manhattan. His mother, Frances (O’Brien) Garfield, an artist, was a protégé of Georgia O’Keeffe, and it was O’Keeffe who introduced Ms. O’Brien to her future husband, George Garfield, an entrepreneur. His mother painted covers for The Saturday Review of Books and frequently had writers and artists around the house, so her son grew up comfortable in that milieu. He wrote his first book, “Range Justice,” a western, when he was 18. Brian had asthma, and the family moved to Arizona to ease the condition. He graduated from Southern Arizona School for Boys in Tucson before receiving his bachelor’s and master’s degrees, both in English, from the University of Arizona. Mr. Garfield played the guitar and in the late 1950s toured the country with a band called “The Palisades,” which had a doo-wop hit called “I Can’t Quit.” He also served in the Army and the Army Reserves from 1957 to 1965. He was married and divorced twice. He is survived by his third wife, Bina, whom he married in 1985. Mr. Garfield enjoyed almost all forms of writing, ranging from “The Thousand-Mile War: World War II in Alaska and the Aleutians” (1969), a nonfiction account of Alaska’s so-called “forgotten war,” to a musical comedy TV movie, “Legs” (1983), about the Rockettes. He did not favor one genre over any other. In testament to his versatility, his literary agent, Judy Coppage, said in a telephone interview, Mr. Garfield was the only person to have served as president of both the Western Writers of America and the Mystery Writers of America. Mr. Garfield was also a speedy writer. He said he dashed off “Death Wish” in two weeks, prompting his friends to ask, “What took you so long?” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: Brian Garfield, 79, Writer of Suspense Whose Tales Found a Home at the Movies.

arts The Choreographed Cacophony of ‘Ferryman’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Subscribe Log In Arts|The Choreographed Cacophony of ‘Ferryman’ Image "The Ferryman" employs both a live goose and rabbit for the show, keeping the animal handler Rochelle Scudder, left, very busy.CreditCreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times The Choreographed Cacophony of ‘Ferryman’ With a cast of 21, plus a live goose and rabbit, the dizzying number of comings and goings in this Broadway show requires an incredible attention to detail. "The Ferryman" employs both a live goose and rabbit for the show, keeping the animal handler Rochelle Scudder, left, very busy.CreditCreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Supported by By Sarah Lyall Jan. 4, 2019 Onstage the other night at “The Ferryman,” Jez Butterworth’s wrenching play about an extended family in 1980s Northern Ireland, nearly two dozen people were embarking on another evening of love, lust, dancing, drinking, politics and violence. But upstairs in a makeshift kitchen carved from a dressing room, Clem Zajac, head of props, was speed-sliding his potatoes into the oven, peeling his carrots and constructing his roast goose (in actual fact, pieces of roast beef layered over a goose-like base). He didn’t have much time. These and other non-fake foods would soon feature in the pivotal Act II feast scene, where the characters would eat them. All Broadway plays are complicated in their own ways. But “The Ferryman,” which opened at the Bernard M. Jacobs Theater in October after a London run, has presented extra logistical challenges for the multitudes working on the production. It’s not just that the play has a cast of 21 people (aside from understudies), including four young children and a real live infant. Nor is it just that the characters enter and exit from four separate locations — one of them via a steep staircase perpetually populated by someone who is lingering on or running up or down it — in a dizzyingly choreographed dance of comings and goings. Image The cast of 21 enters and exits the stage from four separate locations, including via a steep staircase.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times It’s also everything else: the live goose and the live rabbit that come out at two crucial moments; the freshly sautéed bacon and the authentic goose fat that is being used to roast the potatoes at the insistence of the director, Sam Mendes; the table lamp whose shade erupts into flames; the smells of peat that waft through the theater, evoking the rural countryside; and three different consistencies of stage blood used at three different bloody moments for three different purposes — dripping, oozing and splattering. Before any of that, it’s a matter of pure logistics, getting all the actors and all the crew members and all the props in the right place at the right time. Image CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times “I’ve been acting for nearly 40 years, but basically this is the biggest play I’ve ever been in, in terms of cast,” said Mark Lambert, who plays Uncle Pat. “It’s like a relay race where everyone is passing the baton, and you’re always coming offstage when someone else is coming on.” The backstage area can grow crowded and busy, like a school hallway between classes. It falls to the production stage manager, Jill Cordle, to bring order to what could easily descend into chaos. Image As stage manager, Jill Cordle, left, keeps all the action on track.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times “It’s a lot to keep track of, with children and animals and older actors and babies, but the story itself is straightforward, and everything makes sense,” she said. Backstage, too, the actors were collecting and discarding props, making quick costume changes, at least one per person — and submitting to on-the-spot modifications. At one point, Justin Edwards, playing a slow-minded Englishman called Tom Kettle, was sprayed with water and strategically daubed with (organic) mud, so it looked as if he had just come from the marshes. Image Niall Wright, who plays one of the teenaged sons of Paddy Considine’s Quinn Carney, wetting his hair backstage before a scene.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Image Verisimilitude, like making sure a pair of boots has the proper amount of muck, is key to the production.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times His co-star in the next scene, a live Emden goose named Peggy whom he tucked, football-style, under his arm as he came onstage, had likewise been strategically muddied. (While Mr. Edwards’s clothes would have to be cleaned later on, Peggy always cleans herself.) Raised from an egg by the veteran animal trainer William Berloni and by the animal handler assigned to the production, Rochelle Scudder, Peggy — who successfully laid an egg offstage during a recent performance — has proved herself to be a calm and affectionate goose who can handle the spotlight. She spends her downtime in Ms. Scudder’s little animal sanctuary area down in the basement and is handed directly to Mr. Edwards before her scene each night. Image In addition to the goose, Justin Edwards, who plays a slow-minded Englishman called Tom Kettle, also gets to cradle a rabbit.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Image Pierce, a Netherland dwarf rabbit, got the job because of his gentle disposition and love of cozy, enclosed spaces.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times The other animal in the production, a Netherland dwarf rabbit animal named Pierce because his early dark fur was reminiscent of Pierce Brosnan’s hair, also waits in the basement, where he has a hutch. He got the job — which mostly requires nestling inside Tom Kettle’s coat pocket — because of his gentle disposition and love of cozy, enclosed spaces; a competing rabbit grew too big and too bouncy and lost the part. Animals are one thing; children are another. Corralling and keeping track of seven of them — four in the main cast, and three understudies, aged from 10 to 13 — falls to the production’s two child guardians. Image In the cramped backstage of the theater, the actors often hang out in the green room before and during the performance.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Before the performances, the children hang out in their dressing rooms, which take up two floors in the narrow backstage tower, whiling away the time playing cards, Jenga and Clue and making up dances, said Krystal Rowley, the head child guardian. Their needs are unpredictable: The other night, for instance, one of the girls bit into a Tootsie Roll and unexpectedly lost a tooth with less than an hour to go. (She was fine; the show went on.) The play also features an infant, which means that two working baby actors, accompanied by a parent, are on hand, too. Image There is always a second baby on hand, in case of a sudden mood- or diaper-related mishap.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Because of their natural unpredictability, both babies — the main one and the auxiliary baby — wait backstage until the last minute. If a sudden mood or diaper mishap strikes, the other goes on. “A live baby is like having a ticking bomb on the stage,” Tim Hoare, an associate director, said. “One of the first things a producer would usually say is, ‘Can we have a lifelike doll, or find some other way around it?’” But the live baby added to the verisimilitude of the production, he said. Just as the Mr. Mendes and the playwright, Mr. Butterworth, did not want a fake baby, they did not want fake anything else. So when a lampshade catches fire in an early scene, the flames are real. Image A prop master makes sure the candles are ready to go before the play begins.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Image Tom Ferguson, the production’s pyrotechnician, ensures that a lampshade catches fires at each performance during an early scene.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times As always, the conflagration the other night was set off by the production’s pyrotechnician, Tom Ferguson, who ignited it via a backstage mechanism that sent heat to a lighter-fluid-doused match head secreted within the lamp. The heat lit the match, and the lampshade burned up, only to be replaced anew for the next performance. In addition to the props, Mr. Zajac is in charge of the food, and much of his work requires split-second backstage precision. Image Clem Zajac, head of props, is also in charge of the food, including a roast goose.CreditSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times Moments before the roast goose was removed from the oven onstage in Act II, for instance, Mr. Zajac poured boiling water on special absorbent material secreted at the bottom of the pan — this ensures that the bird appears to be steaming hot — and then discreetly slid the pan into the stage oven through an opening backstage. Then there is the pistol that goes off in the play’s final scene, sending blood spewing — courtesy of a concealed blood cannon — across a wall covered with children’s artwork. “The blood can go six to 10 feet, and sometimes even higher,” Mr. Zajac said proudly. “Every night, we come out and mop out and clean up the walls.” There is an inviolate ritual attached to the pistol. The actor about to get shot was taken backstage before the scene, as he is every time, and shown the gun and the ammunition — a handful of blanks. He was also shown that the gun had been altered so it could not use real bullets — information that enabled him to go on without fearing that he might be the unwitting victim of a sudden Agatha Christie-style theatrical murder. There was a second gun backstage, ready to be fired if for some reason the gun onstage failed to go off (so far, that hasn’t happened). And after the climactic scene and then the curtain, Mr. Zajac was, as always, waiting in the wings, stage left. “After the first bow, I receive the gun from Paddy,” he said, referring to Paddy Considine, the actor who plays the key role of Quinn Carney. “And then I unload it, put it in its case, and put it back into the gun safe.” And then cleanup begins.

arts The Best Art of 2018 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|The Best Art of 2018 Supported by The Best Art of 2018 Image Some highlights of the year included, from top left, Hilma af Klint, Bruce Nauman, Huma Bhabha, Antonio Canova, Charles White and Eugène Delacroix.CreditCreditClockwise from top left, The Hilma af Klint Foundation, Stockholm; Bruce Nauman/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Vincent Tullo for The New York Times; George Etheredge for The New York Times; Emon Hassan for The New York Times; The Charles White Archives/The Art Institute of Chicago; Agaton Strom for The New York Times By Roberta Smith, Holland Cotter and Jason Farago Dec. 5, 2018 The art critics of The New York Times tell you what rocked their worlds this year: notable art events, works in museums and galleries, emerging artists and how they found beauty in unexpected places. Roberta Smith’s List | Holland Cotter’s List | Jason Farago’s Global Highlights Roberta Smith Winners and Losers Image A series of Altarpieces in “Hilma af Klint: Paintings for the Future” at the Guggenheim use ascending and descending triangles set against energized orbs. Mysticism informed her pioneering abstraction.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times When the going gets rough, there’s always art. It can soothe and teach you, and arm you with new tools and perspectives with which to face the world. This year had some great winners and obvious losers. Winner: Art History, Refigured One of the most thrilling winners was European and American art history. Magnificent exhibitions at three museums advanced new research in areas that had seemed thoroughly explored. The Guggenheim Museum offers a revisionary chapter about the start of modern abstraction in its current headliner, “Hilma af Klint: Paintings for the Future,” introducing works that this Swedish artist and mystic made in 1906-7. Suddenly, the most sacred genesis tale of Modernism — the invention of abstract painting — has acquired a female actor who actually got there several years ahead of the revered triumvirate of Kandinsky, Mondrian and Malevich. Af Klint’s joyous paintings, with their radical palette, scale and openness, push abstraction toward the future. (Through April 23.) Another gauntlet landed with “Posing Modernity: The Black Model From Manet and Matisse to Today,” at the Wallach Art Gallery of Columbia University. Partnering with the Musée d’Orsay, the Wallach has combined some great paintings (by Manet, Bazille, Degas, Matisse and Bearden) with fascinating ephemera, bringing new detail about the plight and presence of black women in late-19th-century Paris life and art, and following this theme through the Harlem Renaissance into the present. (Through Feb. 10.) In Washington, the Smithsonian American Art Museum unveiled “Between Worlds: The Art of Bill Traylor,” a stunning retrospective of this once-unknown outsider genius (1853-1949), a former slave and tenant farmer who spent the last decade of his precarious life making drawings on the streets of Montgomery, Ala. Effortless in their fusion of narrative and form, Traylor’s images distill memories harsh and pleasant into taut silhouettes on found cardboard. They now count among the greatest works of 20th-century American art, and thanks to a magnificent catalog, the artist is obscure no more. The show will not travel, so plan a trip to Washington soon. (Through March 17.) Loser: The Metropolitan Museum of Art Blinks, Twice Everyone who likes art, except residents of New York State, lost when the Met persuaded New York City officials to replace “pay what you wish” with an egregious mandatory fee of $25. With this, the immensely wealthy Met sacrificed one of its most honorable features: the broad accessibility offered by libraries. The loser is visual literacy. In the fall, financial anxiety led the Met to back out of the last three years of its eight-year lease of the Met Breuer and reabsorb its department of Modern and contemporary art into its main building. The program at the Met Breuer has been surprisingly good and getting better, but attendance hasn’t been high enough. It certainly didn’t help that the Fifth Avenue museum remained the staging ground of big-draw contemporary shows like the David Hockney retrospective or the recent display of gifts from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation. Winner: Van Gogh Again Image Willem Dafoe as Vincent van Gogh in “At Eternity's Gate,” a film directed by Julian Schnabel.CreditLily Gavin/CBS Films The year brought an outstanding movie about a painter: Julian Schnabel’s “At Eternity’s Gate,” an intimate, atmospheric treatment of the last days of Vincent van Gogh. Such endeavors rarely attain credibility, and yet this century now boasts two, the other being Mike Leigh’s lavish “Mr. Turner” (2014). “At Eternity’s Gate” is carried by its star, Willem Dafoe, whose gripping performance is aided by his uncanny resemblance to the artist. Mr. Schnabel’s stated goal was to desensationalize the story of van Gogh — usually depicted as a mad artist who killed himself and died in obscurity. The movie makes a good case against each of those points, starting with its plain, unsensational style. What we get is an impassioned, articulate artist who adored nature and painting it and had a touchingly codependent relationship with his younger brother Theo. Mr. Schnabel also sides with those who argue that van Gogh did not commit suicide and proposes that he was killed by two youths playing with a gun. Winner: A Genre Revitalized Former President Barack Obama and the former first lady Michelle Obama elevated a dreary academic ritual — the official White House portrait — making a routine post-presidential event an instance of change. Seeing advantage in the renewed liveliness of figure painting, the couple chose a well-known painter, Kehinde Wiley (for Mr. Obama’s portrait), and a lesser-known artist, Amy Sherald (for Mrs. Obama’s). The depictions at the National Portrait Gallery are more than good enough — and the better for being such distinctive, explicitly human departures from a fossilized tradition that, with luck, will never be the same. Winners: The Citizens of Chicago Image Kerry James Marshall’s beloved mural about the power of books, “Knowledge and Wonder,” will remain at the Chicago Public Library’s Legler branch.CreditCity of Chicago A much-loved public mural by the painter Kerry James Marshall is staying put. Called “Knowledge and Wonder,” it was commissioned in 1995 for the Chicago Public Library’s Legler branch, on the city’s West Side, and celebrates the library as a source of mystery and wonder for children. With Mr. Marshall’s profile and his prices on the rise, the city decided to sell it at Christie’s, hoping to raise $10 million to fund an expanded library and a new public-art program. But with rising prices come increased clout, and when Mr. Marshall objected to the sale of his 10-by-23-foot work, the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, reversed course. Loser: An Auction Low The British street artist Banksy put up a work at Sotheby’s auction house that half-destructed as the gavel came down, thanks to a remote-control shredder built into its frame. (It sold for $1.4 million.) The audience seemed genuinely shocked; those behind the podium, not so much. Banksy’s clever trick is sure to earn him a footnote in auction history, which is no stranger to stunts (most involving chandelier pricing). Still, this one did give rise to a slender hope that if such tricks become an auction house staple, serious people might go back to buying art the old-fashioned way — from galleries. But not yet. Everyone was back at the madness the following week, bidding up a Hockney and a Hopper to record prices. Holland Cotter Best in Show Image Installation views of “Afro-Atlantic Histories” at the São Paulo Museum of Art.CreditEduardo Ortega In 2018, a politically shuddersome year, the international art world was both out to lunch and on the alert. Art fairs and auctions continued to serve as conveyor belts for investment capital. Cheerleading and celebrity chat passed for discourse. At the same time, a spirit of resistance was building, and some critical projects came to pass. 1. ‘Histórias Afro-Atlânticas’ (‘Afro-Atlantic Histories’) This immense exhibition, split between two Brazilian institutions, the São Paulo Museum of Art (known as MASP) and the Tomie Ohtake Foundation in the same city, was an eye-filling, mind-altering account of how a profound evil — slavery — revolutionized a hemisphere. The show closed just a week before Brazil elected Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, in the country’s most radical shift since the military dictatorship of decades ago. A second Ohtake Foundation show, organized by the young curator Paulo Miyada, documented that murderous earlier era and, in the charged postelection climate, felt like an act of courage. 2. ‘National Memorial for Peace and Justice’ Conceived by the Equal Justice Initiative and set on a hill overlooking Montgomery, Ala., this memorial to racial violence is a giant Minimalist sculpture with maximalist emotional content: The hundreds of steel plates that make up its structure are inscribed with the names of many of the 4,000 African-Americans lynched between 1877 and 1950. A second site downtown, the Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration, brings the story of white supremacy into the present. Together, they pack a wallop. You come away changed. 3. ‘Adrian Piper: A Synthesis of Intuitions, 1965-2016’ This exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art was one of the most un-MoMA shows I’ve ever seen there. A 50-year survey of an American artist who has taken racism, misogyny and xenophobia as her themes, while refusing to be defined by them, it made the museum feel like a life-engaged place, not the high-polish, content-muting one we’ve grown used to. 4. ‘Charles White: A Retrospective’ Image An oil-wash drawing by Charles White of a street preacher, titled “Black Pope (Sandwich Board Man),” at the Museum of Modern Art. He flashes viewers a papal blessing and a peace sign. CreditAgaton Strom for The New York Times MoMA came through again with this survey of a painter and draftsman who made African America his theme, and formal beauty his means. White (1918-79) had the hand of an angel and the mind of a sage. Both warm this show, on view through Jan. 13. And both were evident in two other high points of the season: an exhibition of work, at the New Museum, by the contemporary Ghanaian-born British filmmaker John Akomfrah, and a career overview, at MoMA PS1, of the Iranian-born playwright, director and performer Reza Abdoh, who rocketed across the international theater before succumbing to AIDS in 1995, at 32. 5. ‘Zoe Leonard: Survey’ This show last spring at the Whitney Museum of American Art was a lesson in the power of visual understatement. I had wondered ahead of time if Ms. Leonard’s austere, allusive, intensely personal work would be able to cast its spell in the Whitney’s wide-open reaches. It did. (The show is now at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, through March 25.) A bit later in the year, the museum took another formal risk — and had another win — with “Pacha, Llaqta, Wasichay: Indigenous Space, Modern Architecture, New Art,” a show that mixed craft, architecture and performance in the work of seven young Latinx (a gender-neutral term for Latino) artists, and introduced a fine new Whitney curator, the Puerto Rican-born Marcela Guerrero. 6. ‘Striking Iron: The Art of African Blacksmiths’ This exhibition at the Fowler Museum of Art and Culture, University of California, Los Angeles, is the most beautiful sculpture show of the year. It touches on the myriad traditional uses of iron in Africa, and even the ordinary objects look magical: a sickle in the shape of a beast with a bristling mane; a hoe distilling the essence of elephant, all trunk and ears; an herbalist’s staff that trails a flock of tiny, tissue-thin iron birds. (Through Dec. 30.) 7. ‘In the Fields of Empty Days: The Intersection of Past and Present in Iranian Art’ This show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art was yet another rewarding gamble. Combining historical material with contemporary Iranian art, the exhibition was, in effect, a critical history of heroes — emperor, athlete, saint — though it never explained that theme. Indeed, it said little about its intentions or its works; the galleries were all but bare of labels. Ordinarily, I would find their absence annoying, but here, because the art was so strong, I was caught up in its drama. The show is still vivid in my mind months later. 8. ‘Fra Angelico: Heaven on Earth’ Image Fra Angelico, “The Dormition and Assumption of the Virgin,” 1424-1434, tempera with oil glazes and gold on panel.CreditIsabella Stewart Gardner Museum The dreamiest Italian Renaissance painting in America, Fra Angelico’s “The Dormition and Assumption of the Virgin,” is tucked away in a corner of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and easy to miss. But, for this show, it was put in the spotlight and surrounded by a dozen other pictures by the artist. The intention was to illuminate an overlooked aspect of his work: his skill as a reality-grounded storyteller. But what also came through in our distracted age was the radical nature of his spiritual composure. 9. A Daring New Wing The Metropolitan Museum of Art recently announced a renovation of its existing galleries of art from Africa, Oceania and the Americas. The renovation would present an opportunity to remap global history accurately by making transcultural connections among objects old and new, Western and non-Western. If the Met pursues this route with daring and commitment, it will do what no other encyclopedic museum in this country has done. 10. Toward A New Ethics Last year, President Emmanuel Macron of France announced his intention to return African art objects in his nation’s museums to their countries of origin, temporarily or permanently. He commissioned the Savoy-Sarr report to determine the mechanics of restitution. Soon after its release, he announced that an initial group of 26 objects at the Quai Branly Museum would return to Benin (suggesting that others be made available to their home nations not only through restitutions but also through exhibitions, exchanges and loans). The implications for museums, collectors and markets, in and beyond the field of African art, are huge. Fireworks lie ahead. But, bottom line, restitution is right. It’s the hows and the whens that are up for debate. Jason Farago Global Highlights Image A view of the Fondazione Prada show “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum. Art Life Politics: Italia 1918-1943.”CreditFondazione Prada After the wailing comes the work. If 2017 was art’s year of indignation, in 2018 artists and museums have hunkered down and gotten serious about the immense political, environmental and technological hazards that lie before us. I’ve spent much of the year in Europe, and there and here I’ve seen a new commitment to building a common future. 1. Fondazione Prada This was the year the Italian nonprofit, created in 1993 by Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, arrived as one of the world’s pre-eminent institutions of modern art. At its Milan headquarters, it mounted the most important show of 2018: “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum. Art Life Politics: Italia 1918–1943,” a meticulous mapping of how fascism moves from the margins to the center of society, via 600 works of interwar Italian art by Morandi, De Chirico, Severini and far less familiar names. Its current Baroque exhibition, curated by Luc Tuymans, puts Caravaggio alongside contemporary art, and a new slanting tower, by Rem Koolhaas, delivers acres of gallery space and the disco of my dreams. It turns out that money is not what the art world should fear most; what we should fear is inertia, and we should combat it with the tools Ms. Prada herself wields: discipline, rigor, gravity, style. 2. ‘Delacroix’ In a tumultuous year for the Metropolitan Museum of Art — which got a bright new director, Max Hollein; cut loose the Breuer, its underachieving satellite; and dishonored itself with new mandatory admission — this shadowy show of France’s champion Romantic made it all O.K. (His first comprehensive retrospective in North America!) I might have preferred the Delacroix feast at the Musée du Louvre, its first stop; the Met has had to make do without most of his large works. But at both museums, Delacroix’s agitated scenes of passion and empire speak emphatically to contemporary appetites and anxieties. (Through Jan. 6.) 3. Cao Fei In this Chinese artist’s video installation “Asia One,” a wrenching tragedy of love and economics at the Guggenheim last summer, we meet the two last humans in an automated factory — ostensibly from the “future,” but filmed at a real Shanghai factory where workers are already unnecessary. Their every move is recorded, logged and scored; they ache to connect, but find human emotions beyond them. Recently, the Beijing municipal government announced that all the capital’s citizens will be tracked and assigned permanent ratings that could improve or impede their daily lives. Soon, we will all work in Asia One. 4. ‘Bruce Nauman: Disappearing Acts’ This two-part, all-media retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (through Feb. 18) and MoMA PS1 (through Feb. 25) offers a master class in the limits of the body, the limits of language and the artistic desire to push beyond them. It is also the finest of swan songs for its curator, Kathy Halbreich, MoMA’s former associate director, who did so much to revive the museum’s engagement with the art of today. 5. ‘Canova’s George Washington’ The Frick Collection finally got its long-wished-for approval for an expansion to the east, but this was the more immediate coup: a loan of Canova’s full-scale model for a lost marble statue of the first American president, wearing a Roman skirt and writing his farewell address in Italian. Imposing, adamant, the image of restraint, this plaster Washington came across as an act of subtle opposition by New York’s most old-school of museums. 6. Germany Goes Global Image A museum show for the age of migration: European porcelain figure of an “oriental woman” from around 1860, right, is among the transcultural objects on display in “Mobile Worlds” at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg, Germany.CreditGeneviève Frisson/Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Even before the momentous Savoy-Sarr report raised the temperature in European museums with colonial holdings, an ambitious show in Hamburg boldly imagined a new, more just collection. It was “Mobile Worlds,” Roger M. Buergel’s delirious rethinking of applied arts, which mined the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe for Afro-Brazilian fabrics, Chinese porcelain with Arabic inscriptions, and other transcultural objects that evade the logic of imperial classification. 7. David Levine’s ‘Some of the People, All of the Time’ This summer, the Brooklyn Museum hosted one of the first great works of art of the Trump era, a requiem for democratic authenticity in an age of lies. Mr. Levine’s hourlong monologue, performed by professional actors in the galleries over six weeks, recounts the psychological toll of being a “fake person,” whether you’re writing a sock-puppet social media account or cheering a candidacy at Trump Tower. I sorely regret not reviewing it; buy the current issue of n+1 magazine, which has published the script. 8. The Chosen People Two excellent shows timed to the Soviet Union’s centenary have explored the dreams and nightmares of Jewish artists of the left, and what became of their utopianism after 1918. “Comrade. Jew. We Only Wanted Paradise on Earth,” at the Jewish Museum in Vienna, offered a hundred-year survey of the art and literature of Jewish Communists, from Moscow to the gulag and into exile. And “Chagall, Lissitzky, Malevich,” seen at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and currently at the Jewish Museum in New York (through Jan. 6), vibrantly restages debates about a new Communist art at one revolutionary academy in Vitebsk. 9. Ladies of the Laboratory The American Folk Art Museum showed Orra White Hitchcock, a Massachusetts matron whose beguiling illustrations of mushrooms and mammoths were tied up with love for her husband, for God and for all earthly creation. And, through Feb. 17, the New York Public Library has a small firecracker in the form of Anna Atkins, the seaweed-loving Victorian who sewed cyanotypes of British algae into the world’s first photo books. 10. Kylian Mbappé This prodigy footballer is only 19 and already the most polished French artist since Matisse. For what is art if not the junction of form and meaning? And what does Mbappé deliver, while blatherers scorn the new, plural Europe he incarnates, but renewed faith in the political power of beauty? When I watched Mbappé, so confident in blue, as he dashed and nutmegged to this year’s World Cup trophy, I felt what I too rarely feel: unalloyed hope for the generation to come.

Last week 21 Savage briefly flashed through the social media outrage cycle when LeBron James quoted a lyric from one of the songs on “I Am > I Was,” writing on Instagram: “We been getting that Jewish money/Everything is Kosher.” (This was a day after James said N.F.L. team owners have a “slave mentality.”) Both men subsequently made statements, with 21 Savage tweeting, “I’m sorry if I offended everybody never my intention I love all people.” The Jewish people I know are very wise with there money so that’s why I said we been gettin Jewish money I never thought anyone would take offense I’m sorry if I offended everybody never my intention I love all people— Saint Laurent Don (@21savage) December 25, 2018 Also on this week’s album chart, the rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie opened at No. 2 with “Hoodie SZN” (Highbridge/Atlantic), while streaming pushed several holiday albums high. Michael Bublé’s “Christmas,” a seasonal hit eight years running now, climbed one spot to No. 3. Cole’s album “The Christmas Song,” originally released in 1963 — featuring his hit by the same name, better known by its opening line, “Chestnuts roasting on an open fire” — landed at No. 7 this week, putting Cole in the Top 10 of Billboard’s album chart for the first time since 1965. (His holiday album had previously peaked at No. 15.) Carey’s “Merry Christmas,” which includes her hit “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” landed at No. 8 — thanks in part to huge streaming numbers on Christmas Eve. It was the first time that album reached the Top 10 since 1995. Kodak Black’s album “Dying to Live,” last week’s No. 1, fell to No. 9 in its second week out.

arts In Stories From an Argentine Surrealist, Circles of Madness and Violence - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|In Stories From an Argentine Surrealist, Circles of Madness and Violence Supported by Books of The Times In Stories From an Argentine Surrealist, Circles of Madness and Violence By Parul Sehgal Jan. 1, 2019 Image CreditCreditSonny Figueroa/The New York Times In the 1940s, the great pediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott became a regular at a small London bookshop. Biographies were his chief interest. It didn’t matter whose; he read them all — books about soldiers, scientists, actors. Amazed, the bookseller once asked him how he kept up such a pace. “Oh, I’m only interested up to the age of 5,” Winnicott reportedly replied. Childhood, and its contusions, are also the governing preoccupations of the Argentine writer Samanta Schweblin. Her stories are obsessed with notions of purity and danger; with the ways people can be deformed, very early on, in the name of tenderness, teaching and care. All this without a whisper of sentimentality. Schweblin is among the most acclaimed Spanish-language writers of her generation. She has said her love of literature came from American writers like John Cheever and Raymond Carver. (You might also detect the influence of her contemporaries Kelly Link and Jesse Ball.) But, to me, her true ancestor could only be David Lynch; her tales are woven out of dread, doubles and confident loose ends. “Mouthful of Birds,” a collection of 20 stories, has just been published in English. It follows the success of “Fever Dream” (2017) (both seamlessly translated by Megan McDowell), a dialogue between a poisoned woman and a young boy who has information about what is killing her. It’s a mournful, terrifying book — classic horror meets eco-thriller, a story about the ferocity of maternal love and its inadequacies in the face of a world we have destroyed. The original title of the novel was “Distancia de Rescate” — “Rescue Distance” — after the dying woman’s term for how far she would allow her child to roam. The new collection is impressive, but it lacks the finish of “Fever Dream.” It contains three perfect stories (“Headlights,” “Mouthful of Birds,” “Toward Happy Civilization”), three stinkers and a handful of exploratory sketches. There’s a feeling of peeking into Schweblin’s notebook, of watching her early experiments with technique (this book was originally published before the novel). She can be oblique, as in “Slowing Down,” a story about aging (I think?), then blunt, as in “Heads Against Concrete,” with its opening line: “If you pound a person’s head against concrete — even if you’re doing it only so they’ll come to their senses — you will very likely end up hurting them.” Image Samanta SchweblinCreditAlejandra Lopez These stories spiral into their own circles of madness, but they all belong to the same universe. Odd plot points repeat: mysterious holes in the ground, violence to animals, violence to children, violence to children disguised as animals. They begin in barren landscapes, on empty plains and steppes, on interrupted journeys. There are grotesque parodies of family life (a pair of kidnappers treat their prisoners with the loving pride of parents), parodies of work (a woman’s job requires her to lie facedown on a table and have her leg hair ritually plucked away by six beauticians). The desperate desire to bear children recurs but so too does ambivalence, even revulsion. One woman decides she does not want to be pregnant and wills her belly to shrink and shrink until she finally spits out the baby — “the size of an almond” — into a jar, to wait for the future. Maybe. The clearest line of continuity is in the dialogue, in how the characters communicate — or don’t, rather. There are strains of Beckett and Pinter in the way Schweblin’s people use so many words to say so little. They have a fondness for digging holes in the ground, to hide in, and they use language to the same effect. This is to say nothing of the perverse ways people speak to themselves. In the title story, a man discovers that his teenage daughter has taken to eating live pet birds. He is repulsed when he catches her at it for the first time, when he hears the bird scream and sees her bloodstained mouth smiling in shy apology. But he quickly begins explaining it away to himself: “I thought about how, considering there are people who eat people, eating live birds wasn’t so bad. Also, from a natural point of view it was healthier than drugs, and from a social one, it was easier to hide than a pregnancy at 13.” Schweblin’s characters constantly talk themselves out of their perceptions, out of reality. Schweblin herself stopped talking when she was 12 years old. She has said she was overwhelmed by the gulf between what she wanted to say and what she thought people could understand. The school principal required a doctor’s note testifying that she was normal in order for her to continue with classes. A psychotherapist complied, stating that she was extremely normal but had a “complete disinterest” in the world around her. That diagnosis of aristocratic disdain must have been a gift to a precocious 12-year-old. What makes Schweblin so startling as a writer, however, what makes her rare and important, is that she is impelled not by mere talent or ambition but by vision, and that vision emerges from intense concern with the world, with the hidden cruelties in our relationships with all that is vulnerable — children, rivers, language, one another. Look again at any of her stories — about these bizarre rituals and stupid jobs, the baroque torture of animals, the asphyxiation of children — strip away all that seems fantastic, keep only that mirror-smooth prose, and what do you see? Schweblin’s dark farces just might awaken you to some of your own. Follow Parul Sehgal on Twitter: @parul_sehgal.

arts Edgar Hilsenrath, 92, Writer of Unvarnished Holocaust Novels, Dies - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Obituaries Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Obituaries|Edgar Hilsenrath, 92, Writer of Unvarnished Holocaust Novels, Dies Supported by Edgar Hilsenrath, 92, Writer of Unvarnished Holocaust Novels, Dies Image Edgar Hilsenrath in Hamburg, Germany, in 2006. “To write grotesque things is my way of laughing at death,” he said.CreditCreditMaurizio Gambarini/DPA, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Sam Roberts Jan. 3, 2019 Edgar Hilsenrath, a German Jewish survivor of Nazi persecution who unsentimentally stoked the embers of the Holocaust with brutally satirical autobiographical novels, died on Sunday in Wittlich, Germany. He was 92. His death was announced by his French publisher, Le Tripode. Mr. Hilsenrath finished his first novel, “Night,” after emigrating to New York in 1951 as a refugee from war-torn Europe. (He lived in New York until 1975.) Published in English in 1964, the novel was inspired by his dehumanizing captivity in a Jewish ghetto. He also wrote a celebrated farce, “The Nazi and the Barber” (1971), which tells the story of an SS officer and mass murderer who kills his Jewish best friend from childhood, assumes his identity, flees to Palestine and is transformed into an ardent Zionist. “To write grotesque things is my way of laughing at death,” Mr. Hilsenrath told the French newspaper Le Figaro in 2012. Having witnessed and withstood many of the horrors of the Holocaust and its aftermath, Mr. Hilsenrath un-self-consciously challenged more conventional and deferential post-World War II accounts about the victims of Nazi atrocities. He said his goal was to balance the “great and weighty voices” of historians with the “little chattering voices” of ordinary Jews. “In Germany people want to make up to the Jews for what happened by idealizing them,” he told the German newsweekly Der Spiegel in 2005. “The Jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else.” If readers criticized him for portraying some Jews in “Night” as “suspicious, miserable and mean,” he said, “it is not the Jews that I was describing, but rather the poverty of the ghetto.” Image “The Nazi and The Barber” by Edgar Hilsenrath. As a result, his early manuscripts were initially rejected by scores of German publishing houses and generated mixed reviews. But in 1977, when “The Nazi and the Barber” was finally published in Germany, the Nobel laureate in literature Heinrich Boll, writing in Die Zeit, another German weekly, praised the novel’s “gloomy and quiet poetry.” In 2016, the critic Helmut Bottiger wrote in Süddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich newspaper, that this novel was “undoubtedly one of the most important in the history of the Federal Republic.” Among Mr. Hilsenrath’s other books were “The Tale of the Last Thought” (1989), about the Armenian genocide by Turks; “The Adventures of Ruben Jablonski” (1997); and “Berlin … Endstation” (2006). Mr. Hilsenrath began his novel “Jossel Wassermann’s Return” (1993) with the wind whispering to a rabbi as it rushes past the window of a train deporting Jews from an Eastern European shtetl. “Yes, you are perfectly right,” the rabbi says, nodding to the wind in agreement. He adds: “The goyim are stupid. They are now plundering our homes. And they are digging in our gardens. And they believe that we have left behind everything we had. And they are laughing at each other. But they do not know that we have taken the best.” “What’s the best?” the wind asks. The rabbi replies: “Our stories. We took them with us.” Mr. Hilsenrath was born on April 2, 1926, in Leipzig, Germany, the son of David Hilsenrath, a furrier, and Anna (Honigsberg) Hilsenrath. He was raised in Halle, in the east-central part of the country. By 14, he later recalled, he knew he wanted to be a novelist. Shortly before the Nazi violence against Jews on Kristallnacht in 1938, Edgar’s father fled to France and sent 12-year-old Edgar, his brother and his mother to live with his grandparents in Siret, Bukovina (now part of Romania). As the only Jewish student at his school, he was harassed and transferred to a parochial school. Notable Deaths 2018: Books A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 Three years later, after the territory was retaken by Romanian troops aligned with the Germans, the family was deported to the Moghiley-Podolsk ghetto in what the Romanians called Transnistria (now part of Ukraine), until it was liberated by the Russians in 1944. Typical of Mr. Hilsenrath’s unconventional storytelling, a blend of dread and drollery, was his account of how he started smoking. He was 17 at the time and had been captured shortly after escaping from the ghetto. “The soldiers put us in front of a machine gun,” he told the German daily newspaper Der Tagespiegel in 2006. “But they got scared because the Red Army approached.” With the firing squad disbanded, one soldier offered him a cigarette. “I’ve been smoking since then,” Mr. Hilsenrath said. To avoid being drafted into the Red Army, he fled with forged documents on a refugee train to Palestine, where he worked on a kibbutz (and caught malaria). He was reunited with his family in France in 1947. After arriving in New York in 1951, he worked as a waiter and a porter while writing fiction. He later became a United States citizen but returned to Germany in 1975 because, he said, he was feeling lost surrounded by speakers of a foreign language. His first wife, Marianne, died in 2004. His survivors include his second wife, Marlene Hilsenrath, who told the German news media that he died of pneumonia. In “Night,” which became a huge success in Germany a decade after it was published in English, Mr. Hilsenrath wrote about the most difficult conditions in the ghetto, in part, he suggested, out of a “guilty conscience.” Because he worked as a toolmaker, his family had been spared the worst. “Did you really feel guilty because things weren’t as bad for you as for others?” the Der Spiegel interviewer asked him. “I felt guilty,” Mr. Hilsenrath replied, “because I survived.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Edgar Hilsenrath, 92, Who Wrote of Misery In Nazi Ghettos, Dies.

arts This Week in Arts: ‘Stan & Ollie,’ Winter Jazzfest, Marie Kondo on Netflix  - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Arts Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Arts|This Week in Arts: ‘Stan & Ollie,’ Winter Jazzfest, Marie Kondo on Netflix Supported by This Week in Arts: ‘Stan & Ollie,’ Winter Jazzfest, Marie Kondo on Netflix By The New York Times Dec. 28, 2018 Film: John C. Reilly and Steve Coogan in ‘Stan & Ollie’ Dec. 28. John C. Reilly knows the value of a great partnership, and since September he’s doubled up in “Ralph Breaks the Internet” (with Sarah Silverman), “The Sisters Brothers” (Joaquin Phoenix) and “Holmes & Watson” (Will Ferrell). Now comes “Stan & Ollie,” opening Friday, Dec. 28 in New York and Los Angeles before a national rollout on Jan. 25. In it, Reilly plays the outsize Oliver Hardy to Steve Coogan’s diminutive Stan Laurel, snagging a Golden Globe nomination for best performance by an actor in a motion picture, musical or comedy. “Stan & Ollie” has plenty of both — the classic slapstick, the sweetly zany song-and-dance routines — as it follows the legendary duo through variety halls in 1953 Britain while the men try to jump-start their stalled careers. And their bickering wives (Shirley Henderson and Nina Arianda) say what their husbands dare not. But mostly it shines a light on the tender twilight of Laurel and Hardy’s enduring collaboration, and the hurdles — Hardy’s gambling and poor health, Laurel’s lingering resentment after Hardy briefly went solo — that threatened to stop the show. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Image Meshell NdegeocelloCreditVince Bucci/Associated Press Pop Music: Winter Jazzfest Takes Over Manhattan Jan. 4-12; winterjazzfest.com. It’s never hard to find jazz in New York City, where one night’s worth of bookings can range from classic bebop to the most outré fringes of the avant-garde. That might explain the sheer breadth of Manhattan’s largest and most forward-looking jazz festival, the Winter Jazzfest, which has steadily expanded steadily its founding as a one-day, one-location concert in 2005. This year’s edition supplements its two-day marathon on Jan. 11 and 12 (over 100 artists across 11 downtown venues) with a half one on Jan. 5, featuring a comparatively manageable six stages. The festival’s 2019 artist-in-residence, the genre-agnostic singer, bassist and bandleader Meshell Ndegeocello, will perform during both the full and half marathons. She will also helm a Prince tribute concert at Le Poisson Rouge (Jan. 4) and play from her own catalog at the intimate club NuBlu 151 (Jan. 10). In total, the festival shows jazz at its most expansive and inclusive: It’s the only Stateside jazz festival to participate in Keychange, a program that encourages festivals to reach gender parity in their lineups by 2022. NATALIE WEINER TV: Marie Kondo Sparks Joy on Netflix Jan. 1; Netflix.com. Haven’t heard of Marie Kondo and her mission to “spark joy” by decluttering the world? You must have been buried under a mountain of stuff. The Japanese Kondo achieved cultish devotion upon the 2014 publication of “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,” with its charmingly singular rule: Hold each item and if it doesn’t elicit a sensation akin to cuddling a puppy, then send it packing — but not before honoring its former place in your life with a “thank you.” Now, timed perfectly to resolutions season, Netflix is unveiling “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo” on New Year’s Day. In eight episodes, Kondo tutors Americans at pivotal points in their lives — a new marriage, a baby’s arrival, an empty nest, a husband’s death — in her KonMari Method, which advocates simplifying, organizing and storing in five categories (clothing, books, paper, miscellaneous, which she calls komono, and sentimental items). Then there’s folding, folding, folding, accompanied by crying, crying, crying. “I’m so excited because I love mess,” says an exuberant Kondo, who believes that a clean home results in happier relationships. Now, go thank your stuff and set it free. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Image Nora ChipaumireCreditIan Douglas Dance: American Realness Turns 10 Jan. 4-13, americanrealness.com. The dancers aren’t the only ones on the brink of exhaustion by the end of this jam-packed festival, which started 10 years ago as the brainchild of Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor. Mercifully, it’s a good tired. This year’s American Realness features new works by Miguel Gutierrez, Marissa Perel and Sujata Goel, along with five United States premieres. Eight encore productions include Gillian Walsh’s “Moon Fate Sin,” Nora Chipaumire’s “100% Pop/Shebeen Remix” and Jack Ferver’s “Everything is Imaginable.” Yet Realness, running 10 days at 12 venues across New York City, offers more than performances. Five lecture performances will explore ideas around creative practice and protest. And Emily Johnson’s “Kin” series, Jan. 5-10, at Performance Space New York will highlight the work of five Indigenous artists from Australia, along with the New York-based Muriel Miguel. The only problem will be fitting it all in. GIA KOURLAS Image A drawing by Don Freeman (circa 1950).

Don Freeman is most famous for his 1968 children’s book “Corduroy,” about a lonely department-store teddy bear finding a friend. The story is sweet but deeply melancholy, and Freeman’s illustrations, which combine saturated colors with a muscular line, have a beguiling gravity. The Californian transplant and Art Students League of New York alum, who died in 1978, also applied his talent to vistas of the city in the 1930s and ’40s. Examples at the Museum of the City of New York’s delightful holiday show include crowded El trains, children escaping hot tenement apartments on their fire escapes, bumper-to-bumper traffic in Columbus Circle and, as in this cartoon, backstage on Broadway. WILL HEINRICH Image John Noble CreditKarsten Moran for The New York Times Theater: John Noble in ‘Maestro’ Jan. 3-Feb. 9, romanticcentury.org. The great Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini was in his 60s when a gang of fascists assaulted him in 1931 Bologna for refusing to play their anthem. With Benito Mussolini in power at home and Adolf Hitler ascendant in Germany, Toscanini looked on in horror as European nations codified bigotry into law and hurtled toward war. Hitler once sent him a fawning letter, hoping in vain to lure him to perform at the Bayreuth Festival. Mussolini wiretapped Toscanini’s hotel room and, overhearing him decry anti-Jewish measures, had his passport taken away. Eve Wolf’s multimedia “Maestro,” a music-drenched historical drama that follows Toscanini through the ’30s and ’40s, mixes in an affair of the heart, too, as the world comes apart. Starring the leonine Australian actor John Noble (“Fringe”) as Toscanini, and produced by the Ensemble for the Romantic Century, the show is based partly on the conductor’s letters to his much younger lover. Performances start on Thursday, Jan. 3, at the Duke on 42nd Street in Manhattan. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Image Paavo JarviCreditVincent Tullo for The New York Times Classical Music: Paavo Jarvi at the Philharmonic Jan. 3-5; nyphil.org. The conductor Paavo Jarvi is a mainstay at the New York Philharmonic: This March marks the 20th anniversary of his first appearance with the orchestra, and last season he led a bracing account of Sibelius and Rachmaninoff. This week, Jarvi fills in last-minute, as the hotly anticipated debut of conductor Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla was postponed because of the birth of her first child. The dependably revelatory Jarvi will oversee a program including not only two repertory chestnuts — Dvorak’s Cello Concerto, with the soloist Gautier Capuçon, and Ravel’s “Daphnis et Chloé” Suite No. 2 — but also a lesser-heard movement from Sibelius’s enchanting “Lemminkainen Suite.” WILLIAM ROBIN Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword Cooking email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2019 The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions

arts At the Berlin Biennale, the Art of Saying ‘No’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|At the Berlin Biennale, the Art of Saying ‘No’ Supported by Art Review At the Berlin Biennale, the Art of Saying ‘No’ Image “Hapana Chitsva,” a triptych of paintings by Portia Zvavahera at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art, one of the three principal venues for the Berlin Biennial of Contemporary Art.CreditCreditGordon Welters for The New York Times By Jason Farago June 12, 2018 BERLIN — In the mid-1990s, when the world began to outsource the production of contemporary art to this “poor but sexy” capital, one exhibition in particular underlined Berlin’s emergence as Europe’s artistic hot spot. The Berlin Biennale, whose first edition took place in 1998, brought droves of artists and curators to the city’s dilapidated factories and warehouses, and advocated full throttle for the city’s young artists before Germany’s museums caught on. Berlin, though, is not what it was in 1998, and neither are biennials. Contemporary art has become one of the city’s key marketing tools for the Easyjet-and-Airbnb generation. And biennials are getting more homogeneous: You can encounter as much Berlin-made art in Venice, Istanbul or Taipei as you will here. Now 20 years old, the Berlin Biennale is facing something of an identity crisis, and really cracked up with its catastrophic 2016 edition — a fashion-fixated parade of narcissistic jokes, complete with posters snickering about fascism outside a former Jewish girls’ school. Nothing could be further, at least on the surface, from the last edition’s moral clownishness than the 10th Berlin Biennale, led by the South African curator and artist Gabi Ngcobo. It’s pleasantly small, with just 46 artists and groups, fewer than half the count of the last edition. This biennial is serious, low-temperature and rather distant; an insider’s show, and one that takes almost too much pleasure in saying “no.” Image Visitors take in video works by the artist Tony Cokes at the ZK/U Center for Art and Urbanistics, one of the venues for the Berlin Biennale.CreditGordon Welters for The New York Times Ms. Ngcobo first came to international prominence as part of the Johannesburg-based artistic collective known at the Center for Historical Reenactments. A majority of the artists she has invited to this biennial are African or have African heritage, living everywhere from Berlin to New York to São Paulo. They are joined by practitioners from Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, New Zealand, and just a few white Europeans. This reversal of “global” art exhibitions’ usual demographics led many journalists to preview this biennial as a postcolonial endeavor or a lesson in racial justice — which Ms. Ngcobo and her four fellow curators steadfastly and admirably refuse to deliver. The words “black” or “African” never appear in the show’s introductory wall texts. Racism is evoked only through the oblique phrase “a willful disregard for complex subjectivities.” Where the previous Berlin Biennale spewed forth images and pranks, this one withholds — offering a minimal presentation that evades stereotypes but rarely leaves a mark. It unfolds across three principal venues, the strongest of which, by far, is the Akademie der Künste art school. Here the young Kenyan photographer Mimi Cherono Ng’ok presents evocative images, some sapped of color and others saturated with it, of flowering plants or a young man gazing out a window. Sara Haq has made dozens of delicate reeds sprout through the wooden floor, in an act of ecological disruption that also has delicate beauty (though its groan-inducing title, “Trans-plant,” undercuts its poetry). Two Cuban artists provide historical ballast: Ana Mendieta (1948—85), represented by tender ink drawings of fruit and flowers, and the wonderfully rediscovered artist Belkis Ayón (1967—99), whose large black-and-white monoprints have a ghostly authority. Painting has a significant place in this part of the exhibition, for good and ill. Johanna Unzueta impresses with abstract compositions that draw on the forms of indigenous Chilean textiles. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye contributes half a dozen fictional portraits with, as usual, psychological acuity but overly hasty brushwork. Image The German artist Mario Pfeifer’s video installation “Again” casts a bitter eye on Germany’s refugee crisis.CreditGordon Welters for The New York Times Ms. Ngcobo refuses to assign these artists any overarching agenda or to articulate any political orientation. Still, politics are not absent, above all in this show’s most talked-about work: “Again,” a video installation by the German artist Mario Pfeifer that casts a bitter eye on the country’s ongoing refugee crisis. In 2016, four men in Germany’s eastern state of Saxony dragged an Iraqi refugee out of a supermarket where he was causing a scene and tied him to a tree. Video of the incident went viral, and many Germans defended the men’s actions as a selfless act of civil courage. The men faced trial but the case was thrown out, to the jubilation of supporters of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party; the 21-year old refugee, who had a history of mental illness, was found frozen to death in a forest before the trial. Mr. Pfeifer bracingly stages an all-strings-attached re-enactment — his fictional version fuses Brechtian alienation techniques with the showmanship of trashy German talk shows — to pick at both the alleged crime and the holes in its media representation. A pseudo-jury of volunteers watches the re-enactment and, like many of the spectators at the biennial, they recoil in horror. “Would it have happened with a German? I don’t know,” says one. “Nothing has changed.” Image "¿Dónde están los héroes?” or “Where Are the Heroes?” by Lorena Gutiérrez Camejo at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art.CreditGordon Welters for The New York Times Image Dineo Seshee Bopape’s “Untitled (Of Occult Instability) [Feelings],” combines smashed bricks, uncanny orange light, and footage from one of Nina Simone’s most chaotic concerts.CreditGordon Welters for The New York Times The quality varies more across the five floors of the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, in the Mitte district. Painting gets welcome attention here too, above all in a commanding triptych by the Zimbabwean artist Portia Zvavahera — whose ornate layered scenes of a floating bull and bride, as indebted to Klimt and Munch as to southern African printed textiles, are the best work this promising painter has done. Dineo Seshee Bopape, one of many South Africans in this show, fills the museum’s largest space with smashed bricks, uncanny orange light, and footage from one of Nina Simone’s most chaotic concerts, adding up to a disconcerting tableau of displacement, racism and madness. Yet much of the art in this part of the show feels underpowered, and that goes double at an unassuming art space in the west of the city, where the show really collapses. Heba Y. Amin films herself as a megalomaniac politician who envisions an African-Asian-European supercontinent; her fantasy appears tasteless when broadcast alongside speeches by real world leaders with actual malign designs. There is figurative work here that barely rises above the undergraduate level: garishly colored portraits by Lydia Hamman and Kaj Osteroth, and fantastical drawings of horned creatures by Tessa Mars more appropriate to a comic convention. Here we run up against the limits of Ms. Ngcobo’s anti-totalizing stance: It simply asks too little of artists, and allows her to pass off the most puerile of projects as an act of resistance. In political terms, there’s something quite appealing about Ms. Ngcobo’s imperiousness, and her steadfast refusal to give a majority-white German audience what it expects. She is right to scupper the art world’s expectations that certain artists and curators — black ones, queer ones, ones from the global South — must explain themselves, or, worse, teach others how to improve or atone. And in contrast to the fashionista reductions of the previous biennial’s curatorial team, Ms. Ngcobo’s high-mindedness makes welcome demands on us spectators, who have our own responsibility to look closely, think broadly, and learn our history at global scale. But there is a curious congruence between the smiling nihilism of the 2016 Berlin Biennale and the aloof refusal of this year’s: Neither offers enough of a positive vision of what an art exhibition, and what art itself, might actually be for. There’s no shortage of outrages to which an artist or curator should say “No” — but “No” has to be the beginning of an exhibition like this one, rather than an end in itself. In a round-table discussion printed in the catalog, Ms. Ngcobo quotes Toni Morrison’s essential dictum from 1975 about the price of racism: “It keeps you from doing your work.” All the more reason to celebrate the artists here — Ms. Zvavahera, with her gloriously agitated paintings; Mr. Pfeifer, with his rigorous and forensic analysis — who have opted for ambition over retirement. Correction:  A picture caption with an earlier version of this review misspelled the given name of an artist whose work is at the ZK/U Center for Art and Urbanistics. It is Tony Cokes, not Tomy. 10th Berlin Biennale Through Sept. 9; berlinbiennale.de.

arts London’s Theaters Tackle the Big Issue: Women’s Bathrooms - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|London’s Theaters Tackle the Big Issue: Women’s Bathrooms Supported by London’s Theaters Tackle the Big Issue: Women’s Bathrooms Image The Queen’s Theater in London will close for a while this summer to make way for the expansion of women’s bathrooms.CreditCreditDelfont Mackintosh Theatres By Alex Marshall Jan. 3, 2019 LONDON — The Theater Royal in Drury Lane — one of London’s most historic venues, tracing its origins back to 1663 — is closing this weekend for a $56 million refurbishment, in part to meet a very immediate need: for more women’s toilets (18, in this case). The nearby Old Vic will start a $4.1 million project this month that includes adding 12 stalls, while the Queen’s, home of “Les Misérables,” will shutter for a renovation this summer that will include 18 more places for women to use the bathroom. Last year, a host of Broadway theaters started excavating, annexing, converting and renovating their buildings to remedy the problem of long, slow lines to the bathroom, for men and women. Now many in London are doing or considering the same. They include the Novello, home of “Mamma Mia!,” and the Noël Coward, showing “The Inheritance.” A British theater publication this week put numbers to anecdotal evidence that going to the bathroom had become a major hassle at the theater. On Monday, The Stage published a survey of West End theaters that reported they were “caught short by subpar toilet provision.” Female theatergoers would need an hourlong intermission if they were all to make it in and out of the bathroom at an average London theater, according to the Stage report. Of the theaters surveyed, the National Theater — which had its last major redesign in 2015 — came out on top, with one toilet for every 20 female audience members. But accommodations dropped rapidly from there. The Donmar Warehouse, now showing Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Sweat,” only had one toilet for every 42 female audience members. The Old Vic had one for every 56 women. (The renovation will improve those numbers, an Old Vic spokeswoman said this week.) There is no obvious reason for the sudden bathroom obsession, said Rebecca Kane Burton, chief executive of LW Theaters, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s company, which owns seven West End spaces including the Theater Royal. Image The Old Vic Theater has set in motion a $4 million refurbishment project that includes adding bathrooms.CreditJonathan Brady/Press Association, via Associated Press But adding more bathrooms has always been at the forefront of redevelopment plans, she added in a phone interview. “I’ve been coming to the theater since I was a kid and I remember you had a choice of buying a bag of sweets or going to the toilet,” she said. “That shouldn’t be a choice.” London’s theaters sometimes have problems fitting in more stalls because they are often historically protected buildings that have to comply with a host of planning rules. But Ms. Kane Burton said individual theaters find ways to get more women through by “flipping” men’s toilets to allow women to use them. A sample of London’s female theatergoers on Wednesday night suggested most are resigned to waiting in line — or finding ways around the traffic. “I tend to go to the restaurant across the road,” said Mimi Monteith, a playwright having a cigarette outside the Duke of York’s Theater during the intermission for Tennessee Williams’s “Summer and Smoke.” “Theaters like this are wonderful as they’re so old,” Ms. Monteith added, “and there’s ones where you creep into an almost cupboard to go to the toilet. There’s something that is almost fun about it.” Should they try adding some portable toilets? “No, that’d be tragic,” she said. Similar views were found outside the women’s room in the basement of the Old Vic during the intermission of “A Christmas Carol.” “For the ladies, you always have to queue,” said Tami Alikhani, a child psychologist on a night out with her son. “I’m just grateful to be going to the theater.” A few minutes later, Fiona MacMichael exited the bathroom in a more positive mood. “We were in the pub before this and I got locked in the toilet and had to kick the door down,” she said. The toilet’s door had been lacking a handle on the inside, she said by way of explanation. “I didn’t have to do that here,” she added, “so this is much better.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: At London Theaters, a Focus on the Loo.

The new trailer for Marvel’s “Avengers: Infinity War” arrived this week, with an absurdly deep roster of stars appearing as extremely powerful superheroes for extremely short amounts of time. (The entire “Guardians of the Galaxy” cast got about two seconds onscreen.) Operating on a much more patient and modest level is “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” which centers on a spy agency of regular humans fighting supernatural forces; the show has generated unsexy but reliable reviews and ratings over four seasons. Season 5’s two-hour premiere finds Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his team stranded on a mysterious ship deep in outer space. What’s Streaming Image Louis Hofmann in “Dark.”CreditJulia Terjung/Netflix DARK on Netflix. This streaming service has put an emphasis on creating content from across the globe, and Friday marks the release of its first original German-language series. The show takes place in a small town next to a nuclear power plant; a young boy disappears and a body is found in the woods. The show possesses a sensibility specific to its country: “I don’t know if it’s German angst, but there is something uniquely creepy about Germans, at least from the outside perspective,” the writer Jantje Friese, one of the show’s creators, told The Times in an interview. EAST LOS HIGH on Hulu. This drama was one of Hulu’s first forays into original programming in 2013; it follows a group of Latino high schoolers in East Los Angeles navigating everything teenagers do in television shows — friendships, sex, drugs, family. After ending Season 4 with a huge cliffhanger, the show will bow out as Hulu’s longest-running series with this stand-alone one-hour finale. The plot picks up eight months later, as the group prepares to leave high school, and possibly Los Angeles, behind. HITCH (2005) on Netflix. New to Netflix: Will Smith stars as Alex Hitchens, a “date doctor” whose suaveness and charm are irresistible — until he meets Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), an unflappable, witty gossip columnist who seems impervious to his advances. The movie has plenty of dopey physical comedy, particularly from Mr. Smith and Kevin James, but also reveals a deeply romantic core.

For decades starting in 1966, the Colorado motel owner Gerald Foos spied on his residents through walls, mostly watching them have sex. He brought his story to the journalist Gay Talese, who waited 25 years to publish Mr. Foos’s queasy story in a book, “The Voyeur’s Motel.” But the book itself created a firestorm over its accuracy and moral integrity — how complicit was Mr. Talese himself in Mr. Foos’s reprehensible acts? This documentary, which debuted at this year’s New York Film Festival, features interviews with Mr. Foos and Mr. Talese as they wrestle with an onslaught of criticism and their own complex relationship.

Josephine Premice Fales in spring of 1966.CreditCreditCarl Perutz Supported by By Susan Fales-Hill Dec. 26, 2018 My late mother, Josephine Premice, was a dancer, singer, actress and quintessential New Yorker. She belonged to a coterie of black female performers — Lena Horne, Carmen de Lavallade, Eartha Kitt, Diahann Carroll — whose talents and complexity Hollywood rarely showcased. While they dazzled audiences in nightclubs the world over, and on stages from Broadway to the West End, they rarely appeared on the big screen. The movies had a preferred place for black women: standing behind a glamorous white star as her good-natured maid. But in the absence of a celluloid record, my mother lives on in an indelible reel in my head. Image Performing in the 1957 musical "Jamaica."CreditFriedman-Abeles/The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts Like a magical Christmas box, The New York Times photo archive added new frames to my memory movie. Images I’d never seen before brought back the turbulent times my mother traversed, and the lessons the journey taught her: that the greatest wealth is spiritual and cultural, that we can create redemptive beauty in every instant of every day and that even death cannot destroy the legacies of faith, hope and creativity. Born in Brooklyn in 1926 to political refugees from Haiti, my mother treated our home, New York and the world as her personal stage, always asserting her right to embody a multiplicity of cultures. Able to speak and sing in French, Creole, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese; dance everything from a mambo to a minuet; and whip up dishes from gumbo to steak au poivre, she was a walking melting pot. Image In 1974, she was called “the best Haitian cook in all of America” by The Times. CreditGene Maggio/The New York Times In a 1957 photo from the set of the Calypso musical “Jamaica,” she is a whirling marvel of youthful energy and swirling petticoats. That was the year she met my father, who was the son of a wealthy family from the Northeastern establishment. She was at the height of her professional success, toast of the stylish supper clubs where Paris and New York society swells rubbed shoulders nightly with glamorous performers of color whose effortless chic they relished. A head shot dated 1966 shows her shortly after our family’s return from Rome, where my parents had taken refuge from the hostile reaction to their interracial marriage in 1958. (Unlike many papers, The Times reported the union in factual, rather than lurid terms, never even noting the difference in race.) She was preparing to do a one-woman show and jump-start her career after an eight-year hiatus. Always one to defy American society’s expectations and attempts to confine her to an ethnic box, she publicized the show by belting out the ballad “La Mamma,” in Italian, on “The Merv Griffin Show."

The artistic was political to many black women of her generation, who used their gifts to advance the Civil Rights agenda. After the racial paroxysms of the 1967 riots, Joseph Papp’s mobile theater project sought to bring culture to the people, even if the people were not always ready for it. According to my mother, during one performance of “Black Electra,” adapted from Sophocles’s original, a drunken man stood up in the audience and complained, “Ladies, y’all are beautiful, but I don’t know what you’re saying.” Image As Clytemnestra in "Black Electra," a 1969 production of the Mobile Theater.CreditFriedman-Abeles/The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts In the 1970s, when her cafe-society sophistication was out of fashion and work opportunities were scarce, she continued to express her creativity through endlessly redecorating our apartment and preparing elaborate feasts. Raised by a mother who promised her, “You will enter a kitchen only to give orders,” she’d learned to cook by instinct and did it her way, refusing to use measuring cups or wear an apron.

July 24, 1975.CreditBill Aller/The New York Times The photograph of her with Lena Horne that ran alongside her Times obituary in April 2001 was a fitting tribute to her unflagging optimism. The bright-eyed 32-year old looking off to a distant horizon from the Broadway stage was a far cry from the 74-year old who ended her days tethered to an oxygen tank. But though her body had been ravaged by emphysema, her hope and faith in a future world of opportunity remained undimmed. She passed away in her own bed, in her own home on her beloved Upper West Side, declaring in her final days, “I am so lucky!” Hollywood never recognized her protean talents. But New York had provided the ideal stage for the master work that was her inimitable life.

arts The Best and Worst of the Golden Globes - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Movies Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Movies|The Best and Worst of the Golden Globes Supported by The Best and Worst of the Golden Globes Image Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh led off the show.CreditCreditPaul Drinkwater/NBC, via Associated Press Jan. 7, 2019 Read our updates and analysis from the Golden Globes ceremony. The Golden Globes on Sunday featured a number of upsets and rousing thank-yous as well as flubbed intros and snoozy speeches. Here are the highlights and lowlights as we saw them: Most Stirring Opening Speech After the Golden Globes hosts Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg delivered a largely safe opening, going out of their way to praise the work of Hollywood, Oh hit a surprisingly emotional note about representation in the film and television industry and gains in diversity onscreen and off. She was referring to several films this awards season that feature people of color, and her hosting gig was itself a barrier breaker: she was the first Asian woman to front a major American awards show. Oh told the crowd that she had signed on as host because “I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change.” She acknowledged that the progress could be temporary, saying, “I’m not fooling myself. Next year could be different.” But, she concluded, “right now, this moment is real.” As if to prove her point, the Globes rewarded a notably diverse group of actors, directors and stories. — Sopan Deb [Read a transcript of Sandra Oh’s comments.] Least Riveting Hour Image Samberg’s niceness roasts contributed to uneven pacing.CreditMike Blake/Reuters But Oh’s comments followed one of Samberg’s continuing niceness roast segments. It’s a fun enough idea, but it never quite landed, and segueing from that ironic niceness to Oh’s genuine earnestness just set everything off on a confusing, slippery start. The pacing never quite recovered. Presenters flubbed their intros, and commercials came at the wrong spots. The sound mix made it seem like the house was talking over the show, and even Carol Burnett couldn’t right the ship. — Margaret Lyons [Read our review of the Globes telecast.] Most Shocking Win (Especially to the Winner) Image Glenn Close accepted her award from Gary Oldman, the presenter.CreditNBC Universal Everyone expected the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama to go to Lady Gaga for “A Star Is Born” — including Glenn Close apparently. When Close’s name was read instead, the look of total surprise on her face provided one of the night’s most memorable moments. She went on to deliver a heartfelt personal speech, connecting the struggle of her movie character — a thwarted writer who lives in the shadow of her Nobel-winning husband — with her own mother, who, Close said, had a tendency to sublimate herself to Close’s father. Between her speech and Olivia Colman’s equally gangbusters acceptance for best actress in a comedy (for “The Favourite”), the super-stacked best actress race at the Oscars just got even more interesting. — Kyle Buchanan [Read about Close’s crowd-pleasing acceptance speech.] Second Most Shocking Win (Especially to ‘A Star Is Born’ Fans) Image Jim Beach, Roger Taylor and Brian May of Queen, Rami Malek, producer Graham King, and Mike Myers from “Bohemian Rhapsody.”CreditKevin Winter/Getty Images Going into Sunday’s ceremony, it seemed like “A Star Is Born” had a strong chance to take three top Globes. When Lady Gaga lost to Close, it was a shock but it didn’t seem like an omen. And when “Bohemian Rhapsody’s” Rami Malek beat out “A Star Is Born’s” Bradley Cooper for best actor in a drama, that seemed understandable. After all, Malek’s performance as Freddie Mercury had been widely praised. But when “Bohemian Rhapsody” was named best drama, “A Star Is Born” fans were not pleased. On social media there were digs at “Bohemian Rhapsody’s” credited director, Bryan Singer, who was replaced on the film and wasn’t thanked onstage Sunday. Perhaps one Twitter user put it best: “Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? How did best picture go to Bohemian Rhapsody? Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see Gaga deserved more than 1 win and 2 nominees.” — Stephanie Goodman [Read our critic on “Bohemian Rhapsody” vs. “A Star Is Born."] Least Stuffy Presenters Image Maya Rudolph proposed to Amy Poehler.CreditNBC Universal, via Getty Images Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph brought a welcome silliness to the stage, first by joking around about supporting actors as a category and then with a faux proposal from a hyper-jittery Rudolph. It was short and goofy and most of all it looked like fun, in contrast to the largely joyless and desultory intros that preceded it. — Margaret Lyons Biggest Retreat on the Red Carpet Image Rosamund Pike was one of several stars wearing bondage straps around exposed waists.CreditMike Nelson/EPA, via Shutterstock Sandra Oh noted that she saw change, but it was mostly back to business on the fashion front. To be sure, there were some suggestive trends. Julia Roberts wore the pants. Suffragist white was the biggest color of the night — though more provocative were the bondage straps that wound round the exposed waists of Rosamund Pike and Thandie Newton as if to suggest all stars are at the mercy of the red carpet rules. Yet as they chafe against the demands of the carpet, they still seem unwilling to fight it. That may be why the fun-with-fashion approach was left largely to the men, who seemed increasingly disinclined to play by the old rules. Instead there was color (Idris Elba, Spike Lee), print (Darren Criss’s florals), drama (Billy Porter’s bejeweled cape lined in bright pink silk), gender fluidity (Cody Fern), and just plain old weirdness (Timothée Chalamet’s Louis Vuitton “embroidered bib”). — Vanessa Friedman [Read more about the fashion at the Golden Globes.|See more photos from the red carpet.] Best Last-Chance Win Image The team from “The Americans” finally getting their due.CreditNBC Universal “The Americans,” which ended its six-season run last year, had been a critical darling since its debut, but it never seemed to get much award-show love — a shame, and a dumb shame at that. This was its last chance and thus a real relief when it won for best drama. Oddly, that award was handed out early in the telecast and without any buildup, so it seemed abrupt and hurried, but a win’s a win. — Margaret Lyons [Read about the finale of “The Americans.”] Best First-Chance Win Image Regina King accepting her award for “If Beale Street Could Talk.”CreditPaul Drinkwater/NBC After the SAG Awards snubbed Regina King’s wonderfully warm performance as the matriarch in “If Beale Street Could Talk,” I started to worry that Oscar voters might follow suit. Luckily on Sunday, the night before voting for the Oscar nominations begins, King took the Golden Globe for best supporting actress and reminded the industry that she comes by that humanity quite naturally, in an acceptance speech so authentic and progressive (she pledged to seek gender parity in all her projects) that the orchestra that began to play her off soon thought better of it. — Kyle Buchanan [Read Regina King’s acceptance speech.] Most Genuine Audience Reaction Image Sandra Oh’s father reacting to his daughter’s win.CreditNBC Not only was Oh a host, she was also a winner. She picked up a well-deserved award for her work on “Killing Eve,” and she seemed overjoyed — and still nowhere near as happy as her elated father, who leapt to his feet, clapping and beaming. It was completely charming, of course, but also a much-needed jolt of authentic happiness. Happy dads for all. — Margaret Lyons [Read about hosts winning awards at the Globes.] Least Rousing Lifetime Achievement Acceptance Speech Image Jeff Bridges with the Cecil B. DeMille Award.CreditReuters Last year, the Globes’ Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement went to Oprah Winfrey, and she brought down the house with an empowering, inspirational speech that had the audience on its feet before it was even over. This year, Jeff Bridges … well, didn’t. While it was interesting to learn about the actor’s 50-year working relationship with his body double, Bridges was a bit Dude-like in his inability to really make a point. I guess the acting work will just have to speak for itself. — Mekado Murphy Funniest and Most Sobering Lifetime Achievement Acceptance Speech Image Carol Burnett accepting the award named for her.CreditNBC Universal, via Getty Images Television has always felt like an afterthought at the Golden Globes. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association didn’t start giving out prizes for TV until 19 years into the awards’ existence. So it seems apt that it took more than half a century to get around to inventing a lifetime achievement award for TV. And yet it also seems right that the award be named after its first winner, Carol Burnett, who took the stage and ruminated on her good fortune to have been able to make a weekly variety show with a lot of moving parts. Burnett was poignant and touched. But she was also funny, bluish in fact. And her humor had a kind of vestigial power. She knew she represented a kind of rear-guard entertainment that is disappearing from television, despite there being more television than ever, and has vacated the movies. On “The Carol Burnett Show,” Burnett was a zillion different people and yet somehow always herself — this vivid, voluble weirdo technician. Two of the night’s big movie nominees — “Vice” and “Green Book” — were made by the writers and directors of “Dumb and Dumber,” “Shallow Hal,” “Anchorman” and “Talladega Nights.” They’d gotten serious of late — or at least less funny. Farce has given way to greeting card and jeremiad. Burnett, too, went dark for a spell — in movies. But seeing her accept her own achievement award was a reminder that it’s not just TV that’s an afterthought but maybe laughter, too. — Wesley Morris [Read more of Carol Burnett’s speech.] Best Public Service for Busy Celebrities Image Linda Cardellini receiving a “flu shot.”CreditNBC In one of the more offbeat gags of the night, Oh and Samberg had a special treat for the audience: flu shots! They were possibly going for the same kind of weirdness that Armie Hammer achieved with his hot dog cannon bit at the Oscars last year. Or it may have been just good public service. I mean, celebrities are busy. Techs in lab coats spread through the Beverly Hilton audience offering the shots, although they weren’t wearing gloves. Unsanitary! And based on the freely imbibing history of Globes participants, these probably weren’t the only shots some audience members took. Capping it off was Samberg’s directive to the anti-vaxxers in the crowd: “Just put a napkin over your head and we’ll skip you.” — Mekado Murphy Biggest Applause Lines Image Patricia Clarkson taking the stage for her win.CreditNBC Universal, via Getty Images Christian Bale, who won for playing Dick Cheney in “Vice,” on his newfound specialty, charisma-less politicians: “What do you think, Mitch McConnell next?” The presenter Tyler Perry on the audience at the Golden Globes: “Are the people as drunk as they seem?

arts For a Confident Debut, a Young Singer Turns to Schubert - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Music|For a Confident Debut, a Young Singer Turns to Schubert Supported by Critic’s Pick For a Confident Debut, a Young Singer Turns to Schubert Image The baritone Benjamin Appl, right, performing Schubert’s “Die Shöne Müllerin” with the pianist James Baillieu at the Park Avenue Armory on Sunday.CreditCreditDa Ping Luo Benjamin Appl NYT Critic's Pick By Joshua Barone Jan. 7, 2019 The Park Avenue Armory must really want you to know who Benjamin Appl is. Otherwise it wouldn’t have given such significant real estate — three concerts, three Schubert masterworks — to Mr. Appl, a 36-year-old baritone who, with these performances, is making his American recital debut. His concerts at the Armory’s intimate Board of Officers Room, which began with Schubert’s “Die Schöne Müllerin” on Sunday and continue with the composer’s “Schwanengesang” on Tuesday and “Winterreise” on Thursday, remind me of the pianist Igor Levit’s debut there in 2014. Mr. Levit made an entrance by daring to program Beethoven’s final sonatas; Mr. Appl has chosen some of the most well known, and revealing, works in the art-song repertory. And like Mr. Levit, who pulled off his American entree with confidence and preternatural maturity, Mr. Appl presented a masterly account of “Die Schöne Müllerin.” He had the exacting attention to text of an actor, the charisma of a seasoned storyteller and an agile voice that, while not fully formed, shows promise not only for this week’s remaining concerts, but also for what I hope to be more appearances here in the years ahead. Mr. Appl, born in Germany and based in London, comes much-hyped from Europe, as one of the last private students of the lieder master Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and the recipient of emerging artist awards, as well as honors for his first album with Sony Classical, “Heimat,” in 2017. He performs with the pianist James Baillieu, who on Sunday maintained clarity and avoided the muddle that often comes with “Die Schöne Müllerin” when it is transposed lower for the baritone voice. (The piece is written for a tenor’s range.) With text by the poet Wilhelm Müller, Schubert’s song cycle — which has the dramatic breadth of theater, and a vast melodic language — tells the story of a sensitive young miller who falls in love with the beautiful miller maid of the title, but is consumed by jealousy and, lost in his dark thoughts, drowns himself in a brook. The youthful Mr. Appl, with wide eyes and animated dimples, looked every bit the part of Müller’s Romantic hero. Over the course of the 70-minute performance his face increasingly shined with sweat and his sculpted hair lost its shape, a serendipitous parallel with the miller’s descent into histrionics. Yet he wasn’t overly dramatic. For the most part, Mr. Appl gave a direct reading of the piece, restrained and sublime in the final “Des Baches Wiegenlied,” and rationing theatrical moments for maximum effect: the unbridled joy of “Mein!,” the breathless rage of “Der Jäger,” the disturbing turn toward madness of “Am Feierabend.” That song — “Am Feierabend,” in which the miller is upset that his crush said good night to everyone, not to him only — showcased Mr. Appl’s greatest talents as a performer, yet revealed where he still has room to grow. His voice’s warmth didn’t quiet carry to the top of his range, and one outburst verged on barking. But the way he navigated the song’s transformation, from disappointment to obsession, was so gripping and troublingly real, I heard people all around me exhale afterward, as if Mr. Appl had rendered them breathless.

They Work With the Artists, Too. Supported by Kids Don’t Just See Art at This Show. They Work With the Artists, Too. Image Young museum visitors with “Tainted Siege,” a work by Sara Jimenez, who is one of four artists in residency at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan.CreditCreditAoomiephotography By Laurel Graeber June 28, 2018 A young girl with waist-length golden hair entered a small room where a woman sat at a spinning wheel. Fascinated, the girl approached the device swiftly. Although the scene was in a modern museum, it had the feel of a fairy tale. A powerful spell had indeed been cast, and it was working: Amelia Salenger, the 4-year-old visitor, was becoming enchanted by contemporary art. “Have you ever heard the story of Rumpelstiltskin?” the weaver, Deborah L. Morris, asked the child. “Do you want to see how this works?” Ms. Morris, 58, a fiber artist, may not spin straw into gold, but she achieves her own intriguing alchemy: spinning strips of plastic bags into yarn. On a table were miniature looms for children, and a small drop spindle. A wall displayed other materials and fabric Ms. Morris had created with young visitors: She does the warp; they weave the weft. Soon Amelia was busy, too. The two had met at “Art, Artists & You,” a groundbreaking new show at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan that is part gallery, part studio, part laboratory. The museum selected four professional artists — Ms. Morris; Sara Jimenez, 33, who works with found objects; Ezra Wube, 37, who explores technology and new media; and Yeon Ji Yoo, 40, whose medium is paper — and built them rooms within the exhibition. The museum requires the artists to occupy these studios a minimum of two days a week, for six hours at a time; at least one is present each day. About 40 finished pieces by these artists and their contemporaries fill the gallery, and a materials-stocked family studio, led by museum staff, accompanies each artist’s studio, so that children can work independently. Image Ezra Wube, who explores technology and new media in his works, is currently in residency at the museum. The program fosters interaction between the artists and children.CreditChildren's Museum of Manhattan “We wanted kids to be inspired by great art around them, and while they’re making art, to be inspired by the artists,” said Andrew S. Ackerman, the museum’s executive director. Choosing the artists, who receive stipends and will be replaced by a new group this fall, was a painstaking process: The museum wanted professionals who were not only comfortable with children but who also reflected the city’s cultural diversity. (Mr. Wube was born in Ethiopia; Ms. Yoo emigrated from Korea; Ms. Jimenez is Filipina-Canadian.) “We wanted to have the materials drive the process and focus on things that are very familiar to children,” added David Rios, the museum’s director of public programs and the show’s curator. At the same time, young people might never have thought of turning these items — string, balloons, castoff clothing, old cassette tapes — into art. “The kid who’s not comfortable drawing or painting learns that you can manipulate wire to solve a problem or create a design,” Mr. Rios said. Ms. Yoo recalled a little boy who was shocked to see her tearing paper. “He was like, ‘What are you doing?’” she said. “Well, you can make artwork by ripping things up, too.” This doesn’t mean that what’s on view lacks thematic sophistication. Ms. Yoo’s paper sculptures and Mr. Wube’s video art frequently deal with migration, while Ms. Jimenez’s assemblages often comment on colonialism. One of the artists’ challenges is how to communicate to children that their work is more than conglomeration. Image Deborah L. Morris, a fiber artist, working with children at the museum.CreditAoomiephotography Ms. Jimenez said she could explain her art by referring to storytelling, and that she might ask children to try repurposing found photographs: “If you were to put your own inspiration and fiction into that, what would you want to do and why?” The artists also gain from the residency. Both Ms. Yoo and Mr. Wube said they found it freeing. “I lose control of what I do, incorporating kids in my work,” Mr. Wube said. “That’s important. That’s how you can grow. Instead of staying circular, you grow in a spiral.” More Art Residencies Grown-up art is now a trend in children’s museums. Here are others featuring adult artists as models or mentors: BROOKLYN CHILDREN’S MUSEUM recently opened ColorLab, a permanent art-making space that introduces visitors to the methods and ideas of African, African-American and Afro-Caribbean artists, including Chakaia Booker, Wangechi Mutu and Jack Whitten. Presenting public programs on Thursdays and weekends, ColorLab will offer a 45-minute workshop on the science of color on Saturday and one inspired by Afro-futurism on Sunday. CHILDREN’S MUSEUM OF THE ARTS features both contemporary-art exhibitions and programs. Its current show, “Scale: Possibilities of Perspective,” has work by 10 artists, including Shahzia Sikander, Dustin Yellin, Sally Curcio and Patrick Jacobs. This Friday through Sunday, a drop-in workshop, “3-D Globes,” will invite visitors to create spherical dioramas inspired by Mr. Jacobs’s art. SUGAR HILL CHILDREN’S MUSEUM OF ART & STORYTELLING offers an artist a residency each year. On Saturday at 1 p.m., it will host an opening celebration, with art activities, for the show “Leslie Jiménez: Catch the Light!” Beginning in mid-July, Ms. Jiménez, who uses materials like glass and thread to make work reflecting her Washington Heights neighborhood, will be on-site for programs that help children catch the light, too.

arts Curator Who Shaped a Global View of Contemporary Art Is Leaving His Post - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|Curator Who Shaped a Global View of Contemporary Art Is Leaving His Post Supported by Curator Who Shaped a Global View of Contemporary Art Is Leaving His Post Image Okwui Enwezor had served as director of the Haus der Kunst in Munich since 2011, and was curator of a Venice Biennale and Documenta, Europe’s two leading exhibitions of contemporary art.CreditCreditAndreas Gebert/dpa, Via Associated Press By Jason Farago June 4, 2018 Okwui Enwezor, the Nigerian curator and critic whose exhibitions laid the groundwork for a new global view of contemporary art, stepped down Monday from his position as artistic director of the Haus der Kunst in Munich. The museum stated that he was resigning for health reasons, but did not elaborate. Mr. Enwezor, 54, had served as director of the Haus der Kunst since 2011. Bernhard Spies, the museum’s recently appointed chief executive, and Ulrich Wilmes, its chief curator, will lead the Haus der Kunst until a new artistic director is named. Mr. Enwezor emerged as perhaps the most influential curator of the last quarter-century through large-scale exhibitions that assessed art at a global scale. He first made his mark in Germany in 2002 as curator of Documenta, the once-every-five-year mega-exhibition in Kassel. As the first non-European to direct that show, Mr. Enwezor presented a panorama of world art that displaced Europe from its traditional central position, and interwove African, Asian and Latin American art into a cosmopolitan tapestry. In New York, Mr. Enwezor’s major exhibitions include “The Short Century,” a history of modern African art and decolonization movements, seen at MoMA PS1 in 2002; and “Rise and Fall of Apartheid,” an exhibition of South African photographers at the International Center of Photography in 2012. In 2015 he was curator of the Venice Biennale, becoming one of only two people to organize both that show and Documenta, Europe’s two leading exhibitions of contemporary art. At the Haus der Kunst, Mr. Enwezor drew acclaim for “Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945-1965,” an effort to tell a global narrative of art in the two decades after World War II. Established names like Jackson Pollock and Frank Stella hung alongside artists from Iran, Mozambique, China and Mexico. Mr. Enwezor’s tenure at the Haus der Kunst was tainted by a bizarre scandal involving a human resources manager who pressured employees to join the Church of Scientology, which is strictly monitored by the German authorities, though not illegal. The museum also faced funding problems, and in 2017 it appointed a managing director to lead the museum alongside Mr. Enwezor as artistic director. “There is never an ideal time to leave, but I am stepping down when the Haus der Kunst is in an artistic position of strength,” Mr. Enwezor said in a statement.

Sharon Van Etten planned to pause her music career to study psychology. She ended up starring in a Netflix series, scoring a movie, having a child and writing a new album, due in late January.CreditCreditJody Rogac for The New York Times Supported by By Joe Coscarelli Jan. 3, 2019 On a late November morning, the laid-back version of Sharon Van Etten serving coffee from a thermos at a quiet kitchen table was both a miracle and an illusion. Toys piled in a corner and a rocking chair from her own childhood revealed the momentary absence of a toddler, but little else betrayed the mix of chaos and ambition swirling just below the surface of Van Etten’s picturesque Brooklyn life. In a few hours, she would fly to Los Angeles to film a quick scene for the second season of “The OA,” the Netflix show that became her first professional acting job in 2016. On the way, she would use the quiet hours away from her young son to study for the final exams that loomed as she continued to pursue an undergraduate degree in psychology. There was also a new script that needed reading and an experimental film score in the works, but those were just the side gigs. At the same time, Van Etten, 37, was in the midst of returning to her day job as a singer-songwriter, plotting a music video shoot, getting ready for a tour set to begin in February and awaiting the imminent delivery of the finished vinyl for her fifth studio LP, out Jan. 18 via Jagjaguwar. Though typically understated, the album’s title, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” nods at Van Etten’s current juggling act — a tongue-in-cheek mantra for a multitasking mother who also happens to run the small business that is an independent band. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “Crazy, crazy, crazy,” Van Etten said, taking in the scope of her hectic but life-affirming last three years, which, ironically enough, began when she tried to press pause on her music career. “I can’t even believe we’ve done what we’ve done.” It’s Van Etten’s now-frequent use of we and our in conversation that best mark her transition from a solitary, searching singer, known for her languid, almost gothic breakup songs, to something fuller and less fragile — someone to be counted on, someone in charge of things. Together with her romantic partner, Zeke Hutchins, who was once her drummer and now works as her manager, Van Etten has undertaken what the couple characterizes as various adventures — acting, school, scoring, parenthood — each of which adds to her ongoing project: becoming a more well-rounded, more empathetic artist. “So much of creative work today is all about like, the solitary genius and sudden rise,” said Zal Batmanglij, who directed Van Etten in “The OA,” the Netflix sci-fi series. “But it’s the people who actually do the work, day in and day out, that are special. They’re after something deeper, their work gets better — things that aren’t necessarily super-fashionable right now. They last the test of time. That’s everyone’s reaction to Sharon.” “Remind Me Tomorrow” represents the singer’s journal on the path to getting whole. Nearly a decade on from her spare 2009 debut, “Because I Was in Love” — powerfully sad funeral dirges for the ghosts of toxic relationships — the new album embraces optimism, even when it sounds like end times. Written initially as love songs to Hutchins, the tracks only intensified as Van Etten finished the lyrics after giving birth, often working with headphones while staring at her napping son, who turns 2 in the spring. “It’s about my love and my fear and about me wanting to be better, but doubting myself a little bit,” said Van Etten, who has an easy, disarming manner that quickly brings people close. “It’s my job to be strong and positive so that he feels safe and protected, even given the state of the world.” (Van Etten, who was pregnant during the election of President Trump, recalled “trying not to cry because I didn’t want the baby to absorb my emotions.”) Image “I almost didn’t take it,” Van Etten said of her role on “The OA.” “I was doing this big dramatic pause with my band to go back to school and now I’m going to act? I’m such a phony!”CreditJody Rogac for The New York Times As she has expanded her artistic endeavors and emotional registers, Van Etten also found a fresh musical palette. While her early, softly strummed guitar songs were often gorgeous despite their brokenness, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” an album of hope, intimacy and perseverance, has jagged edges and a brooding swagger, built around droning synths and a propulsive rhythm section of studio musicians. “I just wanted to do something different,” she said. “And the band setup bored me so much: ‘This is where the bass comes in, this is where the drums kick in …’” She continued: “I love the slow build — that’s what I do. But I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats.” Much of Van Etten’s recent evolution can be traced back to Nick Cave. She cited the Australian rock singer’s drone-heavy “Skeleton Tree,” from 2016, along with avant-garde and electronic acts like Suicide and Portishead, while seeking her new sound. But Cave had a less direct impact, as well: It was on tour opening for him in 2013 that she and Hutchins became something more than collaborators. “When we realized we fell in love, we were like, O.K., we have to go home and figure out our lives and then make this record and we’ll come back to this and see how we feel,” she said, referring to “Are We There,” her previous release, from 2014. “It was the most adult thing. And the most torturous thing we could’ve done to ourselves.” On that same tour with Cave, Van Etten was noticed by a casting director who would later swoop in to disrupt her life further. Following many months on the road in support of “Are We There,” Van Etten began feeling detached from her music and exhausted by the constant grind of performing heartbreak professionally. But inspired by her immediately intimate rapport with often-wounded fans after shows, she decided to take a moment away from music to finish her bachelor’s degree with the hope of becoming a licensed mental health counselor. As she and Hutchins settled into their new relationship, Van Etten enrolled at Brooklyn College, alive with the possibility of a new life chapter. Two weeks into her first semester, she got a call asking her to audition for “The OA.” “I almost didn’t take it,” Van Etten recalled. “I was doing this big dramatic pause with my band to go back to school and now I’m going to act? I’m such a phony!” She’d been in “West Side Story” in high school in New Jersey, where she grew up the middle child of five. But distant dreams of Broadway aside, Hollywood was never a goal. To Hutchins, however, the show sounded like an adventure. In the script, the role of Rachel, one of four damaged captives kept in glass cages by a mysterious scientist, called for “the voice of an angel.” Brit Marling, who stars in “The OA” and created the show with Batmanglij, recalled being floored by a video of Van Etten’s audition, in which she delivered a dramatic monologue and then sang a cappella, opting for “I Wish I Knew,” the opening song from her first album. “When you watched her do the monologue what you felt is that she was not acting — and that’s the highest compliment you can pay an actor,” Marling said. “She’s an incredible artist and thinker and feels everything viscerally. It comes out in her music and in how she acts. There’s just no phoniness. It’s all real.” Batmanglij added of Van Etten: “She could tap into something — these deep reservoirs of empathy. She can make herself vulnerable.” Image Van Etten’s new album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” traces the last three years of her life. “It’s about my love and my fear and about me wanting to be better, but doubting myself a little bit,” she said.CreditJody Rogac for The New York Times She took the role, agreeing to defer her college enrollment. But the detours just kept coming. In addition to eventually getting pregnant and performing on an episode of David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” revival, Van Etten signed on to compose the score for the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann’s “Strange Weather,” working out of a practice space that she shared with the actor and musician Michael Cera. It was there, Van Etten was comforted to discover, that she could not help but write songs. “It’s still an outlet for me,” she said. “It’s my therapy.” Van Etten found herself gravitating to Cera’s Roland Jupiter 4 synthesizer, and writing more on keys when not working on the film. By 2017, she had a folder of more than 40 demos, including what she described as a whole country album and another of only piano ballads. But the batch that became “Remind Me Tomorrow” was the most experimental, with sonic references that were “the sort of things you don’t think of when you think of Sharon Van Etten,” said the producer John Congleton, who would go on to oversee the recording sessions in Los Angeles. “She seemed particularly excited that I was going for it,” said Congleton, who likened the new songs to abstract tone poems. “I wasn’t trying to make it Americana, or normalize it,” he added. “I wasn’t trying to wrangle her — I was embracing the wildness.” That allowed a churning track like “Jupiter 4” — with plain-spoken romantic lyrics like “I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting/my whole life for someone like you” — to come with a musical layer of dread, the kind that encapsulates how terrifying it is to fall in love and put down roots. (Van Etten’s composition was also recorded as “Jupiter,” an ’80s-ish pop jam, by the singer Donna Missal.) Other love songs on the album, like “Comeback Kid” and “Seventeen,” feel aimed at Van Etten’s younger self. While much of her songwriting output has been viewed through the lens of her earliest public origin story — an abusive relationship with a man who tried to stamp out her creative impulses — Van Etten’s new work is less about picking at tender scabs than the faded scars that served as a road map to now. “I think reflection is important,” she said, “but taking those experiences and moving forward is how I’ve gotten to be here.” She added: “It’s because of everything I’ve gone through that I’m a stronger person and was open and ready enough to accept the right kind of love into my life.” On the almost-Springsteen-esque “Seventeen,” she sings: Down beneath the ashes and stone, Sure of what I’ve lived and have known. I see you so uncomfortably alone. Wish I could show you how much you’ve grown. A few days after our first meeting, Van Etten was facing that nostalgia head-on as she scouted locations from her past for the track’s upcoming music video shoot. There were long-closed clubs on the Lower East Side, where she played some of her first shows, along with her early New York apartments sourced on Craigslist and too close to the rattling subway. Van Etten laughed about seeing her “hazy past in daylight,” but the stroll through memories was also something of a goodbye, as she and Hutchins had agreed that a move to Los Angeles in the new year was probably best for raising a child. “I’ve worked so hard to live here and now I can’t afford it,” she said. “The New York story.” But it wasn’t a tragedy. Van Etten said she was open to more acting following her forthcoming appearance in the second season of “The OA,” and has been working on writing comedy, including a personal project about a mother’s relationship with her babysitters. She even recently tried stand-up. And though she would most likely not have time to return to school until 2020, Van Etten added that she’s sticking to her plan to become a therapist by the age of 50. “By then,” she said, “I’ll want to settle down.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page AR10 of the New York edition with the headline: Back With a New Outlook, and Sound.

Ms. Young helped found the school after growing frustrated with the special education programs available for Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy.CreditCreditTim Mosenfelder/Getty Images By Richard Sandomir Jan. 4, 2019 Pegi Young, a late-blossoming folk-rock musician who was a founder of a school for children with severe physical and speech impairments, like her son from her marriage to the singer-songwriter Neil Young, a performer at its many star-studded benefit concerts, died on Tuesday in Mountain View, Calif. She was 66. Her brother Paul Morton said the cause was cancer. By the early 1980s, Ms. Young had grown frustrated with the special education programs available for her son, Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy in 1978. She began thinking about starting a school to better address his needs and those of other children who had largely lost the ability to speak. That inspiration led in 1987 to the Bridge School, an innovative institution in Hillsborough, Calif., that has since achieved global reach. Ms. Young founded it with the speech and language pathologist Marilyn Buzolich and Jim Forderer, who had adopted many special-needs children. At the school, about 17 miles south of San Francisco, children from ages 3 to 12 use augmentative and alternative communication techniques, including speech generators and manual communication boards, to help them articulate their thoughts and prepare to complete their educations in their local school districts. Vicki R. Casella, the executive director, said in a telephone interview that Ms. Young had a “determination to ensure that children like Ben have the opportunity to become active participants in their communities.” Dr. Buzolich added that Ms. Young’s experience as the parent of a child with special needs had been critical to the school. “Professionals often diss parental input, but the parent sees the whole child,” Dr. Buzolich said by telephone. “You can imagine the parents at the Bridge School saying to themselves, ‘She understands me, she knows what it’s like, she’s been there.’ ” The school runs an international teacher training program; implements its curriculum in developing countries; organizes conferences; and conducts research to measure the effectiveness of its educational strategies. “I take a tremendous amount of satisfaction with the knowledge that we’re changing lives for the better,” Ms. Young said in 2017 in an interview with AXS, a ticketing website. “It’s truly having a global impact.” The annual benefit concerts have been the source of much of the school’s funding. Over three decades, headliners have included Mr. Young, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Emmylou Harris, Pearl Jam, the Who, Lucinda Williams and Metallica. The last concert was in 2016. Margaret Mary Morton was born on Dec. 1, 1952, in San Mateo, Calif. Her father, Thomas, was an investment manager. Her mother, Margaret Jean (Foley) Morton, was a homemaker and a hospital auxiliary volunteer. Image Ms. Young performing at the 2014 Bridge School benefit concert. After many years of singing backup with her husband, she recorded her first album when she was in her 50s.CreditSteve Jennings/WireImage Pegi wrote poetry in high school and played guitar for pleasure, but she did not consider a career in music. She attended community colleges in Northern California but did not graduate. When she met Mr. Young, in 1974, she was working as a waitress near his ranch and living in a tepee with her dog. In his 1992 song “Unknown Legend,” Mr. Young sang, “She used to work in a diner / Never saw a woman look finer / I used to order just to watch her float across the floor.” They married in 1978. She occasionally sang backup for Mr. Young, most notably at the 1994 Academy Awards telecast, when he sang his Oscar-nominated song, “Philadelphia.” But it was not until she was in her 50s that she recorded her first album, “Pegi Young” (2007). She followed it with four more. The most recent, “Raw” (2017) — credited, like the previous two, to Pegi Young and the Survivors — was in response to her divorce from Mr. Young in 2014. He had begun a relationship with the actress Daryl Hannah, and they married last year. In one song, “Why,” Ms. Young sings: “Why’d you have to ruin my life? Why’d you have to be so mean? Why’d you have to tell me such lies? Why not be straight with me?” After the album’s release, Ms. Young said on NPR that she hoped the songs could help people get through difficult life passages. “It could be, you know, late-in-life divorce,” she said. “It could be death.” She added, “Loss and heartbreak are pretty universal.” In his review of “Raw” in Glide magazine, Lee Zimmerman wrote, “With songwriting assistance from guitarist Kelvin Holly and Spooner Oldham, Young creates a stunning story line, one that taps into feelings that are both bitter and unbridled.” In addition to her son and her brother Paul, Ms. Young is survived by her daughter, Amber Jean Young; her stepson, Zeke Young; two grandchildren; her sisters, Sally Morton and Judith Davidson; two other brothers, Michael and Brian Morton; her stepsister, Mary Ann Wolkomir; and her stepbrother, Kevin Kleczka. Although she had found her way in music, Ms. Young nonetheless viewed the Bridge School as her life’s work. “Three or four of our students now have graduated from college,” she told Speakers in Code, a music website, in 2016, “and I’ve been to every one of their graduations with huge pride of a mother hen for seeing the success that these students have enjoyed — that once they have left Bridge, there is continuum of success.” Ben Young became a successful organic egg farmer. “You know when you buy eggs in a grocery store, and even when you buy them from a good organic source, you notice the yolks are kind of pale?” she said with pride. “Ben’s eggs are nuclear orange.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Pegi Young, 66, Musician Who Started School for Disabled.

Oh, this is so fantastic. And Annapurna, thank you so much, everyone. I mean, this is odd, but it’s not.

Goode/Spoleto Festival USA By Gabe Cohn Jan. 3, 2019 In 1987, the directors Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser had their debut at the genre-hopping Spoleto Festival USA with a restaging of Richard Strauss’s operatic Oscar Wilde adaptation, “Salome,” set in 1930s Germany. This year, the pair — now festival regulars — will return with another reimagining of “Salome,” set in the present day, one of more than 140 opera, theater, dance and music performances that will take place at the 43rd iteration of the festival this spring. The festival, in Charleston, S.C., is known for bringing together artists from many mediums. This year, it runs from May 24 through June 9. Some other highlights this year include a performance of the composer Joby Talbot’s vocal work “Path of Miracles” staged by the director John La Bouchardière, a performance by the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company and productions of the Shakespeare plays “Twelfth Night,” “The Comedy of Errors” and “Pericles” from Shakespeare’s Globe. During some of the Globe’s performances, there will be a surprise element — audience members will get to collectively choose which of the three plays they would like to see performed. A testament to the festival’s diversity of genre is the fact that those shows will not be the only place in the festival that Shakespeare’s ideas can be heard. The conductor Evan Rogister will lead a program of selections from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet” orchestra suites. “We want to make people think of these as human stories rather than as a piece of dance or a piece of theater or a piece of music,” Nigel Redden, the festival’s director, said in a phone interview. Genre-straddling musicians including the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding and the folk band the Punch Brothers, are also featured on the lineup, as is “Pay No Attention to the Girl,” Target Margin Theater’s riff on “The One Thousand and One Nights.” Naturally, they won’t be the only ones there riffing on that work: The Beirut-based company Caracalla Dance Theater will perform the United States premiere of “One Thousand and One Nights,” a dance adaptation of those stories.

McFadden Jan. 4, 2019 Christine McGuire, the eldest of the singing McGuire Sisters, who struck gold on the pop charts in the 1950s with “Sincerely,” “Sugartime” and other close-harmony hits that won young American hearts not quite ready for rock ′n’ roll, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 92. Ms. McGuire’s family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday. No cause was given. With their identical dresses and hairdos, synchronized movements and sweetly innocent voices, the McGuire Sisters — Christine, Dorothy and Phyllis — were the musical embodiment of popular culture in their day, singing for audiences who watched “Your Hit Parade” on television and listened to Perry Como, Patti Page and the lingering postwar strains of the big band era. After appearing on “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” in 1952, the McGuire Sisters soared to national fame. They were regulars on Mr. Godfrey’s morning shows for six years and remained one of the nation’s most popular vocal groups into the 1960s, singing on television, in nightclubs and on records that sold millions, even as teenage rebellion, Elvis Presley and rock ′n’ roll transformed the music world. The fashion-conscious Christine chose the sisters’ matching wardrobes, Dorothy kept track of finances, and Phyllis did most of the talking for the trio. Their million-selling records included two No. 1 hits, “Sincerely” in 1955 and “Sugartime” in 1958. Like other white performers of their generation, they recorded what critics called blander (but often better-selling) covers of rhythm-and-blues hits by black artists. In 1965, Phyllis McGuire’s idealized image was shattered by a grand jury appearance that exposed her longtime affair with a Chicago mobster, Sam Giancana. By then, the sisters’ popularity had begun to fade, and in 1968 the trio broke up, Christine and Dorothy to raise families and Phyllis to perform solo. But they made a successful comeback in 1985, and went on to perform for almost two decades at casinos and clubs in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and elsewhere, capitalizing on the nostalgia of fans who aged with them. Their last gig was a 2004 PBS special, “Magic Moments: The Best of ’50s Pop.” Ruby Christine McGuire was born in Middletown, Ohio, on July 30, 1926, to Asa and Lillie (Fultz) McGuire. Her father was a steelworker and her mother a minister of the First Church of God in Miamisburg, Ohio. Christine, who rarely used her original first name, took piano lessons for eight years. She and her sisters began singing for weddings and other services at their mother’s church in 1935. They later sang at hospitals and military bases. Discovered on local television, they went to New York City and climbed to fame on Mr. Godfrey’s popular TV shows. They had their first Top 10 record, “Good Night, Sweetheart, Goodnight,” in 1954. Christine McGuire was married four times. Her marriage to Harold Ashcraft in 1942 ended in divorce in 1950. They had two sons, Harold and Asa. In 1952 she married John Teeter. They were divorced in 1962. Her 1967 marriage to Robert H. Spain, a financier, also ended in divorce. In 2002 she married David Mudd, a Long Island vintner, who died in 2011. Asa Ashcraft died at 68 in 2015. Dorothy McGuire died in 2012. Ms. McGuire is survived by her son, Harold Ashcraft; her sister, Phyllis; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. One grandchild, Cpl. Evan Asa Ashcraft, was killed in the Iraq war in 2003 when an Army vehicle he was in was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade near the northern city of Mosul. The McGuire Sisters performed for Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and for Queen Elizabeth II. They entered the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009. Correction:  An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a son of Christine McGuire who died in 2015. He was Asa Ashcraft, not McGuire.

arts In ‘Grey Rock,’ a Palestinian Playwright Tackles the Ordinary - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Theater|In ‘Grey Rock,’ a Palestinian Playwright Tackles the Ordinary Supported by In ‘Grey Rock,’ a Palestinian Playwright Tackles the Ordinary Image Amir Nizar Zuabi’s play “Grey Rock” is about a Palestinian man who decides to build, in a shed, a rocket to the moon.CreditCreditMichael Kirby Smith for The New York Times By Alexis Soloski Dec. 30, 2018 Before rehearsals for Amir Nizar Zuabi’s “Grey Rock” could begin, refugee camps had to be visited, apartments had to be rented, checkpoints had to be passed and an uncertain, monthslong visa process had to be completed. “Grey Rock,” which starts performances on Thursday at La MaMa in Manhattan, is about a Palestinian man who decides to build, in a shed, a rocket to the moon. A play performed by Palestinian actors — they all identify as Palestinian, though some passports say Israel and one says Jordan — and co-produced by the Remote Theater Project, its journey to New York was not exactly nonstop. “Almost as nerve-racking as the M.T.A. system,” Mr. Zuabi said with a deadpan on a recent afternoon. “Almost.” While Israeli companies and plays are a common presence in New York, plays by Palestinian companies or on Palestinian themes are rarer and often a source of controversy. In 1989, the Public Theater canceled a Palestinian play, with then-artistic director Joe Papp claiming, “I didn’t want to make a statement at this particular moment by presenting a play dealing with the Arab-Israeli world from a Palestinian point of view.” In 2006, New York Theater Workshop effectively canceled a production of “My Name Is Rachel Corrie,” a play about an American activist killed in the Gaza Strip. In 2017, when New York University staged “The Siege,” reportedly destined for the Public Theater at one point, the Anti-Defamation League and the World Jewish Congress protested. “Grey Rock,” a simple and somewhat allegorical story, is less overtly political than any of these pieces. “It’s an invitation to peek into who we really are,” Mr. Zuabi said. Having spent the late fall rehearsing in Ramallah, a Palestinian city in the West Bank region, Mr. Zuabi and his cast were now stumbling through the play on the fifth floor of a building on Great Jones Street: creaking floors, tin ceilings, windows streaming smudged winter sunlight. Mr. Zuabi’s last play, “Oh My Sweet Land,” centered on the making of savory kibbe, but here the snack table held mostly sweets, including two Bundt cakes to celebrate two different birthdays. A filter dripped coffee into a thermos. The cast complained it wasn’t strong enough. Image Though all the actors, including Alaa Shehada, left, and Fidaa Zaidan, are fluent in English, performing a play in a language other than their native Arabic was a daunting experience.CreditMichael Kirby Smith for The New York Times The actors spoke the lines in English, and Mr. Zuabi gave direction in Arabic. “There’s something about the intimacy and the preciseness that I can achieve in Arabic,” he said. The actress Fidaa Zaidan had a hushed word with Alexandra Aron, the play’s American producer. She wanted to know if she ought to say “chicken roast” or “roast chicken.” After working several scenes and breaking for hand-rolled cigarettes — “Take 10 minutes. American minutes, not Palestinian minutes,” Mr. Zuabi called after his departing actors — they sat in a rough circle with Ms. Aron and discussed the particular challenges the play presented. Two years ago, Ms. Aron, a producer and director who first learned of the Palestinian theater scene while directing in Israel in the mid-’90s, and Mr. Zuabi began to talk about a commissioned piece. It would explore, Ms. Aron said, “this question of what influence the U.S. has had on Palestine, on thinking and consciousness and not in just a political way.” “Don’t get arrogant,” Mr. Zuabi chided. “It’s not a one-way relationship.” (As he later explained in an email: “Our land has produced the foundation blocks of Western civilization. The idea of one god was hatched in our neck of the woods.”) There were straightforward ways to approach this relationship. “You’re aiding our occupiers with lots of money and weapons,” Mr. Zuabi said. But while he isn’t shy about articulating his politics — “I’m very anti-Israel, I’m occupied and I don’t like it” — polemics don’t interest him artistically. He began to think instead about the 1969 moon landing. “It’s a moment that encapsulates all of the American values,” he said, adding, “the bravura, the nothing-is-impossible attitude, the technological superiority.” “It’s almost a reversal of who we are,” he said. So what would it mean for a Palestinian man to attempt it? Beginning in December 2016, Mr. Zuabi began workshops and structured improvisations in Haifa, Bethlehem, Jenin and Ramallah with the explicit goal of finding a diverse group of Palestinian actors. Once a shortlist of actors had been assembled, the visa process to come to the United States began. In November, the company of five actors, with U.S. visas secured, moved to Ramallah, rooming together to avoid traveling back and forth through Israeli checkpoints, and began to rehearse. Image Mr. Zuabi, with the actor Motaz Malhees, isn’t shy about articulating his politics — “I’m occupied and I don’t like it” — but polemics don’t interest him artistically.CreditMichael Kirby Smith for The New York Times Mr. Zuabi had written the play in English to make the story and its characters more accessible to a New York audience. Though the actors are all fluent in English, asking them to perform it was like asking them to swim with hands tied behind their backs and legs weighted, Mr. Zuabi said. “But somehow they’re still floating,” he said. Ms. Zaidan said that she had to learn her speeches in Arabic first, mingling her emotions and mental imagery with the words. Only then could she act them in English. “It was really weird for us,” the actor Alaa Shehada said as his castmates laughed. “In Arabic we emphasize everything! In English, no.” But even in English, the actors were eager to work on a play that showed Palestinian characters living in relative peace. “As a Palestinian, you are always afraid of being identified as a fighter or a terrorist,” Mr. Shehada said. “Or an occupied victim,” Mr. Zuabi added. “Here, there is no bombing, there is no shooting,” the actor Motaz Malhees said. “This time there is something genius.” The play doesn’t ignore the realities of occupation. Checkpoints are mentioned, and so are visas. There’s the possibility of a military incursion by Israel. But these are ancillary concerns. “They’re present in the play like they’re present in our lives,” Mr. Zuabi said. “We don’t live these political headlines. We have boring, normal lives.” “This is a show about people,” he insisted. It’s about the relationship between a father and a daughter, a mentor and an apprentice, a woman and her suitors, he said. “The truth is we represent nothing,” he said. But building a rocket is also a clear allegory for making art, for creating something so extraordinary that the whole world must notice. “If someone can get a rocket to the moon from Palestine, it’s a celebration of our creativity, of our ingenuity,” the rocket builder Yusuf says in the play. “It proves that we can be something.” Mr. Zuabi allowed the metaphor. “Making theater shows in Palestine” — with a limited infrastructure and lack of state funding — “sometimes feels like building rockets,” he said. “But when they take off, it’s glorious.” Runs at La MaMa from Thursday through Monday.

arts Cornelia Street Café, a Pillar of Greenwich Village Experimentation, Closes Its Doors - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Music|Cornelia Street Café, a Pillar of Greenwich Village Experimentation, Closes Its Doors Supported by Cornelia Street Café, a Pillar of Greenwich Village Experimentation, Closes Its Doors After almost 42 years, the club, which hosted jazz, comedy, burlesque, “The Vagina Monologues” and more, falls victim to rising real estate costs. Image After nearly 42 years in the West Village, the Cornelia Street Café has shuttered.CreditCreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times By Giovanni Russonello Photographs by Gabriella Angotti-Jones Jan. 4, 2019 Suzanne Vega sat backstage at the Cornelia Street Café on New Year’s Day, remembering when she had first stepped into it almost four decades ago. She was 20, an undiscovered talent, and it was a Monday night. She had come to try out material on the young troubadours and folk-revival survivors who attended the weekly Songwriters Exchange there. The cafe had sprung up in 1977 on a little side street in Greenwich Village, where foot traffic overtakes the asphalt in summer, and the arched doorways give the block a European feel. The club quickly became an heir apparent to the Village’s old coffeehouses, which were peopled by poets and folk songsters in the 1950s and ’60s. But Vega didn’t remember it as a nostalgic place. “We felt ourselves to be modern and of the moment,” she said. If you wanted to perform at the Songwriters Exchange, it had to be your own music. “It had to be current stuff,” she added. These have been constants at the club over nearly 42 years: an aura of inheritance and an ethic of freewheeling invention. But its history is coming to an end. As she spoke, Vega had just finished playing as part of the space’s farewell show, in which dozens of musicians, comedians, actors and poets took turns giving their final performances. The tiny basement can hold about 80, but that night it was packed well beyond capacity. Image Gilad Hekselman and Friends, featuring the saxophonist J.D. Allen, performing at one of the club's last shows.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times Image Adam O'Farrill, on trumpet, playing with his father, the pianist Arturo O'Farrill, at Cornelia's farewell show.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times After that marathon concert, which ran from 3 p.m. into the wee hours, one of the Village’s most creatively eclectic spots closed its doors for the last time. The cafe’s owner, the writer Robin Hirsch, who started it along with two other artists, is shutting down reluctantly in the face of soaring real estate costs. The restaurant upstairs has continued to thrive, and he has had no trouble booking more than 700 shows a year in the basement. But the monthly rent, $33,000, is now 77 times what it was when the cafe began, he said, and he cannot make ends meet. Cornelia Street Café’s demise is more than the disappearance of a gleaming old dot on New York’s cultural map. The cafe picked up on the coffeehouses’ legacy, certainly, but it expanded beyond that, particularly after a reading in the mid-1980s by Eugene J. McCarthy, the former Democratic senator from Minnesota, a lion of the political left and, as cafegoers found out, a sometime poet. That event led Hirsch to clear out the basement and move the performance space downstairs. Image A portrait of a blind cat, by Nathalie Schmidt, being removed from a dining room wall during Cornelia Street Café’s last day.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times Since then, the basement has been home to Off Off Broadway shows (Eve Ensler read “The Vagina Monologues” there for the first time in the mid-1990s), stand-up comedy, burlesque and a dizzying range of music. It was one of an increasingly rare breed of spaces that welcomed performers of many stripes, united only by an affinity for the offbeat.

Reflecting on the importance of the club — where he held a weekly residency in the mid-2000s — he mentioned its openness to improvisers of all sorts. “There’s a conduit for fringy jazz, and there’s a conduit for conservo-jazz,” he said. “There’s almost no conduit for people who straddle both worlds, which I’ve always found really problematic.” Asked what other locations might fill the void, he threw out a few names in the other boroughs (Bar Lunático and iBeam in Brooklyn, Terraza 7 in Queens), but acknowledged that none were small clubs dedicated to close listening and communion, in the way of Cornelia Street Café. Image Hekselman performing at one of Cornelia Street Café's final events.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times Image It wasn't unusual for a performance at the cafe to elicit an emotional response.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times A few weeks before, Cornelia Street had hosted Aaron Burnett and the Big Machine, a band playing sharply cut postbop with a loose, insurgent energy. It was celebrating the release of a new album, “Anomaly.” In the audience, Esperanza Spalding chatted animatedly between songs with the pianist Michele Rosewoman. Last Sunday was the club’s last bona fide jazz set. A crowd that included music journalists, indie-label executives and poets had lined up outside the door to hear the Tom Rainey Trio. Rainey’s trio — with Mary Halvorson on guitar and Ingrid Laubrock on tenor saxophone — had made the cafe its creative home over the past decade, performing there intermittently and honing a rapport that has so far resulted in three impressive albums. Like many of the cafe’s regular bands, it has a sound that’s hard to pin down, adhering to a tuneful but open-form style of its own. Image Robin Hirsch, who was one of the founders of the cafe in 1977, receiving a hug after an emotional speech.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times Over the course of an hour on Sunday, Halvorson’s paint-splattered distortion and Laubrock’s spare melodies — sometimes coolly linear, sometimes sharply splintered — felt constantly lifted by Rainey’s rambling, buoyant drums. Throughout the narrow basement, where cellphone signals don’t reach and the soft glow of colored Christmas lights filled the room, the audience leaned in close to hear every last note.

arts Grammy Nominee Brandi Carlile Has ‘Never Won Anything, Not Even a Karaoke Contest’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Music|Grammy Nominee Brandi Carlile Has ‘Never Won Anything, Not Even a Karaoke Contest’ Supported by Grammy Nominee Brandi Carlile Has ‘Never Won Anything, Not Even a Karaoke Contest’ Image “By the Way, I Forgive You” was “something that I poured my heart and soul into,” Brandi Carlile said. “To see it recognized this way is stunning.”CreditCreditAmy Harris/Invision, via Associated Press By Joe Coscarelli Dec. 7, 2018 Since 2005, the folk and Americana singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile has quietly put out albums that are well-received by critics and her fairly modest fan base — Barack Obama included — and that was enough for her. She landed the occasional song on a big soundtrack and in 2015, she was nominated for her first Grammy, best Americana album. Her LP “The Firewatcher’s Daughter” didn’t win, but it was a big deal nonetheless. On Friday morning, all of that became prelude as Carlile woke up to find that she had been nominated for six Grammy awards in 2019, including album of the year. She’s the most nominated female artist, and behind just Kendrick Lamar and Drake overall. Her most recent album, “By the Way, I Forgive You,” was released in February and will compete against those rap stars — plus Post Malone, Janelle Monáe, Cardi B, Kacey Musgraves and H.E.R. — for the biggest prize of the night, while her empowerment ballad “The Joke” is up for record of the year, song of the year, best American roots performance and best American roots song. [Kendrick Lamar leads nominees and women dominate major categories: see the full story.] Carlile took a break from responding to a flood of text messages to speak by phone with The New York Times about her shocking morning. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Who do you think was more surprised and confused this morning: you or fans of Post Malone? I don’t know, I saw a lot of pictures of Belinda Carlisle and some pretty solid misspellings, so I imagine it was equal doses of shock all the way around. How did you find out? [My publicist] called me at 5:30 in the morning and I just stumbled over to my home alarm and started trying to disarm it so I could walk out of the room, because I didn’t want to wake up my baby. Honestly, I didn’t know if I was awake — I was in absolute disbelief. Within 15 minutes, I had about 130 texts. How would you describe Brandi Carlile, the artist, for those people who are finding out about you for the first time? Well, I’m 37, I have a wife and two kids, and I’ve been doing this since I was a child. I’ve put in my fair share of miles and time in a van and this is for all intents and purposes, in my opinion, my seventh album and something that I poured my heart and soul into. To see it recognized this way is stunning. You’ve said that “By the Way, I Forgive You” is about “radical forgiveness” toward all of the people who may have wronged you in various ways throughout your life. But was there anyone you thought of this morning, in a flash of pettiness, like, “Oh, man, I showed you!” Be honest. Totally — three or four. Actually we were just talking about that and I was like, “I won’t even let their names pass my lips because the gratefulness is the lesson I’m learning most from this day.” I realized all along that I really essentially am a privileged white person in America who’s never had anything other than my dreams come true. Even though I did work really hard, I have perspective on this. And I wouldn’t by any means say I deserve it. [Who got snubbed, and whose nomination was a big surprise? See the round table.] Did you have a sense in crafting this record with the producers Dave Cobb and Shooter Jennings that it might be a breakout for you? You’ve had commercial success before — a song on “Grey’s Anatomy,” for instance — but this feels like another level. I thought it might emotionally be a breakout for me. I was reading a Joni Mitchell interview about the emotional state that she was in when she came to believe that it was time for her to write a record like “Blue,” where it wasn’t observational, but personal revelations. I knew it was that for me, and it was the first time I wasn’t hiding behind phrasing and punch lines and jokes. But in terms of something like this, no, it never even crossed my mind. I’m a chicken farmer. I’ve never won anything, not even a karaoke contest and I’ve been in a lot of them. You make music in a more traditional mode than someone like Post Malone, who is drenched in Auto-Tune, or Cardi B, who came up on Instagram, and we all know which direction the Grammys biases tend to go. Does any part of you worry about being the more niche, left-field spoiler, like Esperanza Spalding, Beck or Bon Iver? No. Not at all. At the end of the day, especially right now in this country, people want truth and forgiveness and healing. Those things aren’t coming from me, but anything that alludes to them, I think, draws people in at the moment. That’s what we’re seeing. Are there artists in the main crop that you’re a fan of? Every single one of them. I’m obsessed with Kendrick Lamar and Drake. And I cannot stay off Cardi B’s Instagram. My wife has a policy: No Cardi B Instagram in bed because it will wake up the kids. In “The Joke,” you have this line: “You get discouraged, don’t you, girl? It’s your brother’s world for a while longer.” Where did that come from? I was in London on Election Day, two Novembers ago, and I woke up just feeling so utterly exposed. For eight years, I’d been so comfortable in my politics because I felt like we had a president that represented my worldview in way that I didn’t need to say or do much. I just remember this sense of shame when I woke up in another country and saw what happened in mine. I started thinking about those words then, before it was ever a song. And I knew that it would awaken a generation of activists and that if it was my brother’s world, it wouldn’t be for long. After a year in which the Grammys faced a lot of backlash for its gender representation, how does it feel to have a song that’s kind of about those same ideas nominated in all the big categories? Does it feel like an apology from the Academy to womankind? I think it’s a shift in the collective consciousness — of the voters and the administrators, and it’s a conversation that just kind of took place in the astral plane of sorts. I know I sound like woo-ey old lesbian, but it happened and we’re seeing evidence of it today. Unlike some other awards shows, the Grammys have not really been a stage for resonant protest in recent years, despite the upheaval in the country. As a gay woman in America in 2018, can you imagine bringing politics to the show in your time onstage? In the music I can. I’ve been twice and seen Kendrick Lamar just completely — literally — set the place on fire. I find those the most inspiring performances by far. Because it reflects a time for me in music when musicians were activists and activists were musicians during the Vietnam War. I don’t know if it’s because of the devastation we’re seeing in the landscape of American politics and the Supreme Court, but I think for the first time, the music matters again like it did then. And the people that are leading the charge, in my opinion, are African-Americans, women and artists pushing the envelope outside of the boundaries of genre. Does your daughter know yet about the nominations, or care? I told her this morning and she didn’t give a [expletive].

She was 99. Her death was confirmed by her sons, Niko and Antonio Elmaleh. In the 1930s, Ms. Osato was a groundbreaking presence in Col. Wassily de Basil’s Ballets Russes, the world’s most widely known ballet company. She was the company’s youngest dancer when she joined, at 14; she was also its first performer of Japanese descent. She danced in the early 1940s with the Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater), where her dramatic projection left an impact on Antony Tudor’s ballets. She was Rosaline in his “Romeo and Juliet” and a woman of easy virtue in his “Pillar of Fire.” Ms. Osato received a Donaldson Award for best female dancer for her performance in the 1943 show “One Touch of Venus,” choreographed by Agnes de Mille, which starred Mary Martin as the statue of a Greek goddess that comes to life in modern Manhattan. She was the original Miss Turnstiles — a takeoff on Miss Subways, a real beauty-contest promotion that the New York transit system once ran — in “On the Town,” choreographed by Jerome Robbins, in which three sailors on a 24-hour pass in Manhattan experience the fleeting romances of wartime. But the war years proved a wrenching time for her, notwithstanding her professional success. Her father had been confined under military guard in Chicago as an enemy alien. Her brother, Tim, had been enlisted to fight in Italy with the Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Ms. Osato had just finished dancing as the Lilac Fairy in the Ballet Theater’s “Princess Aurora” on the afternoon of Dec. 7, 1941, when she learned of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. She feared returning for the evening performance. Image Though Ms. Osato seemed an incongruous choice to play Ivy Smith, an “all-American girl,” in “On the Town,” her performance received outstanding reviews.CreditEileen Darby/The LIFE Images Collection, via Getty Images “My heritage had never been hidden,” Ms. Osato recalled in a 2009 interview. “I thought, ‘Oh, my God, people in the audience who had a child in Hawaii. What if someone throws something at me? What’s going to happen if they hiss at me?’ ” The ballet’s management and her boyfriend and future husband, Victor Elmaleh, persuaded her to go on again that night. She danced in a daze — but, as she remembered it, “nothing did happen.” Although she was born and raised in the Midwest, Ms. Osato seemed an incongruous choice to play Ivy Smith, billed as the “all-American girl,” in “On the Town.” Her father, Shoji, was a native of Japan, and her mother, Frances, was of French-Irish background. But Ms. Osato received outstanding reviews when the show, the first Broadway collaboration of Jerome Robbins and Leonard Bernstein, opened in December 1944. She was especially gratified by the reception in light of her ethnic background. As she wrote in a memoir, “Distant Dances” (1980), “It was amazing to me that at the height of a world war fought over the vital political, moral and racial issues, a Broadway musical should feature, and have audiences unquestionably accept, a half-Japanese as an all-American girl.” Lewis Nichols, reviewing “On the Town” for The New York Times, wrote, “Miss Osato brought down the highest rafters when she appeared a year ago in ‘One Touch of Venus,’ and there is no reason to replace any of those rafters now.” He added, “Her dancing is easy and her face expressive.” Sono Osato was born on Aug. 29, 1919, in Omaha, where her father worked as a photographer. She moved with her family to Chicago and became enthralled by ballet at age 8 when her mother took her to see Serge Diaghilev’s company perform “Cléopâtre” in Monte Carlo. On returning home, Ms. Osato attended ballet classes. In 1934 she was taken on by Colonel de Basil’s company at an audition in Chicago. In November 1940 she danced with that company in Manhattan as the Siren in David Lichine’s newly choreographed version of “The Prodigal Son.” Image Ms. Osato, leaping, and other dancers performing a number from the Broadway musical “One Touch of Venus” as the show’s choreographer, Agnes de Mille, watched in the background.CreditGjon Mili/The LIFE Picture Collection, via Getty Images “Her exotic beauty and her grasp of the mood and manner of the choreographer make her completely and delightfully right,” John Martin wrote in The Times. Ms. Osato joined the Ballet Theater soon afterward. Although she enjoyed success in New York, the military and the federal government barred her from going with the troupe on its tours to Mexico and California because of her Japanese background. She left “On the Town” in the fall of 1945 and was replaced by Allyn Ann McLerie. She made only sporadic appearances after that, having decided to devote her time to her family. In her later years, Ms. Osato, who lived in Manhattan, was a major benefactor of Career Transition for Dancers, which helps professional dancers train for new careers when their performing days end. In the fall of 2014, she attended a performance of the Broadway revival of “On the Town,” in which her role was played by Megan Fairchild. In addition to her sons, she is survived by three grandchildren. Her husband, Mr. Elmaleh, whom she married in 1943 and who became a real estate developer with many properties in New York, died in 2014. Later in life she split her time between her homes in Manhattan and in Bridgehampton, on Long Island. After the emotional turmoil of wartime, Ms. Osato was exhilarated when Germany surrendered; her father had been freed and her brother had survived the fighting in Italy. On May 8, 1945 — V-E Day — she was looking out the windows of the Martin Beck Theater, where the Navy boys of “On the Town” were still romping through New York in the precious hours before their ship headed off to war. “We saw crowds of men and women, in uniform and out, hugging, dancing and shouting,” Ms. Osato wrote in her memoir. “That day the reality outside in the streets blended gloriously with our glimpse onstage of the preciousness of our todays in the face of our unknown tomorrows. Joy and tearful relief engulfed the theater and the city.” Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.

arts Dramatic Reading: A Memoir by the Director of ‘The History Boys’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Dramatic Reading: A Memoir by the Director of ‘The History Boys’ Supported by Nonfiction Dramatic Reading: A Memoir by the Director of ‘The History Boys’ Image A scene from Nicholas Hytner’s production of “One Man, Two Guvnors,” with James Corden, center.CreditCreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times By Alex Witchel Dec. 1, 2017 BALANCING ACTS Behind the Scenes at London’s National Theatre By Nicholas Hytner 312 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95 In his new memoir, Nicholas Hytner, the former artistic director of the National Theater in London, recalls the organization’s 50th-anniversary celebration in 2013. Included in an evening of highlights was Alan Bennett’s hit play “The History Boys,” which Hytner had directed there to great acclaim. Richard Griffiths, the gifted actor who played a teacher to those boys, died earlier that year, so Bennett played the role instead. “He didn’t efface memories of Richard,” Hytner writes, “but he landed an enormous laugh that Richard never got, because 10 years previously, neither Richard nor I had understood the line properly.” “It used to drive me mad,” Bennett observed. “Why on earth didn’t you tell me?” Hytner responded. For the pre-existing condition of British opacity, there really is no cure. It is this issue of engagement, and its absence, that bedevils too many stretches of “Balancing Acts: Behind the Scenes at London’s National Theatre.” Hytner held his post there for 12 years (2003 to 2015), producing up to 20 plays annually, directing 26 himself. Let’s be clear: Hytner is indisputably one of the best theater directors in the world. He read English at Cambridge, and his approach to Shakespeare and the classics is compelling and nuanced (his 2010 “Hamlet” at the National with Rory Kinnear was an emotionally riveting high in a lifetime of watching that play). His grasp of low comedy is equally impressive — with the playwright Richard Bean, Hytner reconceptualized Goldoni’s 1746 comedy, “The Servant of Two Masters,” as “One Man, Two Guvnors,” a star vehicle for a dazzling James Corden set in 1960s Brighton, incorporating slapstick, farce and a skiffle band. He’s no slouch either when it comes to musicals; his 1991 revival of “Carousel” at the National moved to Lincoln Center Theater, where he won a Tony for best direction and the show won for best musical revival. And his 1989 production of “Miss Saigon” ran for a decade, both in the West End and on Broadway. At the National’s three stages, at least half the plays Hytner produced each season were new plays. These included commissions on topical issues like politics and the media, since he had decided the National “should examine the constituent parts of its title, and explore both the state of the nation and the boundaries of the theater.” He revitalized his audience by persuading Travelex to sponsor a £10 ticket; more than 30 percent of that audience had never gone to the National before. Image Hytner was knighted for his service to drama in 2010, no small accomplishment for a gay, Jewish boy from Didsbury, a middle-class suburb of Manchester. It’s the writing about it that seems to give him pause. After a lively introduction, he falls into a dutiful slog of sausage making, devoting long sections to plot summaries and production details that are dead on arrival. A master showman making the mistake of telling rather than showing should have been avoidable — is there an editor in the house? — along with passages like this: “No playwright insists more eloquently that the arts should not be the exclusive property of a privileged elite than Lee Hall, so when ‘The Pitmen Painters’ opened at Live Theater, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 2008, I hurried up to see it.” Once Hytner focuses on his relationship with Bennett, we move to higher, more solid ground, though there are still lapses, most in the name of Shakespeare. But don’t blame him, let’s look at the real point: Hytner abdicates his responsibilities as a reporter whenever the news is less than laudatory. He is a genius at taking himself down but is loath to cast that gimlet eye elsewhere. Early in his tenure, he produces “His Girl Friday,” with Jack O’Brien directing. In the cast was Margaret Tyzack, “a legend of the London stage,” he recounts. “‘I love Jack O’Brien,’ she said. ‘No nonsense. He tells you where to stand, when to move, where the laughs are. It’s such a relief. I haven’t worked with a director like him for decades.’ She seemed so happy that I thought I wouldn’t remind her how recently she’d worked with me.” Gold. But then we get: “Omertà prevents me from naming the guilty directors of some fine plays that barely survived their ministrations.” Really? I wondered if he misunderstood the assignment, but of course he’s smarter than that. The publication of this memoir coincides with the opening of the Bridge Theater, Hytner’s next act, a for-profit mini-version of the National where he will run the place and actually get paid for it without having to raise public tuppence. He has programmed a new season jammed with name talent that kicked off last month with him directing Rory Kinnear in “Young Marx,” a new play by Richard Bean. So all comment is considered here, since going forward, everyone remains a chess piece. The good news is that in its last third, “Balancing Acts” loses some balance when Hytner locates his narrative nerve. After producing blockbuster hits like “The History Boys,” “War Horse” and “One Man, Two Guvnors,” he learns how to monetize his nonprofit enterprise much as Joe Papp, the artistic director of the Public Theater, did with “A Chorus Line” in the 1970s. Hytner starts telling stories, writing fully realized scenes that are funny and immediate and ring true. Among them is an account of Danny Boyle directing “Frankenstein,” each day welcoming Hytner’s insistent notes while executing none of them. And Hytner delivers a priceless rendition of his own hysterical outburst as the opening of “One Man, Two Guvnors” looms. During a run-through, as the understudies laugh eagerly at every last bit, he yells: “Stop laughing! Nobody’s allowed to laugh anymore! I’m the arbiter of funny! I get to decide!” Where was this delectable creature 200 pages ago? Finally, he engages. Throughout the book, Hytner takes pains, periodically, to explain his natural reticence. Posner, a character in “The History Boys,” speaks to him, he writes. Posner is described by his teacher this way: “A sense of not sharing, of being out of it. … A holding back. Not being in the swim.” Hytner adds, “And no matter how gregarious my job, this always cuts me to the quick.” Of “Carousel” he writes: “I’ve never heard such unrestrained sobbing in a theater. … A thousand people every night told me I wasn’t alone in devoting too much of my life to emotional self-defense.” That is the comfort and community of the theater, certainly, but theater is not separate from life. You can’t see it or make it — or write about it — in a vacuum. No one is more protected in the wings than in a spotlight, however it looks. The triumphant curtain call to a standing ovation and vomiting with fright in your dressing room are two parts of a whole. Hytner writes of his friendship with the director Sam Mendes: “We often take in a show together like a couple of old matinee ladies, then gossip over dinner about who’s up and who’s down in the London theater.” That sounds delightful. Next time you convene, book a larger table. And take us with you. Alex Witchel writes for The Washington Post and Vanity Fair. Her most recent book is “All Gone: A Memoir of My Mother’s Dementia. With Refreshments.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page 19 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Dramatic Reading.

Glenn Close won a Golden Globe on Sunday and it was one of the biggest upsets of the night. Her portrayal of Joan Castleman in “The Wife” won her a third Globe for best actress in a drama, over Lady Gaga, who was widely expected to win for her performance in “A Star is Born.” In a tearful speech that drew many in the crowd to their feet, Close, seemingly caught off-guard when her name was announced, implored women to “find personal fulfillment.” After acknowledging the other nominees and thanking, among others, “Meg Wolitzer for writing this incredible novel and Jane Anderson for adapting it,” the actress said it took 14 years to make the movie. “You know, it was called ‘The Wife.’ I think that’s why it took 14 years to get made.” She continued: “To play a character is so internal. And I’m thinking of my mom who really sublimated herself to my father her whole life and in her 80s she said to me, “I feel I haven’t accomplished anything.” And it was so not right and I feel what I’ve learned through this whole experience is that, you know, women, we are nurturers, that’s what’s expected of us. We have our children. We have our husbands if we are lucky enough, and our partners, whoever. But we have to find personal fulfillment. We have to follow our dreams. We have to say, “I can do that and I should be allowed to do that.” And, you know, when I was little, I felt like Muhammad Ali, who was destined to be a boxer. I felt destined to be an actress. I saw all the early Disney films and Hayley Mills, and I said, “I can do that.” And here I am today. It will have been 45 years in September that I am a working actress. And I cannot imagine a more wonderful life. Thank you Björn Runge, who is here, who directed “The Wife,” who trusted the close-up, who knew where to put the camera and how to light us. Jonathan Pryce, what a great partner. My daughter Annie who played the foundation of this character. I love you, my darling. Thank you so much.” Here’s the full list of winners.

arts Broadway Actors Pushing for Profit-Sharing in Creation of Shows - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|Broadway Actors Pushing for Profit-Sharing in Creation of Shows Supported by Broadway Actors Pushing for Profit-Sharing in Creation of Shows Image Jarrod Spector and Micaela Diamond in “The Cher Show,” a Broadway production developed through so-called “labs” that are now the subject of a labor dispute.CreditCreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times By Michael Paulson Jan. 6, 2019 Broadway performers and stage managers are demanding a share of the profits from hit shows they help to create, setting off a labor dispute that is threatening to disrupt the high-stakes development of new musicals and plays. Actors’ Equity, a national labor union, and the Broadway League, a trade association representing producers, are at odds over the issue two years after public pressure from the original cast of “Hamilton” prompted that blockbuster show’s producers to agree to a new formula for distributing its proceeds. Equity says the two sides are at an impasse and it is considering a limited strike in which it would bar its members from participating in any developmental work with commercial producers. The union says it is unhappy with how its members are compensated for work in developmental labs, which are generally four-week sessions in which actors and writers test out material for shows in progress. Recent productions that have used labs include “The Cher Show,” “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Hello, Dolly!” and “Waitress.” “After two years of wrangling and negotiating we are just at a standstill,” Mary McColl, the union’s executive director, said. The Broadway League says there is no impasse; that the two sides are still talking and that producers still hope a deal can be reached. “Negotiations have been going on for some time, with lots of back and forth, and we have additional proposals we’re trying to make,” the League’s president, Charlotte St. Martin, said. “We believe there will be a deal that will be beneficial for both sides.” The dispute is intensifying at a time when Broadway is booming. Although most shows still fail, those that succeed can make hundreds of millions and, in a few cases, billions of dollars. The current tension comes just months before a broader negotiation over the general contract for Broadway performers and stage managers. Image Eden Espinosa in the Williamstown Theater Festival production of “Lempicka,” a new musical that recently held a followup developmental lab in New York.CreditDaniel Rader Equity estimates that about a quarter of Broadway’s new shows in recent years have employed developmental labs to work on scripts, songs and dances. According to the union, the amount of work done in labs has doubled over the last five seasons. There have been 75 labs since 2016, and about half of those have led to full productions. In recent weeks “Lempicka” and “Jagged Little Pill” — new musicals that are retooling for Broadway after initial productions in Massachusetts — have held such sessions. And coming up are labs for stage adaptations of the films “Almost Famous” and “August Rush,” as well as for an untitled Michael Jackson jukebox musical and “Heart of Rock & Roll,” which uses the Huey Lewis songbook. Labs began about a decade ago in an effort to keep more developmental work in New York, which can be more convenient for actors who live in the region but also helps to showcase the material. Some labs end with run-throughs of one or two acts, to which potential investors and theater owners are invited as they consider whether to get involved. To replace an agreement that has now lapsed, Equity is asking that the next version include not only a pay raise (currently lab participants are paid about $1,000 a week) but also a provision requiring that 1 percent of any profit after a show recoups its capitalization costs be shared with lab participants, since they helped to create the show’s success. For the last several months, the union has been making its case via social media, with some of its best-known members expressing public support for the campaign. Stephen Bogardus, an actor who serves as chairman of the union’s show development subcommittee, said the landscape had changed, and that pay should change with it. “Everybody wants to be in at the ground floor — to create and put their stamp on something,’’ he said. “We are collaborators, and we need to be acknowledged for what we’re doing. We’re putting in more skin than we once did, and after recoupment we think it’s fair that we should be able to share in the success of the show.” The League has thus far argued that individual producers should voluntarily decide whether to share profits with lab participants. Some big players already have, including Disney, for “Frozen”; and Lorne Michaels, for “Mean Girls.” Kate Shindle, the union president, said the amount of money at stake is “pretty modest.” Under the union’s proposal, for every $1 million in profit made by a show, $10,000 would be set aside to be shared by the actors and stage managers who participated in the developmental labs.

arts New Year’s Sounds: The Week in Classical Music - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Music|New Year’s Sounds: The Week in Classical Music Supported by that decisive moment New Year’s Sounds: The Week in Classical Music Jan. 4, 2019 Image Piotr Beczala and Anna Netrebko in “Adriana Lecouvreur” at the Metropolitan Opera.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times [Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Happy new year! The Metropolitan Opera rang in 2019 with a boffo “Adriana Lecouvreur,” featuring a love triangle of Anna Netrebko, Anita Rachvelishvili and Piotr Beczala with enough sizzle to lead some critics to warm to the not-always-respected work. More on that in a second. I was more than 4,000 miles away, celebrating in Vienna with a life-affirming 26-hour musical marathon: Strauss’s ‘’Die Fledermaus” at the State Opera on New Year’s Eve; more Strauss the next morning at the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Concert in the Musikverein; and the Vienna Symphony playing Beethoven’s Ninth that evening. Is there a more musical city? In the New York of my childhood, aggressive street hawkers offered drugs to passers-by. In Vienna they sound almost as furtive, but their pitch is: “Concert? Opera? Strauss? Mozart?” Here are some postcards. MICHAEL COOPER The New Year’s Concert I’ve often wondered: Do the star conductors the Vienna Philharmonic brings in each year for its New Year’s concerts actually conduct, given that this music is practically this orchestra’s birthright? When I entered the mostly empty, majestically gilded Musikverein to watch the players rehearse with Christian Thielemann, the principal conductor of the Dresden Staatskapelle and music director of the Bayreuth Festival, I got an inkling. As he took to the podium, the shimmering strings announced that he was beginning the rehearsal at the end, with the traditional encore: Strauss’s “Blue Danube” Waltz. It is perhaps the most famous waltz there is, and one the orchestra could probably play in its sleep. But Mr. Thielmann was not one to let the players set the coordinates to 3/4 time and go on cruise control. He stopped them quite a bit, at one point asking the cellos to shape one of its most familiar phrases differently, and he continued fine-tuning the piece until he was happy. “It is wonderful to work with a strong partner,” Mr. Thielmann said in an interview, saying that he prefers orchestras like the Vienna Philharmonic, with strong points of view, to those that treat scores as blank slates to be filled in by conductors. “The weak partners are difficult.” The New Year’s concert must be the world’s most widely seen regularly held classical music event: It is televised in 91 nations, and before the month is out, Sony plans to release it on CD, DVD and Blu-ray. This year there were 14 cameras in the hall; some of the cameramen hid behind the copious floral arrangements, like hunters in a duck blind. A “Fledermaus” Without Second-Guessing It is not easy to bring off “Die Fledermaus” these days. Should it be updated? Translated? Made “relevant”? Can it be performed with a suitably Viennese sensibility? Without such second-guessing, the Vienna State Opera’s unapologetically old-fashioned Otto Schenk production, with opulent sets by Günther Schneider-Siemssen, still holds the stage on New Year’s Eve, as it has for years. (Mahler conducted the work when he led the company.) There were a few flash moments — the bass René Pape was the special guest in the second act, singing “Some Enchanted Evening” at Prince Orlofsky’s ball — but the evening’s chief pleasure was getting to see a production that took the work neither too seriously nor too lightly. The waltzes lilted, the patter went by quickly enough, and the cast amused — especially Adrian Eröd, who brought humorous, easy physicality to the role of the duped Eisenstein, and Annette Dasch, who brought operatic glamour as his wife, Rosalinde. And walking out of the opera house in time for an al fresco mug of hot mulled wine, followed by a cold glass of champagne, on Kärntner Strasse, as fireworks exploded overhead at midnight, made the evening difficult to replicate. An “Ode to Joy” for the New Year For more than four decades, the Vienna Symphony has marked the changing of the year with Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9. While the Philharmonic’s morning concert was in the gilded Musikverein — where golden, topless caryatids seem to hold up the balconies and the richly coffered ceiling is even more dazzling than the crystal chandeliers — the Symphony’s evening concert was in the stately Konzerthaus, with its Secessionist and Art Nouveau touches. Something about seeing the physical differences of the two halls — the Musikverein opened in 1870, the Konzerthaus in 1913 — brought home just how long Emperor Franz Joseph, who was in power for both openings, reigned. They evoke different eras. Andrés Orozco-Estrada, who will succeed Philippe Jordan as the orchestra’s music director in 2021, conducted, and managed to bring out the true strangeness of the Ninth. Under his baton Beethoven’s stops and starts and changes of direction still startled. The stars of the Met’s new production of “Adriana Lecouvreur” could not be better: the ravishing soprano Anna Netrebko in the title role, the smoldering mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili as the Princess of Bouillon, and the clarion tenor Piotr Beczala as Maurizio, the dashing count both women love. It’s easy to overlook several excellent singers in supporting roles, especially the baritone Ambrogio Maestri as Michonnet, the gruff stage manager of the Parisian theater company where Adriana is a headliner. With his beefy voice and Falstaffian physique, Mr. Maestri often sounds like a kind of basso. And Falstaff, his signature role, which he has sung to acclaim at the Met, has also been the province of some major bass-baritones and basses. Still, Mr. Ambrogio is a genuine baritone, albeit with an exceptionally deep and booming voice, who has excelled as Puccini’s Scarpia and, as this excerpt from an “Aida” in Florence some years ago makes clear, Verdi’s Amonasro. Here, joining Hui He in the intense Act III duet, Mr. Ambrogio brings a winning blend of Italianate lyricism and robust power to his singing.

By Reihan Salam Jan. 4, 2019 THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM Facing the New Anxieties By Paul Collier 248 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $29.99. You might expect that Paul Collier, a noted development economist at Oxford who has devoted most of his professional life to the uplift of the global poor, would see himself as a “citizen of the world.” But that’s not quite right. Collier grew up in Sheffield, a once-flourishing English steel town that provided working-class families like his own with a modicum of prosperity and stability, and that has since struggled in the face of import competition and the loss of many of its most ambitious citizens to London and other dynamic cities. He attributes his prodigious accomplishments in no small part to the cooperative character of the community, and the nation, in which he was raised. National loyalty, far from being inimical to a more just and decent world in which all, including the world’s poorest, can flourish, is seen by Collier as a firmer foundation for global cooperation than abstract cosmopolitanism, which all too often serves as a mask for unenlightened self-interest. The question animating his small but wide-ranging book “The Future of Capitalism” is whether the sense of rootedness that so defined the Britain of his youth can be restored. Image Postwar Britain was, in Collier’s affectionate account, a society undergirded by a dense web of reciprocal obligations, which in turn gave rise to a strong sense of shared identity. A widespread belief that the fates of the cities and the provinces were tied together, and that the affluent and established had a stake in cultivating the talents of young strivers like himself, justified large increases in public investment. It also infused the sensibilities of many corporate executives, who tempered the pursuit of short-term profit with a concern for the long-term prosperity of the communities they served. But more recently, Collier argues, these reciprocal obligations unraveled as class divides, separating the educated from the less educated, and regional divides, separating dense metropolitan areas that attracted a critical mass of educated professionals from smaller cities and towns that did not, have strained national loyalties. Liberated from the moral constraints of earlier generations, Collier says, families have grown more fragmented, employers have embraced a more short-term outlook and the metropolitan rich have come to look upon their less well-off fellow-nationals with disdain. At the same time, the centrist social democratic ideal of Collier’s youth, rooted in the habits of civic cooperation and mutual aid, gave way, on the one hand, to the arid utilitarianism of economists and, on the other, to the rights-oriented liberalism of lawyers who encouraged people to understand themselves as victims seeking redress rather than as citizens seeking solidarity. Today, confidence in the competence of the economists and the righteousness of the lawyers has waned. As a result, the rich democracies find themselves lurching between extremes of left and right, vulnerable to charismatic populists offering the false promise of a return to an unrecoverable past. How does Collier intend to repair the bonds of affection in the rich democracies? “The Future of Capitalism” is rife with inventive proposals, including the creation of a new international body that would coordinate the diplomatic efforts of the world’s great powers; reforming corporate boards; establishing socioeconomically integrated schools built around distinctive “belief systems” and much else. The most controversial of Collier’s prescriptions will, given his likely audience, undoubtedly be those measures aimed at curbing the economic advantages flowing to the people he describes as the “smug skilled.” To address the gulf separating the Londons and the Sheffields of the world, he proposes taxing educated metropolitan professionals more steeply than their equally well-educated provincial counterparts, a policy he justifies by pointing to the fact that the former earn more simply by dint of living in proximity to others like them, not by dint of superior skill. Though I wouldn’t endorse Collier’s manifesto in every detail, his “hard centrism” has much to offer. Reihan Salam is the executive editor of National Review.

I was born in India, grew up in Hong Kong and have learned to call both London and New York home. So it is difficult for me to find books in which I can share experiences and giggle with the characters. Then I found Zadie Smith’s WHITE TEETH. The book revolves around two families in London — the Iqbals, an immigrant couple from Bangladesh who have twin sons; and the Joneses, an Englishman married to a Jamaican woman, who have a daughter together. Through these characters, Smith takes a granular look at the first- and second-generation immigrant experience; the duality of wanting to both preserve one’s roots and cut them off to fit in, ‘the feeling of belonging nowhere that comes to people who belong everywhere,’ and the crushing burden of stereotypes thrust upon us. Her book, published almost two decades ago, finds renewed relevance in a world of heightened nationalism. ‘It makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist,’ she writes, presciently. ‘Scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation, when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears — dissolution, disappearance.’” — Alisha Haridasani Gupta, morning briefing writer Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

By Melanie Finn Jan. 4, 2019 NORTH OF DAWN By Nuruddin Farah 373 pp. Riverhead Books. $27. The comedian Hasan Minhaj has spoken about “the audacity of equality” — the belief many immigrants foster of belonging to their adopted country, and how rudely, and often, they are reprimanded for their aspirations. Mugdi and Gacalo, the Somali couple at the heart of Nuruddin Farah’s new novel, “North of Dawn,” have settled into middle age and middle-class Norway with just such audacity. In their roomy house, Mugdi putters around translating an obscure Norwegian novel, while his wife, Gacalo, works; they are solvent, secular, well-adapted members of the global Somali diaspora. The challenge to their contentment comes not from Norway’s right wing, but from their own family. Their Norwegian-raised son, Dhaqaneh, joined a terrorist cell in Oslo before fleeing to Somalia, where he killed himself in an Al Shabaab-sponsored suicide attack near Mogadishu. Mugdi, whom a friend describes as “culturally a Muslim,” is disgusted and affronted, wanting nothing to do with his son’s memory. But Gacalo insists that she keep her word to Dhaqaneh and care for his wife and stepchildren, currently living in a refugee camp in Kenya. Enter the widow, Waliya; her son, Naciim, 12; and daughter, Saafi, 14. Gacalo dispatches Mugdi to the airport to collect them. They have taken a circuitous smuggler’s route to Europe, but Mugdi and Gacalo’s sponsorship allows their entry into Norway and its generous immigrant settlement system. From this first encounter, Waliya resists both her in-laws and the wiles of their Western nation. Dressed in a “body tent” and reciting Quoranic verses in the back of Mugdi’s car, Waliya refuses to fasten her seatbelt, stating that her death is the will of Allah. Mugdi responds that he may have to pay a heavy fine to the police if she doesn’t. Her compliance is not acquiescence. The battle lines are drawn. The war between these two is, of course, a proxy for the global clash between fundamentalism and secularism. In the hands of a younger, brasher novelist, we might expect high drama, but here, instead, is a nuanced, quietly devastating family soap opera; we can almost hear the clatter of an Olivetti typewriter. The Somali-born Farah has been writing books for nearly half a century, his name aligned with Nadine Gordimer and Chinua Achebe. Like them, he uses the intimate as allegory for the national. If we cannot understand why a family falls apart, then neither can we understand why a nation does — a truth those of us weary from holiday-dinner-table political arguments may appreciate. Image There is indeed a weary tone to this book, relayed mainly through Mugdi: the exhausted, chronic grief of one who has witnessed his country implode like a dark star. “Imagine a single house collapsing and causing a handful of deaths,” Mugdi urges. “Then think of the damage that would be caused if an entire country collapsed in on itself, the way Somalia did in 1991.” Mugdi, who began his career as a diplomat for his country when it was still a country, notes: “The world could not decipher the signposts. A people with the same singular culture, the same religion and the same language tearing into one another.” Mugdi is the obvious protagonist, and Waliya the ungrateful interloper. He has alcohol in the house, his best friends are white Norwegians, his pregnant, divorced daughter works in Geneva and he proves a doting grandfather to the traumatized Naciim and Saafi. He is not even a refugee. He makes this point, as if to put himself above the shabby, desperate masses crossing the Mediterranean on plastic rafts. Meanwhile, Waliya soon has the neighbors up in arms for playing her prayer tapes too loudly. She gets involved with two extremist imams, and a morally sketchy girlfriend from the refugee camp shows up. Shrouded in her black robes, scheming to marry her teenage daughter off to one of the imams, Waliya is an enigma. How could she not want what Mugdi, Norway and the West have to offer: a nice house, a good job, laws that will prevent her from being beaten regularly by a male relative? Our bafflement is complete. Farah is a deeply sophisticated writer, his prose almost aromatic, like rich, sweet Somali tea. The story exists in the ether between the words; nothing will be simplified or explained, and quiet dread mounts, page after page, though little plot propels it. Mugdi has chosen to translate Ole Edvart Rolvaag’s “Giants in the Earth” from the original Norwegian into Somali. Rolvaag’s saga — published between 1924 and 1925 and the first in a trilogy — concerns a family of Norwegian pioneers in the Dakota Territory who struggle with Native Americans, forces of nature and their immigrant identity. But for whom is this translation intended? Mugdi never asks himself, and it feels a pusillanimous and indulgent exercise, as if the best this exiled man can now do is write about foreign people in a foreign country because his own no longer exists; it has been wiped from the map and from his bereft and sybaritic soul. Somalia is being reinvented by a new generation, and the audacious, shrouded widow Waliya walks through its ruined streets, dead certain of her place. Melanie Finn is the author, most recently, of “The Underneath.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page 8 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Globalization and Grief.

arts At Auction, Unknown Warhol Sculpture That Was Gift to Boyfriend - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|At Auction, Unknown Warhol Sculpture That Was Gift to Boyfriend Supported by At Auction, Unknown Warhol Sculpture That Was Gift to Boyfriend Image An abstract sculpture created by Andy Warhol and given to Jon Gould is part of an auction of items from the estate of his mother, Harriett Gould, in Massachusetts.CreditCredit2017 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc./Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Nick Cosentino, via John McInnis Auctioneers By Blake Gopnik Nov. 30, 2017 It was every auctioneer’s dream: Sorting through the usual clutter in the attic of an old New England home, Dan Meader came across a trove of objects far more precious and rare than expected. Tucked away among the usual ships’ chests and rush seats was a little hoard of objects by, and gifts from, the great Pop artist Andy Warhol, including what seems to be a unique and unknown late sculpture. “I started shaking — ‘I can’t believe I’m holding this!,’” was how Mr. Meader remembered the moment, when reached by phone earlier this week. The home, in Amesbury, Mass., had been owned by Mr. Meader’s old friend Harriett Gould, who died a year ago. The Warholiana hidden away in its attic had once belonged to her son Jon Gould, a Hollywood executive who was Warhol’s last boyfriend. He died in 1986 of complications from AIDS. The Warhol trove, and the ships’ chests and rush seats, will go on the block Saturday at 1 p.m. at John McInnis Auctioneers in Amesbury. Mr. Meader is the firm’s director. The Warhol objects include photographs that he took of Jon Gould and then gave to him, and other gifts including a fine Austrian coat, signed Warhol books, a boxed set of Proust (Warhol was far more literary than people know) and some antique carousel horses very like the ones Warhol collected in the 1950s. Some of these gifts, as Mr. Meader discovered, seem to be mentioned in the artist’s diaries. They reflect the passionate crush that Warhol had on Gould, who at times lived with him. The archives at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh overflow with poignant notes and valentines from the artist to Gould, along with a few from Gould to Warhol. Image A carousel horse, said to have been given to Mr. Gould by Warhol, is also part of the auction.CreditNick Cosentino/John McInnis Auctioneers Warhol, often billed as a hardhearted cynic, was actually, or also, a true romantic who almost never found the love he craved. The sculpture uncovered in the attic is not mentioned in the artist’s diaries or, apparently, anywhere else in the vast Warhol literature. It is very unusual, even by Warholian standards. It seems as though the artist simply took a blank stretched canvas, about 16 by 25 inches, and folded it diagonally until its stretcher broke. He then brushed three big dollops of acrylic paint — pale yellow, baby blue and red — over the splintered remains. If it weren’t for the object’s provenance in the Gould household, plus its prominent and seemingly authentic inscription and signature — “Jon/Andy Warhol 83” — Warhol would hardly be the first maker who came to mind. On the other hand, his output was much more varied and eccentric than people realize. It went way beyond the soup cans, Marilyns and society portraits Warhol is best known for: He once made a “sculpture” that was nothing more than a motion-alarmed space in a room; he was known to use urinating men to “paint” a new kind of abstraction. The sculpture might likewise reflect Warhol’s long and vexed relationship to the abstract: A favorite college teacher of his had been one of the pioneers of American abstraction but was switching to the figure just when Warhol studied with him. A tension between pure form and notable content informed Warhol’s entire career. It came to a head in the 1980s with a series of “abstractions” that did double duty as camouflage tarps and Rorschach blots. An “abstract” sculpture that also stands as a trashed painting doesn’t seem an impossible experiment to add to those — even if it might seem more failed than successful. Mr. Meader has given the sculpture an estimate of $500,000 to $1,000,000 — which, he admits, is more like a guesstimate, given the lack of pieces to compare it to. Like the other items in Saturday’s auction, he said, it is being sold without a minimum price: “The public will determine on that day what it’s worth.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Gift From Warhol Goes on the Block.

Known for his flamboyant style and attention-drawing eye patch, he sang lead on one of the group’s best-known songs, “The Cover of Rolling Stone.”CreditCreditGijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns, via Getty Images By Neil Genzlinger Jan. 2, 2019 Ray Sawyer, who cut a distinctive figure as a member of the band Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show thanks to his flamboyant style and attention-drawing eye patch, and who sang lead on one of the group’s best-known songs, “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” died on Monday in Daytona, Fla. He was 81. His wife, Linda Lombardi Sawyer, announced his death on Facebook. She did not give a cause but said in a post a week earlier that he had been hospitalized. Mr. Sawyer and the band rose to prominence in the early 1970s with a country-rock sound that later became more lush and occasionally even displayed a disco influence. Dennis Locorriere usually sang lead, but Mr. Sawyer was the most recognizable band member. His eye patch gave the group its name, a sort of skewing of the Captain Hook character from “Peter Pan.” “I’ve had the eye patch since I was 27,” Mr. Sawyer told The St. Petersburg Times in 2010. “I was in a car accident. Some people still ask if it is a gimmick, something to draw attention, but it’s real.” He sang the lead vocal on “Rolling Stone.” (The label of the original single gave the title as “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” though the lyrics he sings use a “the” before the magazine’s name.) The song, a parody about rock ’n’ roll fame, reached the Top 10 of the Billboard pop chart in March 1973. That same month, the magazine did in fact put the band, or at least a caricature of it, on its cover. Ray Sawyer was born on Feb. 1, 1937, in Chickasaw, Ala. Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show was formed in the late 1960s in New Jersey and caught fire after it joined with Shel Silverstein, the cartoonist and sometime songwriter, and played his songs in the 1971 movie “Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?” (directed by Ulu Grosbard and starring Dustin Hoffman). The movie got the band a contract with Columbia Records. Mr. Silverstein, who died in 1999, wrote “Sylvia’s Mother,” a lament about a pay-phone call that in 1972 became the group’s first big hit. It may or may not have been a parody of country ballads, but “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” also written by Mr. Silverstein, was certainly a gag. “We take all kinds of pills that give us all kind of thrills,” the lyrics went, “but the thrill we’ve never known is the thrill that’ll gitcha when you get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone.” By the mid-1970s the band had been derailed by mismanagement and was facing bankruptcy. “Somebody was putting the cash away, and it wasn’t us,” Mr. Sawyer told The Toronto Star in 1991. “The bankruptcy court took everything away from us, even the ‘Medicine Show’ part of our name. I haven’t figured out yet why they did that. It’s like taking the Pips out of Gladys Knight and the Pips.” But by 1976 the band, as simply Dr. Hook, was on the comeback trail with a smoother sound, heard that year on a cover of Sam Cooke’s “Only Sixteen.” Later hits included “When You’re in Love With a Beautiful Woman” in 1979. Mr. Sawyer left the group in 1982, and he and Mr. Locorriere later engaged in a legal tussle over rights to the group’s name. Mr. Sawyer continued to perform into this decade. A full list of survivors was not immediately available.

Forni, the director of the Civility Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, in his office in Baltimore in 2007. “Acts of violence are often the result of an exchange of acts of rudeness that spiral out of control,” he said.CreditCreditAndy Nelson/The Christian Science Monitor By Neil Genzlinger Dec. 7, 2018 P. M. Forni, a professor of early Italian literature who became a leading exponent of civility in our own discourteous times, died on Dec. 1 in Towson, Md. He was 67. His wife, Virginia H. Forni, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease. Dr. Forni was a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore when, in 1997, he became the principal founder of the Johns Hopkins Civility Project, which not only examined the importance of civility in human society but also encouraged the practice of it on campuses and in communities through campaigns with bumper stickers, buttons and speaking programs. Dr. Forni, who directed the project (now known as the Civility Initiative) for many years, also wrote two books on the topic, “Choosing Civility: The Twenty-Five Rules of Considerate Conduct,” published in 2002, and “The Civility Solution: What to Do When People Are Rude” (2010). “The first book is how not to be rude,” Virginia Forni explained in a telephone interview, “and the second book is what to do when other people are rude to you.” The 25 rules he set out in “Choosing Civility” were not particularly surprising; they included “Speak Kindly” and “Keep It Down (and Rediscover Silence).” But they resonated. The book, which has been translated into German and Italian, is still frequently cited in articles and speeches, as is its follow-up. Civility, to Dr. Forni, was not just a matter of learning and observing rules of good manners. It was something with very real consequences. Civility means less stress, which has advantages like improved health, safer driving and more productivity at work. Lack of civility too is more than a matter of semantics, he argued. “Acts of violence are often the result of an exchange of acts of rudeness that spiral out of control,” he told The Christian Science Monitor in 2007. “Disrespect can lead to bloodshed. By keeping the levels of incivility down we keep the levels of violence down.” But Dr. Forni didn’t necessarily have a sky-is-falling view of the current state of human interactions. The word “civility,” he noted in “Choosing Civility,” “derives from the Latin civitas, which means ‘city,’ especially in the sense of civic community.” Thus, said Daniel L. Buccino, who now directs the Civility Initiative, Dr. Forni considered the subject from the long view. Dr. Forni would remind people that “we have been struggling with these issues for 2,000 years,” Mr. Buccino said by email. “He would also remind us that while there is much civility work still to be done, it was important to note how much progress we have made over the centuries.” Pier Massimo Forni was born on Oct. 16, 1951, in Bologna, Italy. His father, Adriano, was a veterinarian, and his mother, Sheba (Lolli) Forni, was a homemaker. Image In this 2002 book, Dr. Forni outlined 25 rules “of considerate conduct,” including “Speak Kindly” and “Keep It Down (and Rediscover Silence).” They were not surprising, but they resonated. Dr. Forni grew up in Treviso, Italy. After graduating in 1974 from the University of Pavia, he served for two years in the Italian army’s Alpini corps, which specializes in alpine warfare. He received a Ph.D. in Italian literature at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1981 and joined the Johns Hopkins faculty in 1985. Dr. Forni taught courses on Dante, Giovanni Boccaccio and other writers and thinkers from Italy’s past. His area of scholarship eventually led to his second field of expertise. “It started with his interest in early Italian books of manners and courtesy,” Virginia Forni said. “He would teach classes on that, and it sort of grew out of that.” In “Choosing Civility,” Dr. Forni recalled the revelatory moment. “One day, while lecturing on the Divine Comedy, I looked at my students and realized that I wanted them to be kind human beings more than I wanted them to know about Dante,” he wrote. “I told them that if they knew everything about Dante and then they went out and treated an elderly lady on the bus unkindly, I’d feel that I had failed as a teacher.” He set up the Civility Project with help from Giulia Sissa, a fellow professor now at U.C.L.A., and others, and in 1998 he and Professor Sissa organized an ambitious conference called “Reassessing Civility: Forms and Values at the End of the Century.” There has occasionally been a backlash to the civility campaigns; some have seen them as a means of repressing criticism and muzzling the disenfranchised. “I had to throw the book across the room,” one resident of Howard County, Md., said of “Choosing Civility” during an initiative there in 2008. Critics notwithstanding, Dr. Forni became a go-to commentator when matters of civility made the news. He was quoted in news articles when the shock jock Don Imus was fired by CBS in 2007, when cyberhaters were piling on the actress Anne Hathaway in 2013, when electoral campaigns or holiday shoppers turned nasty. Dr. Forni and Virginia H. Drake married in 2000; she survives him. In addition to the civility books, Dr. Forni wrote “The Thinking Life: How to Thrive in the Age of Distraction” (2011), a meditation on the role of thought in the modern age. “Every day,” he wrote, “we spend most of our time doing things that our parents and grandparents not only did not do, but also could not even have imagined. Unfortunately, deep thinking is often the illustrious casualty in the digital revolution.” To be obsessed with the ephemera of modern culture, he argued, is to miss the best possibilities available to us. “If we agree that life is important, then thinking as we go through it is the basic tribute we owe it,” he concluded. “It also happens to be the golden way to the good life — the kind of life in which happiness blooms.” Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more Reader Center Wirecutter The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more Reader Center Wirecutter The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword Cooking email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2018 The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions
arts Does It Pay to Be a Writer? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|Does It Pay to Be a Writer? Supported by Books News Does It Pay to Be a Writer? Image The decline in earnings are largely because of Amazon’s lion’s share of the self-publishing, e-book and resale market.CreditCreditRuth Fremson/The New York Times By Concepción de León Jan. 5, 2019 Writing has never been a lucrative career choice, but a recent study by the Authors Guild, a professional organization for book writers, shows that it may not even be a livable one anymore. According to the survey results, the median pay for full-time writers was $20,300 in 2017, and that number decreased to $6,080 when part-time writers were considered. The latter figure reflects a 42 percent drop since 2009, when the median was $10,500. These findings are the result of an expansive 2018 study of more than 5,000 published book authors, across genres and including both traditional and self-published writers. “In the 20th century, a good literary writer could earn a middle-class living just writing,” said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of the Authors Guild, citing William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Cheever. Now, most writers need to supplement their income with speaking engagements or teaching. Strictly book-related income — which is to say royalties and advances — are also down, almost 30 percent for full-time writers since 2009. Writing for magazines and newspapers was once a solid source of additional income for professional writers, but the decline in freelance journalism and pay has meant less opportunity for authors to write for pay. Many print publications, which offered the highest rate, have been shuttered altogether. The decline in earnings is also largely because of Amazon’s lion’s share of the self-publishing, e-book and resale market, Ms. Rasenberger said. The conglomerate charges commission and marketing fees to publishers that Ms. Rasenberger said essentially prevent their books from being buried on the site. Small and independent publishers, which have fewer resources and bargaining power, have been particularly hard hit. Book publishing companies are passing these losses along to writers in the form of lower royalties and advances, and authors also lose out on income from books resold on the platform. In some ways, these changes are in line with a general shift toward a gig economy or “hustling,” in which people juggle an assortment of jobs to make up for the lack of a stable income. But the writing industry as a whole has always eluded standardization in pay. In a conversation with Manjula Martin in the book “Scratch: Writers, Money, and the Art of Making a Living,” edited by Ms. Martin, Cheryl Strayed said, “There’s no other job in the world where you get your master’s degree in that field and you’re like, ‘Well, I might make zero or I might make $5 million!’” In a recent call, Ms. Martin said that “the people who are able to practice the trade of authoring are people who have other sources of income,” adding that this creates barriers of entry and limits the types of stories that reach a wide audience. There is also, she added, a devaluation of writing in which it is often viewed as a hobby as opposed to a valuable vocation. “Everyone thinks they can write, because everybody writes,” Ms. Rasenberger said, referring to the proliferation of casual texting, emailing and tweeting. But she distinguishes these from professional writers “who have been working on their craft and art of writing for years.” “What a professional writer can convey in written word is far superior to what the rest of us can do,” Ms. Rasenberger said. “As a society we need that, because it’s a way to crystallize ideas, make us see things in a new way and create understanding of who we are as a people, where we are today and where we’re going.” Follow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter (@nytimesbooks), sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

Mr. Staley, who helped found Roulette 40 years ago, remains its director.CreditCreditJoe Carrotta for The New York Times By Seth Colter Walls Jan. 4, 2019 If you’re the kind of New Yorker prone to wondering what it would have been like to go to a CBGB that wasn’t located inside the Newark airport, you might also wonder if you arrived in the city too late. Fair enough. But the old bohemian, culturally rich downtown Manhattan spirit still has a few embers burning through the city. And at least one of these, Roulette, is actually more powerful now than at the time of its birth in 1978. Forty years after opening, Roulette is now nestled inside a YWCA complex at the corner of Third and Atlantic avenues in another downtown: Brooklyn’s. Instead of the 74 seats its co-founder — and current director — Jim Staley provided when he first organized concerts in his Tribeca loft, Roulette now has a theater that can accommodate 400. It’s not only the widest ranging music presenter in the city, but also the most comfortable and welcoming. “As long as it’s something that’s of a creative and experimental nature, they’re interested in it,” Henry Threadgill, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and saxophonist, said in an interview. “They’ve always been interested in it.” Image Mr. Staley works the mixing board inside the recording studio at Roulette.CreditJoe Carrotta for The New York Times A potent trombonist as well as an administrator, Mr. Staley is modest in describing the roots of one of New York’s most important avant-garde music spaces. “It started out as a collective,” he said in an interview at Roulette. “And then I sort of initiated a series.” That first regular series in Manhattan, which began in 1980, took place in Mr. Staley’s place on West Broadway. “We were just trying this out,” he recalled. “All these people came, and watched John Cage and Merce Cunningham come through the door, pay their five bucks.” It didn’t take long for noted composers, like the Fluxus artist Philip Corner, to start pitching concerts to him. When the neighborhood changed, Mr. Staley started looking for another home in Lower Manhattan. Late in the 2000s, Roulette leased a spot on Greene Street, until the financial crash sent the building owner’s assets into chaos. In 2011, it came to Brooklyn, where it is host to a jovial mixture of styles. In recent seasons, Roulette has presented work by a trio including YoshimiO, the sometime drummer of the avant-rock group Boredoms; a sterling evening of two-piano works by Philip Glass; and a semi-staged presentation of a four-act opera by the composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton. It is also the rental hall of choice for some of the city’s most vital music programmers, like the avant-jazz Vision Festival and Thomas Buckner’s Interpretations series. Image Anthony Davis, the composer and pianist, at Roulette.CreditJoe Carrotta for The New York Times At a recent Interpretations concert, the composer and pianist Anthony Davis, author of grand operas like “X — The Life and Times of Malcolm X” and “Amistad,” announced he would perform some material from his next opera, “The Central Park Five,” set to premiere at Long Beach Opera in June. Mr. Davis’s operatic writing was once performed at Lincoln Center by New York City Opera; now, if you want to hear this work in the city, you’ll likely end up at Roulette. Even if you can’t make it in person, you can tune in online; clips of select recent shows run on Roulette TV, while vintage audio recordings have been popping up on the venue’s SoundCloud page. Excerpts from performances by María Grand, Jennifer Choi and Amirtha Kidambi are particularly good on Roulette TV, and the SoundCloud page offers work by the likes of Leroy Jenkins and Pauline Oliveros. A launch party for an even more in-depth archive is scheduled for Feb. 12. The organization also supports up-and-coming artists with residencies and commissions. In the months before the pianist and composer Kelly Moran made her debut on the Warp label, with the album “Ultraviolet,” you could hear her working out the balance of live pianism and electronics at Roulette, thanks to one of its emerging artist grants. Describing the award as “way more monetary support than I’m used to,” Ms. Moran said in an interview that she was “shellshocked” to receive it: “It was kind of a surreal moment, because I had all these ideas for projects I wanted to do related to my record, and now I had the means to do them.” Roulette is generous to audiences, too. To my mind, its balcony remains far and away the city’s loveliest, most relaxing location from which to take in music. I knew Mr. Threadgill liked it, too, based simply on the number of times I have spotted him there. “It’s just so comfortable,” he said during our interview. “I got addicted to sitting upstairs.” Strangers tend to talk to each other during intermission, more than at other spaces devoted to experimental music. Artists often circulate before and after performances. And that beer you bought in the lobby? You can bring it into the hall. “It’s always been the nature of these kind of places that allowed for that,” Mr. Staley said, when I asked how Roulette fostered that welcoming spirit. But once again, he sounded a little too modest. Certainly plenty of spaces pay lip service to the idea of openness, but wind up feeling cliquish. Image To a critic’s mind, Roulette’s balcony remains far and away the city’s loveliest, most relaxing location from which to take in music.CreditJoe Carrotta for The New York Times “Some of the places I know, there’s a feeling of: When the thing’s over, get out,” Mr. Staley finally allowed. After a short beat, he added: “It’s not necessarily the vibe here.” Roulette itself isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. In 2010, it signed a 20-year lease with the YWCA, with a 10-year extension option. The spring 2019 calendar includes a vocal ensemble performing works by Mr. Braxton, music by the composer Erin Gee, and a night of duets by the pianists Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn. Prices are affordable: just slightly higher than the average New York movie ticket. (A subscription also knocks $5 off the price of most concerts.) If this range of offerings can’t entice you to check out one of the city’s most inviting experimental spaces — well, you can’t blame that on gentrification over in Manhattan.

arts Ming Peiffer: Why Her ‘Usual Girls’ Audiences Got So Personal - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|Ming Peiffer: Why Her ‘Usual Girls’ Audiences Got So Personal Supported by Exit Interview Ming Peiffer: Why Her ‘Usual Girls’ Audiences Got So Personal Image Ming Peiffer, outside the theater where her provocative play “Usual Girls” just finished its sold-out run.CreditCreditMichael Kirby Smith for The New York Times By Elizabeth A. Harris Dec. 24, 2018 In the words of its playwright, Ming Peiffer, “Usual Girls” is a show about “the joys and horrors of growing up being a woman — the extreme joys and the extreme horrors.” And the play, which had its final performance on Sunday, is almost perfectly tailored for this moment. It follows a half-Korean, half-white girl in 1980s Ohio into adulthood, frankly tackling issues of race, sexuality and rape along the way. Ms. Peiffer said that the show went into rehearsals just as Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the culmination of a year of #MeToo allegations. Playing in Roundabout Theater Company’s 62-seat underground space, it earned a New York Times Critic’s Pick, and the sold-out run was extended twice. That is a charmed reception for a young writer getting her first professional production. In an interview on the cusp of the final performance, Ms. Peiffer, 30, reflected on the ride. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How often did you end up seeing the show? I watched it all through previews — I was making many changes — so I saw it for about a month straight. Which is a lot. It’s a very, very personal story, and a very triggering story, so it was a lot to see that. I’ve pretty much come back every week since — if I can get a seat to my own show! It’s a good problem to have. This is not a play that tries to make the audience comfortable. Could you feel that in the theater? Oh, yes. Because of the humor, I think the whole experience is of the audience being comfortable, being comfortable, being comfortable — then suddenly being very uncomfortable. Which, for me, is the experience of rape, and is the experience of sexual abuse, and the experience of growing up female bodied, female presenting in this world. So often your sexuality is yours, it’s yours, it’s yours, until it’s taken away from you. What surprised you about responses to the production? The predominant reaction to this play is complete strangers coming up to me and telling me extremely, extremely personal things about themselves. We had a student matinee the other day with high school arts students, and three of the students there, two women and a young man, during the talkback shared that they really related specifically to this final scene — a scene where there’s the aftermath of a rape happening. Image From left, Ali Rose Dachis, Nicole Rodenburg, Sofia Black-D’Elia, Midori Francis and Abby Corrigan in “Usual Girls.”CreditJoan Marcus Another thing that surprised me — but I guess upon further reflection, doesn’t completely surprise me — is the amount of older women who have come to me and said: “You know, we grew up in different times, the specifics are different, there are some references I didn’t necessarily get. But the thing that struck me the most about your play is how little has changed.” Any especially wonderful reactions? Last night was our benefit performance. So among an audience that was mostly white — and you know, obviously, donors — an older audience. I saw out of the corner of my eye there was this half-Asian, very young woman who didn’t seem to be a donor to me. She came up to me after the show with tears in her eyes and told me she found out about the show late, the only seats that were left were for the benefit, so she spent $250 as a Christmas present to herself to see this show. She was just getting super emotional and apologizing for it. I kept saying: “Don’t apologize. Do not apologize.” Because so much of the Asian experience is internalizing and not feeling like your emotions are valid, not feeling like the experiences you go through are valid, not feeling like the racism you experience is real. [Sign up for Theater Update, a weekly email of news and features.] I understand your father used to wake you up in the middle of the night to read his writing. My father wanted to be a poet and was a very creative person, and because of various things — his mental disease, his alcoholism, his drug addiction — never became what he set out to be. And so, yeah, he used to come home from the bar coked out of his mind and would wake me up at the age of 5 and have me read drafts of his poetry. Even though my relationship with my father was very dysfunctional, I’ve now grown to a point in my life where I have empathy for him, even though he wasn’t a great person. And I think that makes me a much better dramatist. Did your parents see the show? I’m no longer in contact with my father, but my mother did. It was a very emotional experience for her, and actually the actor who plays my father, when he came up afterward — he really wanted to meet my mom because he’s the nicest guy ever — but when he came up to meet my mom, my mom literally flinched and kind of couldn’t even look him in the eye. It was pretty intense. But then when I was back for Thanksgiving, we were able to have some conversations about things, and I could tell she was proud. What has “Usual Girls” led to professionally? The development deal I have at FX that’s sort of inspired by my life, and has influences of the play, but isn’t directly the play. Following a young half-Asian woman as she’s navigating sex and relationships in her life, dealing with this father who is a drug addict and believes he was experimented on by the government, and also dealing with her mother who has now converted to Judaism, living in a Jewish household. This very wacky intersectional family in Columbus, Ohio. What are your plans for the week after the show? Cry! Cry and then emotionally eat! Anything else you want to say about the experience? Give these supposedly risky plays a chance. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C8 of the New York edition with the headline: Sharing the Realities Of Being a Woman.

arts New Triennial Offers Artists the Canvas of Cleveland - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|New Triennial Offers Artists the Canvas of Cleveland Supported by New Triennial Offers Artists the Canvas of Cleveland Image Fred Bidwell and Michelle Grabner, two of the forces behind Front International, the new Cleveland art triennial.CreditCreditAndrew Spear for The New York Times By Hilarie M. Sheets July 11, 2018 CLEVELAND — The art world loves to flock to exotic locales for shows and fairs. Will it come to Cleveland? Fred Bidwell, a collector and philanthropist here, is betting it will, to the tune of $5 million — his money and that of other donors. “We’re at the front line of a lot of the changes, conflict and currents in the air today,” he said. “Cleveland is a blue city surrounded by an ocean of red. Artists have really been interested in creating new art within this context.” On July 14, “Front International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art” opens with work by more than 110 artists at 28 venues across Cleveland and in nearby Akron and Oberlin. Mr. Bidwell, who conceived and orchestrated the event, graduated from Oberlin College and ran an advertising agency in Akron before opening a museum for his photography collection in a renovated transformer station here in 2013. The museum, Transformer Station, has been a catalyst for dynamic change in a once-seedy neighborhood on the West Side of Cleveland, and was one inspiration for the triennial. Mr. Bidwell was also motivated by his stint as interim director of the Cleveland Museum of Art in 2014. There he discovered firsthand the world-class collections of an institution that doesn’t bring in nearly as many visitors as its coastal counterparts. For Front, Mr. Bidwell has brought these two museums together with six other institutions — the Akron Art Museum, Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland Institute of Art, MOCA Cleveland and SPACES, also in Cleveland. Each has renovated in the last several years, a total investment of almost $500 million that helps counter the image of Cleveland from the 1970s and 1980s as a city in the depths of recession. Image The Transformer Station in Cleveland, a museum that houses Mr. Bidwell’s photography collection and is one of the staging sites for the triennial.CreditAndrew Spear for The New York Times Getting local audiences to buy into the triennial may be more important than luring the globe-trotters, some suggest. “The perception that this would become part of the city’s future and regrowth I think is going to be a key to its success,” said Timothy Rub, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and a former director of the Cleveland Museum of Art. Michelle Grabner, Front’s artistic director, said some artists needed a little convincing. “I know Cleveland’s charms and I had to lay that out there,” said Ms. Grabner, an artist, curator and native Midwesterner. She took artists on tours of the museums and less conventional sites for staging work, including the Cleveland Clinic. (She had collaborated on the list of artists with Jens Hoffmann, who stepped down in November as the other artistic director of the show, and then was terminated from the Jewish Museum in New York City after allegations of sexual harassment.) The lavish lobby of the Federal Reserve Bank enticed Philip Vanderhyden, a New York City-based artist, to create a 24-channel video animation expressing his financial anxieties. Investing in the underserved neighborhood of Glenville, Front leased and renovated two abandoned buildings as a public programming space and housing for visiting artists. Juan Capistrán, an artist based in Los Angeles, made a word installation on the window of the residence’s storefront, which now houses a cafe run by local African-American entrepreneurs. “I don’t want to do an elitist international art fair that has no impact on the community,” Mr. Bidwell said. “Front is really about redefining the city to the world and to itself.” Here is an overview of six Front artists, and where to find their projects. Marlon de Azambuja At the Cleveland Museum of Art Image Marlon de Azambuja’s cityscape “Brutalismo — Cleveland” at the Cleveland Museum of Art.CreditHoward Agriesti/Cleveland Museum Mr. de Azambuja, who was born in Pôrto Alegre, Brazil, and works in Madrid, uses industrial steel clamps and construction materials in their raw form to build sculptures evocative of Brutalist architecture. On a visit to Cleveland, his first, he scouted its landmarks and sourced its primary building blocks at local brick yards and quarries. “It’s a type of archaeology, extracting and showing the bones of the city,” he said. In a glass-walled gallery at the intersection of the Cleveland Museum’s 1916 Beaux-Arts building and its 1971 Brutalist-style addition designed by Marcel Breuer, the artist has raised a crowded village of some 70 structures that appear slightly anthropomorphic and directly echo the skyline outside the window. “The connection is immediate — you see the city and the work at the same time,” Mr. de Azambuja said. Candice Breitz At Playhouse Square, Helen Theater, Cleveland Image Candice Breitz’s “Love Story” features Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore telling first-person versions of refugees’ stories in a video installation. In the next room, videos show the refugees sharing their own narratives.CreditDie Arge Lola Known for her video installations exploring our cultural obsession with celebrities, Ms. Breitz, who was born in Johannesburg and works in Berlin, enlisted the star power of Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore to retell the real-life testimonies of six refugees in her piece “Love Story.” She was motivated to make this seven-channel video installation because she thought the news media were covering the thousands of displaced people arriving in Berlin as mere statistics. Visitors to the black box theater will encounter a large single-screen projection, with the actors alternating first-person accounts of harrowing experiences escaping Syria or fighting as a child soldier in Angola. In a space behind the first room are six smaller screens with the actual refugees sharing the same narratives without the Hollywood charisma. “What kinds of subjects are we willing to hear stories from?” asked Ms. Breitz, who hopes that the double presentation prompts people to measure the two experiences and consider where they’re inclined to invest their attention and empathy. Barbara Bloom At Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College Image Barbara Bloom’s conceptual installation “The Rendering (H X W X D =)” at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, is about “the strangeness of the architecture.”CreditField Studio Ms. Bloom, who was born in Los Angeles and works in New York City, often designs conceptual installations within museum collections that draw attention to relationships between objects. After her first visit to the museum at Oberlin she was struck by both its treasures and the wing designed by Robert Venturi. “It is one of those enormously difficult gallery spaces that screams ‘architecture’ with a capital A,” Ms. Bloom said. To highlight the weird angles, curves and windows of the room, she’s installed on its walls about 30 prints and paintings that depict architecture in some form. From five of these two-dimensional works, including an overhead perspective of an Indian courtyard garden, she has built three-dimensional projections of their bridges, teahouses and walkways coming off the walls and out into the gallery at exaggerated scale and painted an austere gray. On another wall she’s covered the paintings with gray boxes with cutouts that reveal just the architectural feature in the works. “The whole thing is about the strangeness of the architecture,” she said. Yinka Shonibare At the Cleveland Public Library Image The Cleveland Public Library houses an installation, Yinka Shonibare, of books bound in batik-print textiles.CreditAndrew Spear for The New York Times Mr. Shonibare, a British-Nigerian artist, is widely recognized for his sculptures and installations that incorporate kaleidoscopic batik-print textiles — copies of traditional Indonesian fabrics produced by the Dutch and marketed in West Africa. He called the material “a metaphor for my own hyphenated identity.” For his installation “The American Library,” a 48-foot-long bookshelf cutting across the former reading room at the public library, the artist has used his signature textiles to wrap more than 6,000 books. Each is stamped in gold leaf on the spine with the name of a first-, second- or third-generation immigrant to the United States who has been culturally significant to American society, like Steve Jobs whose father came from Syria. “America was built on the contributions of immigrants,” said Mr. Shonibare, who has mixed in names of those opposed to immigration including Donald Trump, whose mother came from Scotland and whose paternal grandparents were German. Dawoud Bey At St. John’s Episcopal Church, Cleveland Image An installation view of photographs by Dawoud Bey at St. John’s Episcopal Church.CreditAndrew Spear for The New York Times Mr. Bey, who is based in Chicago, is known for his documentary-style photographs of marginalized communities, which he likes to bring into the “white box” spaces of museums and galleries. He described St. John’s Episcopal Church as pushing him into new territory, in both content and presentation. The church was one of the last stops on the Underground Railroad where escaped slaves hid in the belfry awaiting the signal from boats to Canada, and it provided a departure point for the artist to reimagine the landscape from the perspective of fugitives moving through Ohio to Lake Erie. He shot his images, without figures, from deep in the woods and marshlands, close up near houses and through the opening in the brush to the lake, then printed them very darkly. The title, “Night Coming Tenderly, Black,” referencing a poem by Langston Hughes, “suggests that this darkness was not merely intimidating but also a tender cover of blackness through which one was moving towards freedom,” he said. The photographs are being suspended from wire cables between the pews. A. K. Burns At Transformer Station, Cleveland Image “The Dispossessed” by A.K. Burns on the lawn of Transformer Station.CreditAndrew Spear for The New York Times An interdisciplinary artist who often addresses the politics of gender and sexual orientation, Ms. Burns, who lives and works in New York, takes on the issue of rapid gentrification in the neighborhood around Transformer Station, once the center of gay night life in Cleveland as well as drugs and prostitution. During site visits Ms. Burns became interested in the omnipresent chain-link fencing delineating spaces under construction or soon to be renovated. Questioning the purpose of fencing off empty lots beyond the “control of how humans are acting in spaces,” Ms. Burns has crumpled fencing material into figurally suggestive sculptures and coated them with iridescent paint. Titled “The Dispossessed” the two large-scale monuments stand on the lawn in front of Transformer Station. “I’m interested in them becoming beautiful useless objects as a possibility for what we might do with fences,” she said.

He died in May, at 38, and his work “The Little Death: Vol. 1” will be revived by the Prototype festival on Tuesday.CreditCreditAlex G. Knight By William Robin Jan. 4, 2019 In May, the musician Matt Marks died suddenly, of heart failure, after a performance with the ensemble Alarm Will Sound. It was a blow to the tight-knit world of contemporary music, in which the 38-year-old Mr. Marks was a prominent presence as a composer, vocalist and French horn player. Along with his prolific compositional output, he helped found Alarm Will Sound, as well as the New Music Gathering conference, and was a provocatively humorous mainstay on social media. [Read the New York Times obituary for Mr. Marks.] This community rallied to memorialize him. Alarm Will Sound started the Matt Marks Impact Fund to develop new works. Several of his close friends completed his score for a theatrical piece, “Words on the Street,” which had its debut in October. And on Tuesday at Roulette in Brooklyn, the Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now festival — which presented Mr. Marks’s opera “Mata Hari” in 2017 and runs from Jan. 5 through 13 this year — will revive his breakthrough 2010 work “The Little Death: Vol. 1.” Mr. Marks’s fiancée, the composer Mary Kouyoumdjian, has become the de facto steward of his musical legacy. “I don’t want him or his music to be forgotten,” she said in a recent interview. They had been close artistic collaborators, sharing drafts and producing each other’s recording sessions. “He was such a strong advocate for my own music and getting it out there,” she added, “that this is the smallest way for me to return the favor.” Much of Mr. Marks’s music draws together a permissive polystylism with a comedic irreverence toward the ritual trappings of classical music. In a 2016 recording he posted on SoundCloud, he dramatically — and hilariously — recited the pianist Khatia Buniatishvili’s hagiographic website biography atop the majestic theme from “Jurassic Park.” But his death has also brought into stark relief the intense intimacy that is the basis of several of his works, which were conceived during — and are partly about — personal relationships, and which now have a new emotional rawness. This is particularly apparent in the upcoming production of “The Little Death,” which Mr. Marks originally created in close collaboration with the soprano Mellissa Hughes while they were dating, and which has not been performed since they broke up in 2012. “I viscerally got sick,” Ms. Hughes recalled in an interview about being asked to revive the work at Prototype. “I couldn’t think about doing it, and it just felt wrong.” Image Mr. Marks and Mellissa Hughes in a 2010 performance of “The Little Death,” which was inspired by their relationship.CreditAri Mintz for The New York Times In 2006, as young New York-based classical music freelance artists, Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes met on a bizarre gig: a PBS crossover special being filmed in Miami, in which their live performance was replaced by canned audio. They reconnected on Myspace, where Mr. Marks had posted some simple songs he had written. As they began dating, Mr. Marks’s compositions became more serious, and he increasingly wrote specifically for Ms. Hughes’s voice, culminating in “The Little Death.” Starring Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes and billed as a “post-Christian nihilist pop opera,” it presented a love story of religious and sexual awakenings reinforced by Mr. Marks’s intricately wrought, omnivorous score: One exuberant duet combines electropop and the shape-note hymn “Wondrous Love.” A series of grandiosely cheeky performances in various spaces in New York, and a recording released on New Amsterdam Records in 2010, were heralded for embodying an emergent genre-crossing scene widely known as “indie classical” or “alt-classical.” Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes worked on Vol. 2, but the project ended with their relationship. “I haven’t even sung through any of it or even really hummed through it since 2012,” Ms. Hughes said. “When you create something like that with somebody, it becomes a part of you, and so when you’re no longer with that person, it’s hard to revisit.” Electronic samples on the album, and passages in Mr. Marks’s libretto, memorialize inside jokes and moments in their real-life romance. “When I hear these things, it’s hard to remember,” Ms. Hughes said. “It’s like an audio graveyard.” “But it’s also beautiful,” she added. “It was a time in both of our lives that we were so creative, and we were young and poor and nobody knew us, and so we didn’t care. We wrote what we wrote.” Image Mr. Marks, center, with Michael Clayville (left) and Jason Price (right) at a 2013 performance by Alarm Will Sound, the ensemble Mr. Marks helped found.CreditMichal Ramus That sincerity was a through line in Mr. Marks’s music, and motivated his exhaustive engagement with musical genres that might be looked down on by other composers. “One of the things that I respect about Christian music and Christian pop music is that they’re willing to get sentimental,” he told The Brooklyn Rail in 2010. “I think you can actually mess with people’s heads way more by going the sentimental route, playing with their heartstrings.” Since his death, moments on the “Little Death” album that might have once sounded arch — hokey chord progressions, campy melodic hooks — can unexpectedly arouse tears. And at the core of Mr. Marks’s compositional voice was his actual voice: a shape-shifting but always identifiable timbre that traversed a range as broad as his musical influences, whether the guttural bellows of his bonkers cover of the novelty song “Donde Esta Santa Claus,” or the sickly sweet falsetto deployed to embody a Karen Carpenter-obsessed, disaffected teenager in “A Song for Wade (This is not that song).” With his death, that irreplaceable component of much of his music is gone. “So many of the pieces that he wrote for himself to sing, it would not work without him,” said the composer Ted Hearne. Mr. Hearne sang in a “praise choir” assembled to accompany an early run of “The Little Death,” and will take on Mr. Marks’s part for the Prototype revival. Since the piece lacks a fully notated score, Mr. Hearne is learning the music primarily by listening closely to the album. “I have to be able to perform it with as much confidence and moxie and guts as he would,” he said. He helped persuade Ms. Hughes to sing, telling her, she recalled, “If you don’t do it, the piece dies with Matt.” “The Little Death” was Ms. Kouyoumdjian’s first introduction to Mr. Marks’s music. She was so captivated by a 2010 performance that, as she was leaving the concert, she walked into a glass door and broke her nose. She and Mr. Marks met a couple years later to discuss a potential collaboration with her ensemble, Hotel Elefant, and began dating. (That project was recorded before Mr. Marks’s death, and will be part of a future release of his music on New Amsterdam.) Mr. Marks was a longtime resident of Brooklyn, and he and Ms. Kouyoumdjian would often visit unfamiliar parts of the borough. One such excursion involved a bus trip — during which they shared a pair of headphones to listen to Mariah Carey — to the serene Salt Marsh Nature Center in Marine Park. Not long afterward, Mr. Marks began a new project, the pop monodrama “Headphone Splitter,” which takes a lightly fictionalized account of their date as its point of departure: The characters Matt and Baby cozily split headphones on the B41 to go bird-watching on a lazy Saturday, and witness a brutal ax murder. “Having this sixth sense of twisting everything sweet into something really dark, he thought, ‘Oh, this would be the perfect beginning for this murder mystery,’” Ms. Kouyoumdjian said. With the director Nick Leavens, “Headphone Splitter” was to be developed into a series of music videos driven by Mr. Marks’s singing, although he only recorded the first three episodes. In Chapter 1, atop swirlingly catchy electronics, Mr. Marks narrates the bus adventure with his characteristically zany swagger — “Baby, go on, pull out your headphone splitter. Sit close, we’ll listen to the soundtrack of ‘Glitter’” — followed by the sudden homicide. “It has so many elements of things Matt that loved so much,” Ms. Kouyoumdjian said: Brooklyn, low-budget horror films, macabre humor. “The music that he was writing more recently goes back to the music he was writing for ‘The Little Death,’” Ms. Kouyoumdjian added. “Projects like ‘Headphone Splitter’ that really celebrated him as a composer-performer, and were projects that he could do on his own. He could write his own text, which was something he loved; he could direct the idea and the vision of the project; and he could just sit at his computer and write and produce.” She is planning to release the two other episodes Mr. Marks completed, and may finish some of the rest of the series herself, although a crowdfunding campaign to support the project did not meet its goal. While Ms. Kouyoumdjian has been active as a composer — she has collaborated with the Kronos Quartet and is preparing a commission for the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth — she has lately focused more on tending Mr. Marks’s body of work. “It’s a lot easier for me to put energy toward his projects happening, at this point, than for my own,” she said. “Composition is really tricky. It really requires a lot of emotional vulnerability, and I think that that’s a space that’s difficult to be in for long periods of time after you lose somebody.” “Helping Matt’s music be a little more public,” she added, “is my way of still doing creative work, but in a way that feels right to me, right now.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page AR8 of the New York edition with the headline: Stewards Nourish A Legacy.

Last year’s Golden Globes “blackout” — when nearly every attendee was draped in black — was an undeniable act of solidarity with the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. But on Sunday night’s red carpet, the energy surrounding the issue of workplace sexual harassment and holding those in power accountable was dialed way back (though certainly more present than at the Emmys Awards in September, where the issue was eerily absent). At the Globes, celebrities, including the hosts Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg, donned black-and-white bracelets and ribbons that read #TimesUpx2 that were designed by Arianne Phillips, who created last year’s Time’s Up pins. “What a difference a year makes,” Phillips posted on Instagram on Saturday along with a photo of the accessories. [Sign up here for In Her Words, our newsletter about women, gender and society.] Ahead of the show, the actress Rachel Brosnahan, wearing a ribbon, said: “While we’re still fighting for safety and equity in the workplace, those are symptoms of a larger problem of an imbalance of power” — the message attached to the new #TimesUpx2 hashtag. She won a best actress Golden Globe for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” on Sunday night, an award she also won last year. Her husband, Jason Ralph, wore a bow tie he said he fashioned on the spot from one of the ribbons. Elsewhere on the carpet, Laura Dern’s daughter Jaya, 14, said: “I want my generation to not have to say #MeToo.” Dern was nominated for “The Tale.” In her opening comments, Oh, choking up, took a moment from the gags to say: “I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change. And I’m not fooling myself. I’m not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real.” The camera scanned to the faces of women in the audience, particularly those of women of color. Not long after, Regina King, accepting her Golden Globe for “If Beale Street Could Talk,” stopped the play-off music with the words “Time’s Up times two.” She then announced that she was dedicated to finding gender parity in her projects. “I am making a vow,” she said, “to make sure that everything that I produce, that it’s 50 percent women. And I just challenge anyone out there who is in a position of power, not just in our industry, in all industries, I challenge you to challenge yourselves and stand with us in solidarity and do the same.” In a statement last week, Time’s Up, which aims to address systemic inequality and injustice in the workplace, said it had been contacted for help by more than 3,800 men and women in the last year. For its second year, the organization is calling for the number of women in leadership roles throughout all industries to be doubled. “We created the fund because all people deserve to be safe at work, but safety alone is far from our end goal,” the statement read. “It’s the bare minimum. Sexual harassment stems from an imbalance of power. Issues of workplace safety for women, and especially for women of color, are but a symptom of the power imbalance that plagues nearly every sector. We won’t stop fighting until there is gender balance in leadership and all women have the opportunity to reach their full potential at work.” Here’s the full list of winners.

arts ‘Change Your Life,’ the Poet Says, and a Rural Idyll Offers a Tantalizing Choice - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Travel Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Travel|‘Change Your Life,’ the Poet Says, and a Rural Idyll Offers a Tantalizing Choice Supported by Essay ‘Change Your Life,’ the Poet Says, and a Rural Idyll Offers a Tantalizing Choice A Brooklyn novelist’s annual trip to the Chilean countryside fuels daydreams of permanently moving. But peace and quiet can be so, well, exasperating. Image CreditCreditHokyoung Kim By Idra Novey Dec. 9, 2018 Every December, while visiting my in-laws in the commune of Limache in Chile’s Aconcagua Valley, we get our eggs from a farm that sells them still warm, at 4 p.m., soon after the hens lay them. My children, confined most of the year in a small Brooklyn apartment, love to ransack the apricot trees in their cousins’ orchard, as do I. Savoring these pleasures during our first few days in rural Chile, I relish the slowness, the chance to wake to the sound of roosters instead of the wail of an ambulance. Part of the pleasure, I suspect, of extended stays with relatives in another country is being able to slip into the rhythm of their days. Every year, plucking Mirabelle plums off the trees with my nieces, I wonder if perhaps I’m no longer the inherently urban person I’ve long considered myself to be — a possibility I mention to my spouse, and every year he agrees he may be ready for a life more like his sister’s in Limache, too. Why neither of us ever recalls that we cycle through this same sequence of conversations each year I don’t know. It is our shared desire, perhaps, to be immersed in the alluring fantasy of being closer to a life-altering change than we actually are. Home, according to André Aciman, author of “Out of Egypt” and “Call Me By Your Name,” is a symbolic place. In his 2000 New Yorker essay “Arbitrage,” Mr. Aciman writes of the fluctuating emotional value of a home, how it alters when you are away from it, caught up in another kind of life. When New York City feels overwhelming, I often visualize the coastal cordillera visible from the back windows of my in-laws’ house. I think of a beloved friend in Chile who took part in my wedding there two decades ago, the red sofa in her living room where we sit every December and catch up for hours. Under the current administration in the United States, I am acutely and continually aware of how fortunate we are to have the necessary papers and the means to visit my in-laws. And what Chile symbolizes in my life is certainly not “home” in the way it is for my husband, and it is not anything like the connection Mr. Aciman describes when he speaks of the emotional “shelter” he found in recalling his childhood in Alexandria, Egypt, while living as a refugee with his mother and siblings in Rome. I was named for a woman who, like Mr. Aciman’s mother, sought refuge on another continent — my great-grandmother Ida Novey. Having a namesake who moved as an adult to a new country and raised her children in a language other than the one she murmured to herself has played a role, perhaps, in my endless mental assembling of a move to Limache. It would be the move of an expat, of course, not a refugee — a move made by choice rather than as a matter of survival. And for my husband, the move would be a return to the country he knows most intimately. During our first long meals catching up with everyone in Limache, I listen to my children speaking a faster, more complex Spanish with their cousins and imagine who they might become if they grew up in their father’s country instead of my own. I start to fantasize about what jobs we might be able to find in Chile now that my husband and I are further along in our careers. After college, I taught in Chile for several years at the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso, and hoped life might lead me back to teach there again. After the 2016 election, I took this fantasy so far I started translating my résumé. But then the second weekend in Limache arrived and the quiet isolation of the parcela, as rural parcels of land are called in Chile, began to feel increasingly like a compound. The drive to get the still-warm eggs felt too long, and even longer when we arrived to find the farmstand closed, as many things inexplicably close in Limache for hours at a time. By day 10, during yet another two-hour meal with a dozen relatives, my children raced from the table without finishing anything on their plates and I didn’t stop them. In fact, I wanted to join them, or — better yet — take off alone up the dirt road beyond the parcela and keep on running until I reached the nearest bookstore many miles away and could collapse there behind a novel. When I confessed my increasing restlessness with my husband, he admitted he, too, had already begun churning up plans for when we returned to the work-filled, frenzied days in New York City that we had been so eager to flee. Why can we never recall this cycle of hypothetical plans and daydreams until we re-enact it yet again? “One merely speculates,” Mr. Aciman writes of imagined other lives, “and seldom does any of it have anything to do with the real world.” My tendency for mere speculation about living in Chile may be partly fueled by how few visitors from abroad we come across during our weeks in Limache. Unlike in other parts of Chile, it is an area without much of an established tourist culture. An hour’s drive to the coast, in the port city of Valparaíso, clots of foreign visitors form along every colorful wall mural and picturesque overlook of the ocean below. But the lush quiet of the Aconcagua Valley isn’t a draw for international tourists. In the town square of what’s considered “new” Limache, families rent pedal cars for children to circle the sidewalks under the trees. During our afternoons escaping the heat, we often come across families from Santiago visiting relatives in the area, or former Santiaguinos who have moved there for more room and a reprieve from the traffic and air pollution in the capital. At an hour and a half’s distance from Santiago, Limache occupies a similar option as a commute from Hudson, N.Y., might to someone with a job in New York City. As in upstate New York where people with city salaries move in and drive up costs, the rising number of Santiaguinos buying up land in Limache has created tensions. Soon enough, I start to fixate on these larger questions — how our half-Chilean, Brooklyn-raised children might be received at a local school. At what age would the insidious role their mother’s country played in the Pinochet dictatorship begin to come up with their friends? What if we went through with the move and weren’t able to find jobs, or found ones, but they didn’t last? By the second Sunday, with the vapor of our daydreams beginning its inevitable fade, the complexity of the move is increasingly plain. It becomes obvious how doggedly our inner conflicts would accompany us here, as inner conflicts accompany a person anywhere. While we pack for our return to our one-bathroom apartment and the whirl of the spring semester about to begin, I remind myself that Rainer Maria Rilke’s injunction “you must change your life” is really about a shift in mind — not geography. And yet, on the hectic January mornings in Brooklyn, bundling up in hats and scarves, my throat tightening at whatever news spewing from the White House I managed to read before getting my children out the door, what prevails in my thoughts of our weeks in Chile is never my increasing sense of restlessness there. It is the little stream in La Campana National Park in nearby Olmué where my spouse and I hiked in our early 20s when I was teaching in Valparaíso and he was finishing his master’s degree. To see our kids playing on the same rocks we crossed two decades ago takes my breath away though we return to the stream every year. By February, shivering on the subway platform, I go back to imagining what job might make it possible to live near that stream again. This past March, when I came across an article about an organic farm in Limache and how it got started, I forwarded it to my husband who replied in seconds that he’d already read it. And so it was our cycle of what Mr. Aciman calls “mnemonic arbitrage” began once more. He uses a William Wordsworth poem as his central example — how, for Wordsworth, it is not the past, “but himself in the past imagining the future” that is the irresistible source of emotional return. Knowing how absurdly we repeat the same sequence of conversations each year does not diminish the allure of speculating, yet again, about the same risks and choices we have yet to take. Two decades into adulthood, it is intoxicating to suspend recognition for a few days of how predictable even our longings have become, to stop and pick a plum in a familiar orchard and imagine what else our remaining years on this complicated planet may hold.

And, in an encouraging sign for those worried about Broadway’s balance, this year’s unusually healthy crop of plays is performing well financially: Five of them grossed more than $1 million last week, a milestone crossed mostly by musicals. “I often say Broadway is a wonderful escape from what’s going on in the world, and lots of people were escaping last week,” Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League, said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” The period between Christmas and New Year’s always brings boffo business to Broadway, but even so, the week ending Dec. 30 was the best-attended (378,910 seats filled) and highest-grossing ($57.8 million) in Broadway history. An astonishing 28 shows grossed over $1 million, including eight that exceeded $2 million. After “Hamilton,” the top grossers were “The Lion King” ($3.7 million) and “Wicked” ($3.4 million), each of which ran nine performances (one more than usual) during the holiday week; and “The Illusionists,” which magically made $3 million appear by holding 16 performances in seven days. The $4 million gross by “Hamilton” was accomplished thanks to high ticket prices over just eight performances. The average “Hamilton” ticket last week sold for $375, and the best seats at the box office were priced at $849. “It is a phenomenon, no question, and it’s changing the dynamics of Broadway,” Ms. St. Martin said.

The financial health of nonmusical plays is particularly significant because it suggests that producers can still prosper with commercial runs of those shows, which had long been a mainstay of the Broadway economy but have since been largely overshadowed by prebranded musicals. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” grossed $2.5 million last week — the most ever brought in by a play on Broadway — followed by Aaron Sorkin’s new adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” at $1.7 million; the Bryan Cranston-led “Network,” at $1.4 million; and “The Lifespan of a Fact” and “The Ferryman,” each of which grossed $1 million. There are 20 productions of plays scheduled to open this season, many of them artistically ambitious and thematically timely, and two of them — “The Boys in the Band” and “The Lifespan of a Fact” — have already announced that they have recouped their investment costs. “Last year my friends in the press were saying, ‘The play is dead,’ and now we’re going to have one of the best play years in history,” Ms. St. Martin said. “The work is resonating.” Broadway grossed $1.8 billion during the calendar year that just ended, with attendance of 14.37 million. Those are both records, although the grosses are not adjusted for inflation; by comparison, in 2016 Broadway grossed $1.4 billion with attendance of 13.25 million. Even a war horse like “Chicago,” 22 years into its run, reported its best year ever. The year’s grosses were bolstered by the presence of Bruce Springsteen, whose “Springsteen on Broadway” brought in $113 million over its 14-month run, but Ms. St. Martin said she was confident that overall grosses would remain strong even now that his show has ended. Statistics for the current Broadway season, which began in May, also show the industry’s strength: Grosses are up 18.6 percent and attendance is up 11.2 percent compared with last season at this point.

By Sarah Weinman Dec. 7, 2018 INVISIBLE The Forgotten Story of the Black Woman Lawyer Who Took Down America’s Most Powerful Mobster By Stephen L. Carter Illustrated. 364 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $30. “It is the curse of historians … to judge the past by the norms of the present.” Stephen L. Carter, a Yale Law School professor and the author of, among many other works, the novels “The Emperor of Ocean Park” and “New England White,” has good reason to make this blunt judgment early in his latest book, which is devoted to his grandmother Eunice Hunton Carter. Her privileged life and her career as a prosecutor constitute a more complicated narrative than the one contemporary readers may expect of an African-American woman who lived during the first half of the 20th century. Image Eunice Hunton Carter, 1942.CreditPhotographs and Prints Division, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library Eunice Carter died in 1970, when Stephen was in high school; he remembers her as “a stern and intimidating woman of advanced years.” But in “Invisible,” which is as much a biography as a reconstruction, Carter has a more urgent mission than retrieving fond family memories: He is explaining, with success and with the clarity of distance, why Eunice was such an extraordinary figure. Her existence so defies retrospective wisdom that when a heavily fictionalized version appeared briefly on the HBO series “Boardwalk Empire” it prompted incredulous, mocking comments charging that the character — a black woman prosecutor, in large part responsible for the arrest and conviction of a Lucky Luciano-like mobster — was pure anachronistic fantasy. But she wasn’t. Eunice Carter did spearhead the strategy that brought down Luciano in 1936, reasoning correctly that prostitution rackets in Harlem, and how they were organized, might be the means of achieving his downfall. Carter was only the second woman in the history of Smith College to receive a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in four years; she graduated from Fordham Law School, started her own practice and joined the New York City special prosecutor’s office run by Thomas E. Dewey. She was the only woman and the only African-American among Dewey’s hires, brought in, according to one historian, for “her command of Harlem pool halls as well as Albany committee rooms.” Carter likely drew inspiration from her parents, William and Addie Hunton. Brilliant and accomplished, they traveled widely as key early figures in the Y.M.C.A. Eunice and her younger brother grew up, in large part, away from each other and from their parents — she was, according to family lore, “their father’s favorite,” despite years of separation — though they did spend a formative year and a half together in Germany with Addie. (Their journey home to America landed their mother in some trouble when the white woman traveling with them was detained, not realizing what a segregated world awaited them.) Image African-American newspapers lauded Eunice’s professional accomplishments as a prosecutor and public figure, noting her success working with Dewey with particular pride, but they were perhaps even more interested in covering her personal life. The Chicago Defender described her wedding to Lisle Carter, a successful dentist, as “a very impressive ceremony” and “the topic of discussion among society folk.” Just a year earlier, she had been a bridesmaid at the most important social event in Harlem, the wedding of Madame C. J. Walker’s granddaughter. Carter’s upward career climb was especially impressive in that overt racism didn’t thwart her choices. But she could never quite escape its noxious hold on American society, whether it was being paid far less than her white male peers on Dewey’s staff or being passed over, in favor of a rival, for a prestigious judicial appointment. Most personally painful, however, was her brother’s fervent belief in communism, which landed him in prison at the height of McCarthyism and led her to realize that her career had reached not a glass ceiling but a glass cliff. Carter’s portrayal of his grandmother is full of love and admiration, though it sometimes tips into overt speculation about her thoughts and emotions (“although Eunice was known for her poker face, she would not have been human had she not chafed at her exclusion”). Mercifully, “Invisible” escapes hagiography in favor of cleareyed portraiture, even when matters don’t fit comfortably into it. This is especially true when Carter chronicles the fissures in her marriage (including the possibility of a long-running affair with the jazz musician Fletcher Henderson) and the deep estrangement between Eunice and her brother, which was not fully repaired by the time both died, within 10 days of each other. A keen sense of loss permeates the book, grief for a ruptured family whose members could not be reconciled. “Invisible” is not only a personal restoration project; it’s the reclamation of a key figure in recent American history whose accomplishments “beat ceaselessly against the artificial but nearly impregnable barriers that whiteness built.” Eunice Hunton Carter’s story is a reminder, in her grandson’s words, that “if you listen with the ears of history and optimism, you can hear the inner supports” of those barriers “starting to slip.” Above all, it proves that one can’t shoehorn lives like Eunice’s into bite-size stories of triumph. Struggle demands nuance. Truthful narratives demand complexity. Stephen L. Carter has revived his grandmother’s voice when we most need it, and with utmost urgency. Sarah Weinman is the author of “The Real Lolita: The Kidnapping of Sally Horner and the Novel That Scandalized the World.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page 25 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: She Put Away Lucky Luciano.

arts What Goes Into Our End-of-Year Books Lists - The New York Times Reader Center|What Goes Into Our End-of-Year Books Lists Image CreditCreditPaige Vickers Sections Skip to contentSkip to site index Times Insider What Goes Into Our End-of-Year Books Lists By the end of a typical year, hundreds of thousands of books in various styles, genres and subject areas are published. These three lists are meant to help you make sense of it all. CreditCreditPaige Vickers Supported by By Melina Delkic Dec. 8, 2018 Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. You may have noticed a host of lists from The Times’s Books staff in the last few weeks — the 10 Best Books of 2018, the 100 Notable Books of 2018 and the Times Critics’ Top Books of 2018. By the end of a typical year, hundreds of thousands of books in various styles, genres and subject areas are published. The three lists, each with its own selection processes and criteria, are meant to help Times readers make sense of it all. “There’s so much competition. If you just walk into a bookstore, you’re seeing tables of dozens and dozens of new books published every week, and they’re each 300 or 400 pages. Most people are not going to read more than maybe a book every couple of weeks,” said John Williams, the daily Books editor. “It is important to let people know, to guide their attention a little bit, to tell them what’s out there worth reading.” And besides, said Mr. Williams, “who doesn’t love a list?” The 100 Notable and the 10 Best lists, in their current forms, have been around since 2003; before that, the numbers were more flexible (sometimes more than 100, sometimes fewer than 10). Versions of the Notables list date back to the early 1900s. The Notables — and then the Best, published a week later — are “the crème de la crème,” as Pamela Paul, editor of the Book Review, who oversees all books coverage at The Times, put it: “Books that have a combination of storytelling power and strong narrative and voice and quality of the prose and extent of the reporting — the package as a whole.” The critics look for similar qualities in their lists, but in a way that reflects their own tastes rather than that of a consensus. “The Book Review is editor-driven” — editors assign the reviews to outside reviewers — “and the critics’ lists are critic-driven,” Ms. Paul said. The 100 Notables come from a pool of all of the books in that year’s editors’ choice recommendations — a weekly roundup of nine recommendations from Book Review editors. Times editors compile them into a document and go through a voting process to narrow them. How The New York Times Book Review Chooses Its Reviewers Oct. 10, 2018 The search for the 10 Best is a separate, yearlong endeavor, beginning in January, with a Google Doc to which everyone from the art director to the news assistant on Books can contribute. (More than 50 made it to the Google Doc this year.) Editors cull that list over time, and the process comes to a close around November with a series of secret ballots. On paper ballots, editors vote from a long list of contenders, looking to offer readers both range and quality in “a broad cross section of everything that’s out there,” Ms. Paul said. And emotions can end up running high. “Editors here feel passionately about certain books,” Ms. Paul said. For ballot votes, people have a few days to vote in the first round, but follow-up rounds are within 24 hours. By the end of the votes, ideally, every editor leaves the room feeling a mix of happiness and pride that some of their favorites made it — “and then very unhappy and bitter about something that was eliminated in one of the final rounds.” The three staff critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — on the other hand, get to have a little bit more fun. They, unlike the Book Review, are not trying to represent the entire publishing industry, but rather to offer a glimpse into their tastes, something their readers like to follow and predict. It’s much more personal than institutional: “They’re not looking to tell you the 10 most necessary books published this year,” Mr. Williams said. “It really is about their favorite books.” The critics have complete autonomy in making their picks (as they do in choosing which books they review in a year), and their 10 best come from the 50 or so books each critic has already reviewed that year. Ms. Sehgal kept a running list through the year of those books that stuck with her most. The final list gave her a chance to look back at “the life that the book had in the world” since she reviewed it, she said, and to bring it back into the public consciousness. “It’s been a lot harder for books to break out this year than in other years,” she said. “A lot of attention is being absorbed by news, by other things that are happening.” It’s why critics and editors look forward to the opportunity “to give the books you love, sometimes books you think have been undervalued elsewhere, a bump,” as Mr. Garner put it. And even a negative Times review of a book does not exclude it from the lists. The book “All the Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr, for example, received a negative review from an outside critic in 2014, but the editor who assigned the book out (and read it) disagreed and included it in editors’ choice, making it eligible to move forward and eventually get to the 10 Best that year. If, for some reason, you do not have time to read all of the more than 120 books, they are broken down by category to help you choose. But if you do read them all, you will have attended “a sort of crash grad school,” Mr. Williams said. “I’m a movie addict, I love TV and I go to live music all the time,” he added. “But there is something unique about books, in that you can continually learn just an incredible amount that you wouldn’t have otherwise if you didn’t read.” Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.

arts Art Basel Miami Beach: Cracks in the Glittering Facade - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|Art Basel Miami Beach: Cracks in the Glittering Facade Supported by Art Basel Miami Beach: Cracks in the Glittering Facade Image Visitors take in an installation by Paola Pivi at the Bass in Miami Beach during the Art Basel fair.CreditCreditCasey Kelbaugh for The New York Times By Brett Sokol Dec. 9, 2018 MIAMI — “It’s better to look good than to feel good” seemed to be the internal mantra throughout much of the week’s Art Basel Miami Beach fair, which ended Sunday. In its 17th annual edition, the fair and a dizzying number of concurrent celebrity-studded events took over the entire greater Miami area. And though many fashion shows and private dinners had an at-best tenuous connection to the actual art, it all looked, well, marvelous. Image An artist’s rendering of the planned home of the Berkowitz Contemporary Foundation, a new private museum that was formally announced during the fair.CreditAzeez Bakare Studios, via Rene Gonzalez Architects At the fair’s V.I.P. opening last Wednesday inside the Miami Beach Convention Center, one big-ticket sale came early at the Gagosian Gallery’s booth as a couple dressed in shabby chic — complete with a military-style field jacket for the gentleman — snapped up a 1957 untitled abstract painting by Sam Francis for $6.5 million. A Gagosian saleswoman directed the couple to two black leather chairs parked in front of their new canvas: “Just sit in the chairs, casual, like it’s your living room!” she instructed as she took their photo. (The couple declined to identify themselves.) Yet behind the glittering facade, signs were evident of structural cracks — particularly within Miami Beach, which is joined at the hip to Art Basel. It was deeply jarring when Basel’s Swiss-based owner, MCH Group, announced last month that it was drastically reducing its international holdings in regional fairs, consolidating its focus on its “very sound position” in core fairs in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong. Following reports of a $100 million loss, it canceled Grand Basel in Miami Beach, a luxury car showcase slated this February for the same Convention Center — one currently receiving a taxpayer-funded $620 million revamp at Basel’s explicit request. Image The Miami Beach Convention Center is receiving a taxpayer-funded $620 million revamp at Art Basel’s explicit request.CreditCasey Kelbaugh for The New York Times The real talk among moneyed collectors was the impact of a skidding stock market coupled with a dramatic cooling of luxury real-estate values around South Florida. While the inaugural Faena Festival was unspooling around Miami Beach’s art-themed Faena House condo building, another story was unfolding inside the three-year-old Faena House itself. The shift in market outlook had produced what The Wall Street Journal called an “exodus” of high-end condo owners (including the gallerist Larry Gagosian), who were selling off their units there, many for millions of dollars less than their purchase prices. Local Realtors have been loudly forecasting that Miami real-estate prices were poised to hit new heights, buoyed by Basel’s annual presence. Their high-net-worth clients seemed to be betting otherwise. A similar warning was contained within an otherwise glowing new analysis commissioned by the Miami-based John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and conducted by the consulting firm TDC. “Evolving Arts Ecosystems: A Study of Miami” took a broad look at the undeniable “explosion” of cultural activity over the past decade in the wake of Art Basel’s arrival, much of it spurred by the $165 million in grants that Knight has given since 2005 to local arts organizations, ranging from institutions like the Pérez Art Museum Miami to scrappy artist-run spots like Swampspace and the Bas Fisher Invitational. (Letter16 Press, a nonprofit publisher of photography books co-founded by this reporter, is also a past Knight grant recipient.) Attendance records at museums have shattered even the most optimistic projections; arts-related jobs continue to sprout; a once-endemic “brain drain” has been, if not reversed, at least stabilized. Image A party at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, which has received grants from the Knight Foundation in the past. Recently, more of those funds have gone to smaller organizations.CreditCasey Kelbaugh for The New York Times However, the TDC report also cautioned that “continued progress isn’t assured. The arts in Miami rely on a limited number of funders, and many of the largest arts organizations operate with little to no operating reserves,” meaning without the six months of unrestricted net assets deemed necessary for financial stability. According to the report, the proportion of arts organizations with less than two and a half months of such assets “increased from 42 percent in 2005 to 50 percent in 2015.” Is Miami a case of too much, too soon: too many arts organizations, too few private funders to keep them all afloat? Image A preview party for the Berkowitz Contemporary Foundation’s new space, where James Turrell’s 80-foot-high light sculpture “Aten Reign” will be among the permanent exhibits.CreditCasey Kelbaugh for The New York Times Alberto Ibargüen, president of the Knight Foundation, stressed that the Miami arts world had not yet experienced the kind of philanthropic generational transfers of wealth that would be game-changing. “The real issue is: What happens if there’s a next Great Recession, if 2008-2009 revisits us?” he mused. The Pérez, the Bass or the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami would “have to belt-tighten and muscle through for the three, four or five years it’ll take to go back to normal.” Mr. Ibargüen was more concerned with the possible shakeout on smaller organizations, and Knight’s most recent round of $37 million in grants reflected a shift toward those outfits — with many being given funds to aid in the purchase of their own buildings and bolster them against the threat of gentrification. Some have already been priced out of the very neighborhoods their presence had helped to revitalize. Image Alberto Ibargüen, president of the Miami-based Knight Foundation, in 2017. During last week’s fair, he described the “real issue” facing the area’s arts scene: “What happens if there’s a next Great Recession?”CreditGesi Schilling Yet against this backdrop of declining endowments, another private museum formally announced its deep-pocketed birth: The nonprofit Berkowitz Contemporary Foundation, unveiled by the fund manager Bruce Berkowitz and directed by his 25-year-old daughter, Chloe, intends to break ground in 2020 on its own 45,000-square-foot public art space. Set for permanent installation are James Turrell’s 80-foot-high immersive light sculpture “Aten Reign,” purchased by Mr. Berkowitz after it was exhibited at the Guggenheim in 2013, and a 180-foot-long wall-like sculpture by Richard Serra. Left unspoken is the likelihood that much of the Berkowitz family’s art philanthropy will now be flowing into its own museum, rather than to the Pérez, where Chloe Berkowitz was previously a board trustee while studying art history at the University of Miami. Image Part of the Paola Pivi exhibition at the Bass.CreditCasey Kelbaugh for The New York Times Ms. Berkowitz declined to discuss the specifics of her foundation’s future budget, except to say that its museum would house new acquisitions as well as traveling exhibitions, guest lectures and a film series. In other words, everything the Pérez currently does. “It’s the prerogative of the people donating what they choose to do with their funding,” she explained. “A lot of people can write a check. It’s a different journey, a different process, when you want to be more involved.” Mr. Ibargüen said that criticizing the spread of private art museums and their supposed diversion of wealth away from their public art brethren was “exactly wrong.” “Who was going to tell Whitney or Frick, ‘Don’t put your collection in your own building, we already have a museum?’” he said, referring to Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Henry Clay Frick. “I consider the Berkowitz coming in to be a sign of vitality, not of weakness,” he said, adding, “I would rather have the variety.” “I would rather have people say, ‘Gosh, I had too many things to do in the arts last night.’” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: Amid the Fanfare, Cracks in a Glittering Facade.

What’s on TV MOLLY’S GAME (2017) 6:40 p.m. on Showtime. This week’s announcement that the actor Idris Elba will be D.J.-ing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival may not have been the news that many pine for (that would be the prospect of Elba as James Bond), but it did bring to light one of Elba’s lesser-known talents. See him here as he plays a lawyer opposite Jessica Chastain in the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin’s directorial debut, a fictionalized (and sympathetic) account of the life of the skier-turned-underground poker ringleader Molly Bloom. Dense with quick-moving dialogue, the film follows Bloom’s rapid rise from the back seat of a high-end Los Angeles poker game to her eventual F.B.I. and legal troubles. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that “Mr. Sorkin has written some sharp characters and cast them accordingly.” But she also said that the film’s endeavor to view Bloom as a victim and put a feminist spin on the story is a feeble one. “By attempting to portray Molly as any kind of female victim — and by glossing over her culpability — Mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency,” Dargis wrote. SISTERS (2015) 5:30 p.m. on FXM. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play sisters with midlife troubles in this comedy, by the longtime “Saturday Night Live” writer Paula Pell. Fey is perennially unemployed, with a temper. Poehler is a nurse who is divorced. Their childhood home is being sold, so the siblings decide to throw a final party there. In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott called the film “uneven, generally enjoyable, self-consciously naughty and also, despite drug use and jokes about anal sex, more concerned with reassurance than transgression.” Image Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Jay Chandrasekhar, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske in “Super Troopers 2.”CreditJon Pack/20th Century Fox SUPER TROOPERS 2 (2018) 6:30 p.m. on HBO. Broken Lizard, the troupe behind the cult classic “Super Troopers,” raised more than $2 million from fans to get this sequel made — and, judging by the results, they had a lot of fun making it. The plot (which Glenn Kenny, in his review for The Times, called “largely unimportant”) reunites the original Vermont state trooper characters as they supervise an extension of the United States border into Canada, cracking jokes all the while.

The great unknown comes to Florida in Alex Garland’s follow-up to the dark sci-fi of his directorial debut, “Ex Machina” (2015). His sophomore effort casts Natalie Portman as a biologist who, along with a posse that includes a physicist played by Tessa Thompson, ventures into a mysterious glistening force field that has descended onto a patch of marshland. “Mr. Garland likes to play with tones, mixing deadpan in with the frights, and later ‘Annihilation’ becomes something of a head movie, swirling with cosmic and menacingly lysergic visions,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. “He keeps the tension torqued throughout this phantasmagoric interlude, sustaining the shivery unease that is one of this movie’s deeper satisfactions.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: What’s On Sunday.

arts Paul Dano’s Cup Runneth Over (and Over) - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|Paul Dano’s Cup Runneth Over (and Over) Supported by Paul Dano’s Cup Runneth Over (and Over) Image “If it’s really clear what a character needs, I feel a little less intoxicated by it,” says Paul Dano, who is starring in “True West” on Broadway.CreditCreditBryan Derballa for The New York Times By Reggie Ugwu Jan. 2, 2019 To the scabrous pile of breakdowns, shutdowns and scandals that will memorialize 2018, a humble submission: Paul Dano, acclaimed 34-year-old actor, did not appear in a single movie. Granted, this might seem a minor point in the grand scheme. But consider this: To find another 12-month span in which discerning moviegoers were deprived of even one Paul Dano performance — in more generous times, there were as many as four — you have to go all the way back to 2003, a year when (coincidentally!) Bennifer, Saddam Hussein and the Chingy song “Right Thurr” were on top of the world. To be fair, Mr. Dano didn’t plan things to work out this way. Far from it! He loves movies and they love him right back. For the past decade-and-a-half, he’s been a constant, animating (if not always showy) presence in a run of good and strange films, many involving a winning bingo card of the great contemporary directors: Paul Thomas Anderson, Steve McQueen, Ang Lee, Spike Jonze, Denis Villeneuve. That it’s not Mr. Dano’s face — a cherubic, inverted teardrop — that first comes to mind when you think of these movies (“There Will Be Blood,” “12 Years a Slave,” “Prisoners”) is a testament to his most durable gift. Filmmakers and audience members alike believe he is one of them. And now he really is a filmmaker, with the release last fall of “Wildlife,” Mr. Dano’s meticulous and evocative directorial debut, adapted from the 1990 Richard Ford novel and starring his old friends Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal. That’s why the actor failed to visit you at the multiplex last year — he was busy realizing a lifelong dream. But that’s not all. Hunkering in the editing bay of “Wildlife,” he missed the physicality of performance. So he accepted an offer — and put on 20 lbs. of muscle — to play a tenacious, convicted murderer who tunnels his way out of prison in the seven-episode Showtime limited series “Escape at Dannemora” with Benicio Del Toro. And there’s more! Really, Mr. Dano has never been so busy. “Dannemora” shot for a grueling six months in upstate New York. During that time, another old friend and neighbor, Ethan Hawke, sent him an effusive text about collaborating on a revival of the venerated Sam Shepard play “True West.” Mr. Dano just couldn’t resist — his cup ranneth over. And so he closed out the year in yet a third medium, starring opposite Mr. Hawke in the Roundabout Theater Company’s Broadway production, which began previews Dec. 27 and opens Jan. 24. Twelve months, no movies and an embarrassment of riches. And none of his professional accomplishments compare to his most personal one, the one that inspired Mr. Hawke to observe in a phone interview that his friend was “truly becoming himself”: Paul Dano became a dad. Image Ethan Hawke, left, as Lee and Mr. Dano as Austin in the Roundabout Theater Company revival of Sam Shepard’s play.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times An Early Start Early on a December morning in the Boerum Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, where Mr. Dano and his partner, the actress and writer Zoe Kazan, have lived for nearly a decade, I met him at a handsome restaurant with dark wood paneling and an antique bar. He was getting over a cold and had a four-month-old at home — he and Ms. Kazan, with whom he co-wrote “Wildlife,” welcomed Alma in August. But he was warm and genial, brightening as he began to report on his fledgling days of fatherhood. “I didn’t think I would like it so much; I mean, I thought I would like it, but it’s really quite astonishing,” he said. In a crisp, black-and-blue flannel, a nest of light-brown hair and olive librarian glasses he could have passed as an adjunct at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. “There’s just a sort of … I don’t know, a hope or something. Seeing something so innocent and pure and unsullied by the world.” Mr. Dano, who has self-diagnosed “dorky impulses” and relishes researching a role, spent that last movie-less year, in 2003, as a New School freshman studying English and Russian literature. To portray the Beach Boys frontman Brian Wilson in 2015’s “Love & Mercy” he learned to play piano. But now he’s found the ultimate research project. “There’s something about being there for the first moments, the fragility, which really begins at conception,” he continued. “And the heart has this chemical reaction on the first breath — the chambers change, because you’ve switched from breathing amniotic fluid to oxygen. And then that breath just keeps going, and going, and it doesn’t stop until we … It’s just mind-blowing stuff.” He was born in Manhattan to a father who was a financial adviser and a mother who raised him and his younger sister (a half brother is 16 years older). Mr. Dano was acting in school plays and community theater as far back as he can remember, “a summer activity that ended up gathering steam,” and by the time he was 12 he was performing on Broadway, with George C. Scott, in the 1996 production of “Inherit the Wind.” At 16, he starred in his first feature film (and won an Independent Spirit Award) as a reckless, libidinous teenager coping with his mother’s death in the Long Island-based indie “L.I.E.” Mr. Dano’s family wasn’t especially arts-oriented. (“They don’t even like good music,” he confessed). But his parents did everything they could to support his dream. With Alma, whose primary talents to date include smiling and using her hands, he can pay it forward. “We were talking last night about how everything the baby does — even if it pukes everywhere — you say, ‘Good job!’” Mr. Dano gushed. He was already nostalgic. “One day that’s going to stop, you know? One day not everything is going to be good.” Image Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal in “Wildlife,” which marked Mr. Dano’s debut as a film director.CreditScott Garfield/IFC Films Out of nowhere, two tables down from us, a man with a puppy-dog grin and a riot of straw-colored hair turned toward Mr. Dano and asked about Ms. Kazan and the baby. It was the comedian and writer Mike Birbiglia, another neighbor of the actor’s, who was in the midst of his own Broadway run. Mr. Dano asked Mr. Birbiglia how his show was going. “It’s fun,” he answered, unconvincingly. A moment later, he amended: “It’s so, so exhausting.” ‘Explosive and Intellectual’ On the 10th floor of a Times Square office building, two weeks before previews for “True West” were to begin, Mr. Dano and Mr. Hawke were running lines in a makeshift, fluorescent-lit rehearsal space. Mr. Dano appears in every minute of the two-hour play, and was already feeling it: “It’s the greatest challenge I’ve ever had as an adult actor on stage,” he said. The story follows two distant brothers with dreams of making a fortune in Hollywood who forge a tempestuous screenwriting partnership. Its solitary setting, their mother’s tchotchke-filled Southern California bungalow, deteriorates along with the brothers’ psychological mooring, and the rehearsal set looked as if it had been turned upside down and shaken for loose change. The older brother in the play, Lee, played by Mr. Hawke, is a feral and felonious hustler, the antithesis of Mr. Dano’s younger, starch-collared Austin. The actors were well matched to their parts. In rehearsal, Mr. Hawke was a bee in a meadow, pacing excitedly, pogoing from one scene interpretation to the next. Mr. Dano, who seemed almost too tall to fit into the fake kitchen, was comparatively dispassionate, soft-spoken. “One is more outward, the other is more inward, so you get this great, catalytic energy between them,” said James Macdonald, the play’s director. “They’re great dance partners.” “True West,” first produced in 1980, has made memorable brotherhoods of Tommy Lee Jones and Peter Boyle, Gary Sinise and John Malkovich, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, among others. (Kit Harington and Johnny Flynn are paired up in London right now, too.) It hinges on a comic reversal, and by the end of nine scenes, it’s Austin’s animal instincts that prove the most vicious. The character’s turn from meek to maniacal is classic Dano. In his two most famous roles, as a conniving preacher in “There Will Be Blood,” and as an electively mute goth in “Little Miss Sunshine,” he plays diligent, abstemious men whose tight lids obscure bubbling waters. Image Mr. Dano with Benicio Del Toro as convicts in “Escape at Dannemora.”CreditWilson Webb/Showtime Mr. Macdonald, whom Shepard personally recruited to revive “True West” before his death in 2017, said it was the actor’s whiplash-inducing emotional range that won him the job. Mr. Hawke, who directed his current scene partner in a 2007 Off Broadway production of “Things We Want” (Mr. Dano and Ms. Kazan, then co-stars on stage only, were reportedly “kissing in the broom closet”), observed someone who “can be both explosive and intellectual, which is a rare combination.” Ben Stiller, the director and executive producer of “Escape at Dannemora,” told me, unprompted, that the actor had been keen to play “a guy who is at odds with himself.” Mr. Dano has heard these appraisals before. “It’s not conscious,” he insisted, back at the restaurant in Brooklyn, when I theorized that he had a type. “But I do enjoy layers — digging around, asking why, figuring it out. If it’s really clear what a character needs, I feel a little less intoxicated by it.” When I asked Carey Mulligan, who has known Mr. Dano for 10 years, whether he is as inscrutable as his characters, she recalled the first time she met him, after performing in a play with Ms. Kazan. “I was quite intimidated by him at first,” she said. “But then I discovered he’s not a serious person at all, really. He’s kind of goofy and really funny and he does everything he can to make people feel comfortable.” Shooting “Wildlife,” she said, was her “favorite filmmaking experience ever.” “He has such a graceful touch and will encourage you with the most gentle push,” she added. “I never felt like I could do anything wrong.” Mr. Dano glanced at his phone, checking for baby updates. With “Wildlife,” then “Dannemora,” and now “True West,” he had been running nonstop, the culmination of 14 unbroken years of momentum. But parenthood had permanently altered his priorities in ways that he couldn’t yet explain. “You just don’t have time for the same things, including work things,” he said. “In certain ways that makes your life easier. And in a lot of ways it makes things harder.” Some roles, however intoxicating, take a lifetime to figure out.

A Short Walk on the High Line - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|From the Earth to the Moon? A Short Walk on the High Line Supported by From the Earth to the Moon? A Short Walk on the High Line Image Oliver Jeffers working on a globe.CreditCreditCourtesy of Oliver Jeffers Studio By Sophie Haigney Jan. 7, 2019 The Moon will be on 15th Street, and the Earth will be on 16th Street, starting on Jan. 24, in a new public installation created by the artist Oliver Jeffers in partnership with the High Line. The two large globes will be displayed on the Chelsea Market Passage of the High Line, separated by roughly the length of a city block, through Feb. 7. The Moon will be two feet in diameter and Earth will be about eight feet; both will be mounted at a height of 10 feet. (They are made from Hard-coated foam, steel and acrylic.) The installation, called “The Moon, the Earth and Us,” will explore the vastness of the universe, the fragility of artificial borders, and the relationship between the two celestial bodies. “We are excited to bring the creative world of Oliver Jeffers to New York City,” Robert Hammond, co-founder and executive director of Friends of the High Line High Line, said in an email. “His books and illustrations are beautiful and connect with a broad range of audiences — just like the High Line. And there is no better place in the city than the High Line to view the sky. With this installation Jeffers is providing our visitors and neighbors with a unique chance to see a scaled model of the Moon and the Earth up close.” Mr. Jeffers is an artist, illustrator and author, and the cosmos has featured prominently in his work. He also has a show of oil paintings opening Jan. 10 at Bryce Wolkowitz gallery that deals more abstractly with the connections between Earth and the universe. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] Mr. Jeffers, who is based in Brooklyn, said that having a young son reignited his interest in outer space, and that the two of them had traveled to Tennessee during the 2017 solar eclipse. They took a flight to the “path of totality,” an experience that informed “The Moon, the Earth and Us.” “It was awe-inspiring, terrifying, eerie, but completely uplifting; you get this sense of perspective pinned to two objects instead of one,” Mr. Jeffers said. He said he is interested in the concept of viewing places and things from different vantage points; the Earth from the Moon, the Moon from the Earth, the Earth from distant space. He said that his experience growing up in Northern Ireland, and viewing the country from a distance, also factored into the making of the piece. “The way I was explaining Northern Irish conflicts from the other side of the ocean was part of the piece too,” he said. Northern Ireland fueled his interest in maps and globes, he said, but also his “disinterest in nationalism or patriotism of any kind.” Both globes will feature text. The Moon will read, “No One Lives Here.” On the Earth, in the places where country names might typically go, it will repeatedly read, “People Live Here.” Related Coverage What Should Monuments Look Like Now? 25 Artworks Reveal Some IdeasNov. 28, 2018 Image The High Line: A Place to See and Be SeenDec. 12, 2018 Image Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword Cooking email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2019 The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions
arts On the Golden Globes Red Carpet, a Retreat - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Fashion Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Fashion|On the Golden Globes Red Carpet, a Retreat Supported by On the Golden Globes Red Carpet, a Retreat Forget black. As awards season began, it was back to business. And then there was Timothée Chalamet. By Vanessa Friedman Jan. 7, 2019 The Golden Globes Red Carpet Fashion 77 Photos View Slide Show › Image Valerie Macon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Thus does the promise of red-carpet change that hovered over the Golden Globes only a year ago — when women took back their wardrobes for the night — get squandered. The co-host Sandra Oh, in an emotional moment during the opening set of the awards show on Sunday, said she could see “change” by looking around the ballroom. But during the dress parade that is the celebrity entrances, it was mostly back to business on the fashion front. And I mean that literally. The red carpet is a marketing machine, pairing stars and brands to optimum mutually beneficial effect. Last year, the collective decision by women to wear black in honor of the Time’s Up movement, which aims to address systemic inequality and injustice in the workplace, changed the equation if not the players. It had power because it felt personal, a quality that has been largely leeched from the contemporary red carpet, where what to wear — that most close-to-the-body decision — has generally been transformed into a business arrangement. It raised the stakes beyond advertising to advocacy, suggesting the moment could be used for more than just moneymaking. Yet 12 months later, it’s still a promise, not a reality. Unlike last year, there was no mention in the post-appearance news releases sent out by the brands of any dress-related donations to nonprofits or other causes. Indeed, the endorsement machine is apparently back in full force, from the jewels (now among the most lucrative deals to be had) to the bags, shoes and — this is a new one — skin care. Image From left, Sandra Oh, Irina Shayk and Bradley Cooper, and Julianne Moore.CreditFrazer Harrison/Getty Images (Oh and Moore); Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images (Shayk and Cooper) Really. Aren’t you glad to know that Laura Dern used Skyn Iceland to “prep her skin before the red carpet,” as an email that I received shortly after said? Despite some rousing speeches from the podium (see Regina King and Glenn Close), most of the messaging — #TimesUpx2 — was relegated to the usual pins and bracelets. While it’s a good thing the movement was there at all, it’s also impossible not to see that as a retreat. To be sure, there were some positive trends. Julia Roberts wore the pants, in black Stella McCartney cigarette trousers under a nude tulle top with train. White was the biggest color of the night, whether Ms. Oh’s Winged Victory Versace gown (she later changed twice), Julianne Moore’s Givenchy, or the tuxes of Bradley Cooper (in Gucci) and Chadwick Boseman (also Versace). Image From left, Emily Blunt, Janelle Monae and Julia Roberts.CreditJordan Strauss/Invision, via Associated Press Ever since Hillary Clinton wore a white pantsuit at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, that color generally has been taken as a sign of suffragist solidarity at pretty much every event that isn’t a wedding. In case anyone forgot, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought it up again last week when she was sworn in to the House of Representatives. So it’s hard not to think some of that symbolism went into these choices. But it was implicit, rather than explicit. (White was rivaled only by green, on Idris Elba, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michelle Yeoh, among others, which was either a sign of new beginnings or, as some posited on social media, ka-ching. Optimism or cynicism? Maybe both.) More provocative were the bondage straps that wound around the exposed waists of Rosamund Pike in Givenchy and Thandie Newton in Michael Kors, as if to suggest all stars are at the mercy of the red carpet rules. Image Rosamund PikeCreditJordan Strauss/Invision, via Associated Press Image Thandie NewtonCreditJon Kopaloff/Getty Images Well, not all: Neither Dolce & Gabbana, recently under fire for marketing videos that were widely interpreted as racist in China, nor Marchesa, the brand of Harvey Weinstein’s former wife, benefited from the night. Yet as they chafe against the demands of the carpet, they still seem conflicted about fighting it — which may explain the fantasy Valkyrie armor donned by Emily Blunt (actually Alexander McQueen), the frumpy Egyptian-royalty look of Janelle Monáe (Chanel) and the I-am-woman-hear-me-roar leopard of Anne Hathaway (Elie Saab). Animal prints aren’t usually a red carpet thing — for years, conventional wisdom suggested prints didn’t play well on TV — which made Ms. Hathaway’s choice a pretty unexpected one. Along with Lady Gaga’s decision to match her hair to her periwinkle cloud of a Valentino ball gown, complete with matching detachable sleeves, it was one of few fashion surprises of the night. If Ms. Hathaway also seemed as if she had wandered in from some other awards show on the Nature Channel, at least it livened things up. Image From left, Cody Fern, Billy Porter, and Timothée Chalamet.CreditJon Kopaloff/Getty Images; Jordan Strauss/Invision, via Associated Press (Porter and Chalamet) Still, that kind of fun-with-fashion approach was left largely to the men, who seemed disinclined to play by the old rules. Instead there was color (Mr. Elba, Spike Lee in purple Versace), print (Darren Criss’s floral jacket), drama (Billy Porter’s bejeweled Randi Rahm cape lined in bright pink silk), gender fluidity (Cody Fern) and just plain old weirdness. As an example, see Timothée Chalamet’s “embroidered bib” by Louis Vuitton, a choice that was perhaps supposed to be a cool modern variation on a vest, but that mostly resembled a deconstructed parachute harness. At least it was a talking point. In the absence of any greater point, that may be the next best thing. Vanessa Friedman is The Times's fashion director and chief fashion critic.

arts When the ‘Mean Girls’ Were Teen Girls - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|When the ‘Mean Girls’ Were Teen Girls Supported by When the ‘Mean Girls’ Were Teen Girls Image Ashley Park, Taylor Louderman and Kate Rockwell, now starring in “Mean Girls” on Broadway, in their own high school yearbook photos. By Alexis Soloski June 4, 2018 They’re the Plastics: shiny, fake and hard. A remorseless, pink-clad teen girl clique, they rule the lunchroom of North Shore High and the stage of the August Wilson Theater. The stars of “Mean Girls,” the mega Tony-nominated Broadway musical based on Tina Fey’s 2004 movie, they’re played by Taylor Louderman (teen queen Regina), Ashley Park (insecure Gretchen) and Kate Rockwell (ditsy like a genius Karen) with what Ben Brantley called “idiosyncratic, carefully exaggerated comic charm.” But before these actresses were mean girls, they were teen girls. Those were challenging roles, too, and ones they’ve all been thinking about. Ms. Fey based her movie on Rosalind Wiseman’s 2002 book “Queen Bees & Wannabes,” a survey of adolescent girl culture that sorted young women into categories like Queen Bees, Sidekicks, Targets, Torn Bystanders and Floaters. Here, the trio talk about their own high school days — the parts they played, the costumes they wore and why they’re grateful they graduated before Instagram hit. These are excerpts from the conversations. Taylor Louderman Role Regina George Age 27 High School Sullivan High School, Sullivan, Mo. What were you like in high school? I consider myself a Floater. Rosalind Wiseman references a Floater as someone who bounces around. I’m from a really small town where you could be involved in everything. Everyone who tried out for basketball made the team because there weren’t enough players. Favorite outfit? Hollister top and bell-bottom jeans with moccasins. What were your bullying experiences? Malicious teasing. I definitely wasn’t blameless. I did my fair share of being a brat, but when you’re young you don’t totally know. Did you engage in social media? Instant messaging, I guess? That was really the extent of it. I have four younger sisters; two of them are freshmen, so they’re just starting the social girl world. They will get upset if their friends are at a party and take a picture together. They’re like, “They’re trying to make us jealous!” Social media can really make us feel isolated as much as it can connect us. What are you most grateful that no one ever posted online? I self-produced my own shows with my mom’s camcorder. I’d invite all my girlfriends over for a sleepover and guilt them into making these silly videos. What would you tell your high school self? I know it sounds so cliché, but: Don’t look sideways, look forward. Because the more we compare ourselves to others, the harder we’re going to be on ourselves. Regina is so confident and I am not as confident. It’s really forced me to work on my inner monologue. That’s the piece of advice that I keep trying to deliver to my little sisters or to any young girls who are trying to make it in the business: Find qualities about yourself that no one else has and love yourself.

What were you like in high school? Definitely a choir nerd. I was just really busy. I did so many extracurriculars: piano, theater, dance. I was really into my a cappella group: Soulfege. The biggest thing in high school was that I’m a cancer survivor, so I spent sophomore year in the hospital. And I spent the rest of my time once I got back to school trying not to be the “Sick Girl.” It’s funny, for so long I tried not to be just the “Asian Girl.” So yeah. Favorite outfit? An immense amount of energy went into coordinating the outfits for my a cappella group. I would rummage the Forever 21 site for dresses to buy in bulk. There was a brown maxi that I was particularly fond of. What were your bullying experiences? Mine were mostly in middle school. People would bully me for trying to be “Miss Perfect.” So I started to answer questions wrong on purpose and purposely do badly on art projects. And I was always feeling like, “Oh, I can’t be good at piano and math because that’s typical of all Asian people.” Being diagnosed with cancer was the nicest everyone ever was to me. Everyone has to be nice to the bald girl. Did you engage in social media? No, and I’m just so glad that there’s not a lot of documentation of that part of my life. It would have been like, “Oh, #weloveashley. She has cancer.” What are you most grateful that no one ever posted online? I block embarrassing things out of my memory. What would you tell your high school self? Have a little bit more fun in high school. I never stayed out late or did anything like that. Buck up when it comes to boys a little bit. I was so shy. I never had to dig deep for how Gretchen feels. Because for me, growing up, if I was ever in the room with a white girl, I was going to be second. I would always be very surprised when a boy would like me. Kate Rockwell Role Karen Smith Age 33 High School Sycamore High School, Cincinnati What were you like in high school? I was at a really big school in the Midwest. We had a thriving theater community. I always knew I loved music and theater and I was able to excel in that environment, so I was very safe there. I never wanted to be a popular kid. Favorite outfit? Probably boot cut jeans and a polo-style shirt that I bought at Limited Too. Flip-flops, as long as it wasn’t snowing. What were your bullying experiences? I remember being made fun of by boys when my body changed, when I started going through puberty. I remember them making fun of the shirts that I would wear, whether they fit or whether they were attractive. That hurt me. Did you engage in social media? Oh my god, I’m so grateful I didn’t have it. Part of the reason I would say I turned out O.K. is because I grew up in Ohio in the ’90s. I was so protected there. I’m keenly aware that it is so much harder to be an adolescent now. You could be the target of an online smear campaign by a girl who’s mad that you wore the same sunglasses to a party. What are you most grateful that no one ever posted online? I directed a madrigal choir and for some of our concerts we rented Renaissance Faire-esque dresses. What would you tell your high school self? I wish I could tell her it was all going to be O.K. I was just a high-stress kid and I was so worried all the time about everything: Does this boy like me?

Sabine/NBC, via Getty Images “If a song’s about something I’ve experienced or that could’ve happened to me, it’s good. But if it’s alien to me, I couldn’t lend anything to it.

By Jon Pareles, Jon Caramanica, Caryn Ganz and Giovanni Russonello Jan. 4, 2019 Image D'Angelo contributed an original song to the video game Red Dead Redemption 2.CreditZackary Canepari for The New York Times Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. D’Angelo, ‘Unshaken’ D’Angelo takes his time between releases. How he’s filling at least part of that downtime? Video games. A fan of the Red Dead Redemption series, he was nudged into contributing an original song to Red Dead Redemption 2. “Unshaken” is lonely cowboy-western soul, produced by Daniel Lanois — an incantation for those with bleary eyes and unswerving defiance. JON CARAMANICA Noname featuring Phoelix, ‘Song 31’ A chorus of “oohs” and “ahs” in jazzy chords, circling without resolution, accompanies the Chicago rapper Noname as she calmly zooms down her latest stream of consciousness. Syncopating her rhymes rapidly and precisely over the tricky beat, Noname touches on her success without a record label, African-American representation on TV, mass incarceration, Christmas and all the direct messages she has ignored, among other things. “I sell pain for profit, not propaganda,” she declares. Her producer, Phoelix, also shows up as a singer with an enigmatic, equally unresolved chorus. JON PARELES Jimin, ‘Promise’ A fine mist of guitar-pop, “Promise” — the new solo single from Jimin, of the K-pop juggernaut BTS — runs in the opposite direction of the familiar BTS maximalism. Here he sounds tender and sweet, and the song never moves quicker than a saunter. In the broader BTS oeuvre, it’s something of an afterthought, casual and unobtrusive. But that hardly matters: It broke the SoundCloud record for most plays in a song’s first 24 hours. CARAMANICA Post Malone, ‘Wow.’ Post Malone’s farewell to 2018 is far more exuberant than anything he released last year. “Wow.” is boastful but not melancholy — “I got a lot of toys/720S bumpin’ Fall Out Boy” — and he’s largely rapping, with only a flimsy skin of melody. After a year in which his album “Beerbongs & Bentleys” helped set the framework for pop’s full-molt evolution, this is a chipper cherry on top, unconcerned with formal innovation and blithely cheerful. CARAMANICA Micropixie, ‘New Year’s Day’ A lurching beat, somewhere in the vicinity of reggae, and a psychedelic-orchestral blur of instruments accompany the high, singsong vocals of Neshma Friend, who records as Micropixie. “How could we ever win the game of life/When all we ever knew was pain and strife/Every day,” she muses. She admits to the hopes that a holiday can raise, then ambles off her own way. PARELES T-Rextasy, ‘Maddy’s Got a Boyfriend’ This quartet from New York writes songs spiked with humorous asides, ska guitar and riot grrrl attitude (so it doesn’t sound anything like T. Rex, or the Marc Bolan tribute act from England that shares its name). The group started when its members were still in high school and its second album, “Prehysteria,” delivers more scrawny indie rock with an extra helping of eye roll. Over the Sleater-Kinney-ish backdrop of “Maddy’s Got a Boyfriend,” Lyris Faron nurses a wounded heart: “She leaves me crying in the sand/she said she never liked my band.” CARYN GANZ Bear Hands featuring Ursula Rose, ‘Blue Lips’ “I love you baby but my lips are turning blue,” Ursula Rose raps, deadpan, shattering the male self-pity and metronomic electro-pop that Bear Hands concocted for the rest of this track. She’s centered; the guys are a mess. PARELES Oh Land, ‘Human Error’ It has been six years between albums for the Danish songwriter and classical composer Nanna Oland Fabricius, who made her debut album as Oh Land in 2008. “Human Error” merges her early dance-pop electronics with skeletal piano and unfurling orchestral arrangements as she sings about the difference between calculated planning and real life: “No missing digits, no real mistakes/Just human errors make human hearts break,” she realizes. PARELES Steph Richards, ‘Brooklyn Machine’ Steph Richards composes in ways that standard notation could never document. To make “Brooklyn Machine,” she yanked out one of her trumpet’s valves — some air escapes where it ought to be, making the muffled, sometimes warping sound you hear in your right speaker. The tinnier tone coming from the left emerges when Richards covers the valve and air passes through the horn’s bell, like usual. The bell, in turn, is covered with a mute, helping her create the fuzzy mumble at the beginning of the track. “Brooklyn Machine” appears on “Take the Neon Lights,” her forthcoming album, but the performance in the video above — featuring abstracted urban scenes animated by Andrea Yasco — is a separate take, just under a minute and a half of haunting trumpet surgery and jostling play with her piano-bass-drums quartet. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Paul McCartney, ‘Get Enough’ Paul McCartney, that Paul McCartney, uses Auto-Tune — yes, Auto-Tune — to sing about lost, lifelong love. “It was a time we were all full of hope/Saw the future burning bright,” he sings. “Do you remember?” Now it’s the future. And all you can remember is when the Beatles wouldn’t use anyone else’s sounds, and when an unprocessed voice was enough. PARELES Jon Pareles has been The Times's chief pop music critic since 1988. A musician, he has played in rock bands, jazz groups and classical ensembles. He majored in music at Yale University. @JonPareles Jon Caramanica is a pop music critic for The Times and the host of the Popcast. He also writes the men's Critical Shopper column for Styles. He previously worked for Vibe magazine, and has written for the Village Voice, Spin, XXL and more. @joncaramanica A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: Listening to D’Angelo’s Cowboy Soul and Other New Songs.

arts Ishmael Reed’s Play Challenging ‘Hamilton’ Will Get Reading - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|Ishmael Reed’s Play Challenging ‘Hamilton’ Will Get Reading Supported by Ishmael Reed’s Play Challenging ‘Hamilton’ Will Get Reading Image Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is the subject of the play “The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda.”CreditCreditChris Pizzello/ Invision, via Associated Press By Sopan Deb Jan. 4, 2019 “Hamilton” has become an industry-changing phenomenon since its Broadway premiere in 2015. But the show has its detractors: One manifestation of this criticism will take the stage this weekend in New York. It is a reading of a play by Ishmael Reed, “The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda,” which will be held at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East Side and will run through Jan. 7. The play, directed by Rome Neal, will take aim at what Mr. Reed — a prominent and prolific satirical writer who was awarded a MacArthur Grant in 1998 — believes are inaccuracies with “Hamilton.” Some academics have long said the show glosses over the role of slavery of the period and have criticized the way Alexander Hamilton is presented. Mr. Neal said in a phone interview that Mr. Reed began writing his play at the beginning of last year. “He was talking about this subject a lot: ‘How they could put up a play about Hamilton and call him an abolitionist when he was a slave trader?’” Mr. Neal said. The play itself is described as being about “a playwright who is misled by a historian of white history into believing that Alexander Hamilton was an abolitionist,” and his path to learning Hamilton’s true story. The work also criticizes “Hamilton” for not including Native Americans and white indentured servants. The plot educates an actor playing Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton.” Mr. Reed, two-time National Book Award finalist, will take part in the readings playing the role of Mr. Miranda’s agent. Mr. Neal said they are trying to raise money for the play to be staged at the Nuyorican once the readings are finished. Last week, “Hamilton” took in a record $4 million in box-office sales on Broadway. At the Kennedy Center last month, the musical received one of its prestigious honors, the first time the institution gave one for a show. Mr. Reed’s issues with the musical track with those of academics who have criticized “Hamilton,” like Annette Gordon-Reed (no relation), a professor of history and law at Harvard, who has spoken out against the portrayal of Hamilton as an uncompromising abolitionist. (Ms. Gordon-Reed is now consulting with the creators of “Hamilton” about the historical accuracy of a traveling exhibition the show is planning.) It’s not clear whether Mr. Miranda is aware of “The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda,” and a spokesman for “Hamilton” declined to comment. But perhaps he might invite Mr. Neal and Mr. Reed to see “Hamilton,” since neither of them has seen the show.

It is on view in New York through October 2019.CreditCreditJoshua Voda/National Museum of the American Indian By Peter Libbey Dec. 7, 2018 The Smithsonian Institution announced on Thursday that it will add a gallery dedicated to honoring Latino-American experiences to the National Museum of American History. The addition was made possible by a $10 million lead gift from five members of the Molina family, who made the donation in memory of their father, Dr. C. David Molina, the founder of Molina Healthcare Inc. The 4,500 square foot Molina Family Latino Gallery is scheduled to open in 2021 and will focus on sharing the stories of Latino communities through multimedia activities, artifacts and first-person narratives. The inaugural exhibition, “Making Home: Latino Stories of Community and Belonging,” will explore the history of various Latino cultures in North America and their influence in the United States and elsewhere. “Latino history is American history, and we have a responsibility to reflect the stories and experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the U.S. today,” Eduardo Díaz, the director of the Smithsonian Latino Center, said in a statement. “We’ll continue to do that not only through this future gallery, but also through our diverse programmatic, educational and professional development programs.” This is just the latest step the Smithsonian has taken to increase its Latino representation. Since 2010, the organization has hired 10 Latino curators and added 8 Latino curatorial assistants. It has also made a concerted effort to devise exhibitions that highlight the contributions of Latino artists and political and social issues that affect Latino-Americans. The Smithsonian Latino Center has existed since 1997, but the Molina Family Latino Gallery will be its first dedicated gallery space. In the past, the Center has been responsible for spearheading programming throughout the Smithsonian’s many museums and exhibition sites. Recently, it collaborated with the National Museum of the American Indian on the exhibition, “Taíno: Native Heritage and Identity in the Caribbean,” which is on view in New York until October 2019. Though the gallery is intended for all audiences, Mr. Díaz emphasized his commitment to connecting with members of the Latino community. “At the end of the day, it’s about creating exhibitions and public programs and publications and web content that relate to a community, the diverse Latino community, who have not seen themselves represented adequately historically in museums,” he said in an interview on Friday.

arts The Paper Published a Holiday Books Guide in 1851 — and Every Year Since - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|The Paper Published a Holiday Books Guide in 1851 — and Every Year Since Supported by Inside the List The Paper Published a Holiday Books Guide in 1851 — and Every Year Since Image By Tina Jordan Dec. 7, 2018 Thanks to the holidays, book sales soar in November and December. People often turn to gift guides — like The Times’s most recent edition — for inspiration. It’s been that way for a while. In 1851, the year it began publishing, The Times ran two holiday gift-book guides — one for adults, which recommended such titles as “The Women of Early Christianity” and “Legends of the Flowers” (“imaginary conversations between lilies, jasmines, violets and the rest”), and one for children, which highlighted “Queer Bonnets” (“a story with a very excellent moral for these days of lavish dress”) and “Contentment Is Better than Wealth” (“admirable tales for young folks”). Beautifully illustrated books were popular then; the paper noted plenty of “heavy cream-tinted paper, broad margins and the finest engravings,” “luxurious bindings” and “extremely rich and elaborate illustrations.” At first, the gift books were largely nonfiction — many of them special editions and keepsakes — but as the years passed, The Times began to include more fiction. In 1877 a popular illustrated novel called “One Summer” topped the holiday list: “The plot turns on an accident to a young man from his eye coming in contact with the umbrella of a maiden.” By 1897, the paper declared that sumptuous, costly Christmas books, those “resplendent quartos and folios,” were “attractive to look at, but impossible to read,” and made a conscious shift away from them: “This year’s holiday books are books meant to be read — books not for a season, but for a year or a life.” [ Looking for the perfect gift? Dip into the paper’s Holiday Books issue.] By 1906, the holiday books guide had grown so large that it had to be split into two issues. An article in the paper that year stated, “We take no little pride in our double Holiday Book Number, which … will comprise 56 pages, and in the rich variety and value of its contents this special number certainly surpasses any previous achievement in literary journalism.” When The Times first began following New York City book sales in the early 20th century, it was clear that the paper’s holiday book guide had an impact at the cash register. Though it is impossible to make that kind of correlation these days, a quick look at social media indicates that many people use The Times’s Holiday Books package when shopping. As of this moment, there are nine titles from that issue on the paper’s extended best-seller list.

With little fanfare, Gillie and Marc Schattner, married Australian artists, have marshaled their brash bronze menagerie up and down Avenue of the Americas from Greenwich Village to Rockefeller Center, along Astor Place and over to Downtown Brooklyn. Their anthropomorphic statues — genteel Weimaraners, ladylike hares and gymnastic wildlife — are leaving behind indelible pawprints in the duo’s covert conquest of New York sidewalks. And in the process, the Schattners have become the most prolific creators of public art in the city’s history, to the dismay of leading art historians. “Nothing we’ve done has ever really been planned,” Mr. Schattner, 57, said during a December Skype call from their studio in Sydney. Improvisation is a running theme for the couple, who first met on a shoot in Hong Kong (Gillie was the model and Marc the creative director) before eloping to the foothills of Mount Everest for a Hindu marriage just seven days later, jilting their respective fiancés. Still, it’s a modest explanation for a pair who have received eight art commissions on the streets since 2016, half of them on public land. It’s an unprecedented pace for a city whose cultural programs come wrapped in streams of bureaucratic red tape. (It took Christo and Jeanne-Claude, by comparison, 30 years of efforts to win approval for “The Gates” in Central Park.) And in August, Gillie and Marc, as they are known, plan to unveil their most ambitious project yet, at Rockefeller Plaza: 10 “Statues for Equality” will depict powerful women, including Beyoncé and Angelina Jolie. The Schattners said that their project intends to highlight the gender gap in the city’s public statues, of which only 3 percent are of women.

After living in Singapore and New York, the couple settled in Sydney, where they became weekend painters. Mr. Schattner was working in advertising, with long hair and a Porsche. Mrs. Schattner ran her own graphic design agency for 15 years. Their big break came in 2006 when they were finalists for Australia’s prestigious Archibald Prize for their portrait of former Australian Olympic swimmer John Konrads and his dog. The Schattners are now full-time artists with a thriving studio enterprise employing 10 in the heart of Sydney’s Alexandria neighborhood, with revenues of $5 million, they said. Their daughter, Jessie, 26, a photographer, works alongside them; their son, Ben, 23, is a composer and musician. And although the Schattners still paint, they are engrossed in their bronze statuary business. Their most popular subjects are “Dogman” and “Rabbitgirl,” autobiographical ciphers that represent the couple’s personalities. “I’m the Dogman and she’s the Rabbitgirl, and we’re riding the Vespa together,” Mr. Schattner told The Sydney Morning Herald. “I’m the person who will push to take more risks than Gillie. I’m the one who is always trying to make Dogman’s penis as big as possible.” Such candor has not endeared everyone to the Schattners’ art, even when it’s motivated by feel-good causes like gender equality and, in the case of the white rhinos, wildlife conservation. Gillie grew up in Africa, “watching an elephant being killed before my eyes,” she said by email. “I vowed to do everything in my power to never let that happen again.” Marc spent time in Tanzania in his early 20s studying chimps. “If we weren’t artists we would be running a conservation reserve in Africa.” Who says they can’t do both? Citing Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, the two define themselves as “popular artists.” “We’ve made terrible mistakes and have gone wrong in the past,” said Mrs. Schattner, 53, explaining the fresh-faced pair’s path to success. “We’ve lost money and learned from that experience, but we’ve also learned by trying things out, failing, and then trying something different.” “We want to make work that makes people smile,” said Mr. Schattner.

The work is titled, “They were the last three and loved staying close to each other,” and depicts the endangered white rhino.CreditPaul van Kan for The New York Times Critics are frowning, however. One of Australia’s most prominent art critics, John McDonald, called the couple’s sculptures “impossibly tedious” and “gimmicky.” New York magazine’s senior art critic, Jerry Saltz, lobbed “bathos-infused folly” at “The Last Three,” the Schattners’ depiction of endangered rhinos, arranged as a topsy-turvy column of Cirque du Soleil acrobats in Astor Place. The Schattners responded to his takedown with an open letter on their website defending kitschy art. What has gone almost unnoticed is how the Australian couple conquered New York City by eschewing the traditional gatekeepers of public art, like the nonprofit Creative Time and Public Art Fund, in favor of some unlikely allies. Five of their commissions have come from Business Improvement Districts, or BIDs — public-private partnerships that oversee quality of life improvements and are funded primarily by assessments on property owners. From humbler beginnings as stewards of street sanitation, BIDs are evolving into cultural programmers, thanks, in part, to the pedestrianization of many New York streets in the late 2000s. While commissions by BIDs require city permits, critics point out that these new art presenters offer too few avenues for community feedback. “This explosion of art, to my mind, is a lot of garbage,” said Michele H. Bogart, a professor of art history at Stony Brook University in New York, and the author of “Public Sculpture and the Civic Ideal in New York City, 1890-1930.” She considers the Schattners’ work “vapid” and “insignificant.” There are 75 BIDs across the five boroughs. The Times Square Alliance was the first BID to commission temporary public art exhibitions, but recently smaller BIDs have begun to recognize the correlation between public art and valuable foot traffic, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the alliance. “This is something happening on a huge scale, with the trimming of institutional and philanthropic funding for the arts nationwide,” he said. Mr. Schattner, whose persuasive charm and brimming smile recall the gifted salesmanship of Jeff Koons, explained, “With public art, you find a location and go for it.” In 2016, the Australian couple approached the Dumbo, Brooklyn BID for their first project, “Paparazzi Dogs” — a pack of bronze camera-toting Dogmen exemplifying the artists’ spectacle-driven signature aesthetic. The sculpture had previously toured Melbourne, Sydney, Shanghai and Singapore. Success in Dumbo gave the Schattners experience they could leverage when courting other BIDs for commissions. Image “Paparazzi Dogs” in Dumbo, 2016.Creditvia Gillie and Marc Image “Paparazzi Dogs” in Greenwich Village, 2016.Creditvia Gillie and Marc But it wasn’t their art alone that beguiled William Kelley, the Village Alliance’s executive director, when the two offered “Paparazzi Dogs” to Greenwich Village that fall. The Schattners volunteered to self-fund the project, as they have with every public art commission they’ve done in New York. Mr. Kelley said he jumped at the chance. Less than two years later, the BID would also exhibit “The Last Three” (2017), billed on the Schattners’ website as “the tallest rhino sculpture in the world.” (The 17-foot-high stack currently resides at MetroTech Commons, in Downtown Brooklyn.) It’s an open secret that very few public art organizations can afford what they commission. Costs are prohibitive because city officials demand work be weatherproof, graffiti-proof, damage-proof and accident-proof. Multiple permits are usually needed, and artworks must be approved by a city engineer. “The Last Three” cost $200,000, the Schattners said, which included fabrication, shipment, installation and de-installation. Even for a large BID like the Village Alliance, shouldering the costs of the single sculpture would eat 14 percent of its $1.4 million budget, which must also cover year-round expenses for street cleaning, public safety and business development for one of downtown’s busiest areas. But art experts said the monetization of public art risks sequestering city space for only the wealthiest artists who can afford to bankroll their work — and saves taxpayer dollars at the expense of the field’s diversity. “Why is it that one pair of sculptors in a city of thousands of thoughtful artists get chosen over and over again, if not that they have accumulated a reputation that is not necessarily based on the artistic merit of their work?” Dr. Bogart said. She added, “The problem with the BIDs is that they go with what’s familiar or think is popular.” The boards of the BIDs that commissioned the Schattners are filled with real estate developers and business people. “It’s like asking someone who isn’t a brain surgeon to operate on a brain tumor,” said Anne Pasternak, who led Creative Time, the New York-based nonprofit, for almost 25 years before becoming director of the Brooklyn Museum. “Professional advising is critical.” Harriet F. Senie, a historian at the City College of New York specializing in public art, said the Schattners “would not be considered serious artists with a capital ‘A’ and yet they have eight commissions? That’s a severe imbalance.” Image “The Table of Love,” a private commission currently at 237 Park Avenue, with two seats for viewers to join.Creditvia Gillie and Marc Yet they could have had more. According to Mr. Tompkins, the Times Square Alliance declined multiple offers for sculptures from the Schattners. “My staff tells me they were very persistent,” he said. Funding issues plague artists working within both the municipal and nonprofit worlds. Jennifer Lantzas, the deputy director of public art for the Department of Parks & Recreation, who worked on nearly 60 exhibitions in the last year, said that artists must often privately raise money or ask their galleries to cover part of the costs. “When we do ask for funding from the city, they can point to a very long and healthy career of not providing funds and still getting a great program,” she added. “Let’s just say that the budget is never enough,” said Arlene Shechet, a leading ceramics artist whose first public art exhibition, “Full Steam Ahead” is currently on view with the Madison Square Park Conservancy, a nonprofit whose commissions receives permits from the parks department. Unwilling to go into debt herself, Ms. Shechet got creative; she entered a partnership with Kohler, which makes plumbing products, and worked for seven months at the company. She estimated that collaboration saved her $500,000 in labor and materials — all for a temporary project. (She would not reveal the exhibition’s final cost.) “Certainly, artists who have resources have a greater chance” making public art, Ms. Pasternak acknowledged, although she pointed out that artists without funding “make guerrilla actions all the time.” (Banksy is the best known example of this approach.) Image “Vespa Riders” outside the NoMo SoHo hotel, 2017.Creditvia Gillie and Marc In 2016, the nonprofit Americans for the Arts convened its council of Public Art Network members from across the country to propose a list of 29 best practices for commissioning public art. One rule states that “any organization or entity commissioning artwork should pay artists for design proposals,” a stipulation that none of the four BIDs working with the Schattners followed. By appealing to a BID’s bottom line, the Schattners may be setting a precedent for how BIDs work in the future, art experts say. After working with the couple, the Village Alliance created a public art program that requires artists to pay for their work’s “fabrication, installation, de-installation, and site restoration,” according to a policy memo sent to The New York Times. Years of experience prompted the Australians to create their art loan program to woo interested organizations around the world. The artists’ website details their sculptures’ market value. They cite “Early Morning Coffee,” a 10-foot-tall sculpture of Dogman and Rabbitgirl at a Melbourne pier, as a case study of their success: one million impressions on social media, an increase in treasured foot traffic, 10,000 Instagram and Facebook posts. RXR Realty, a private developer based in New York, is a happy customer. Michael Aisner, a vice president, says that the pair have been so “absolutely wonderful to work with” that the firm has greenlit five of their art projects over the last year, from the Financial District to Park Avenue. Come August, “Statues for Equality” will appear on its property at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, in full view of Radio City Music Hall. Mr. Aisner plans to wrap the Schattners’ female sculptures around the building’s colonnade like a gang of celebrity caryatids: a Meryl Streep here, a Michelle Obama there. “I find art kind of off-putting and stodgy, but theirs is really friendly and engaging,” Mr. Aisner said. “You can sit down and have a coffee with their sculptures. You can’t do that with the Mona Lisa.” Image A rendering of the Schattners' “Statues for Equality,” including Oprah Winfrey and Beyoncé, coming to the Avenue of the Americas in August.Creditvia Gillie and Marc The couple says they invest returns from their studio operation into their public art commissions, breaking even. Still, the Schattners find the money to travel the world for research trips and site visits, to Kenya, India, Shanghai and New York. Their expansive online catalog provides a cushion, offering nearly 1,000 items for sale. It includes 349 sculptures, 308 paintings, 196 prints, and jewelry and scarves recycling images from their public artworks. Prices range from $5.50 for an illustrated card to $520 for a tiger painting to a life-size version of their “Vespa Riders” bronze sculpture for $60,000. The Schattners have been known to sell public art once it leaves the streets, though they say the majority of sculptures are donated to permanent spaces. “The Last Three” is slated for the San Antonio Zoo in Texas this year after its run at MetroTech. Dr. Bogart, whose three-decade career in public art includes a stint on the city’s Public Design Commission, sees the Australians’ self-financed investment plan as an evolution of an approach begun in the ’60s by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Responsible for monumental installations like London’s “Mastaba” (2018) floating in Hyde Park and Central Park’s critically acclaimed “The Gates” (2005), the artist-couple would spend decades fund-raising for a single project by selling smaller drawings and paintings. The important difference between the pairs of artists, Dr. Bogart said, is the level of outreach involved. The Schattners consult with their BID partners while their predecessors consulted with entire communities. “Christo would come to everybody and do courtesy reviews with everyone,” she said.

The project was scuttled after residents said the image recalled "caricatures of Chinese as dogeaters in American popular culture." It is currently on view at 32 Old Slip.Creditvia Gillie and Marc Indeed, lack of public oversight may have fueled the Schattners’ first New York fiasco, last February. The artists approached the Chinatown Partnership BID to bring their 900-pound “Dogman With Apple” (2017) statue to a square dedicated to Chinese-American veterans. The public artwork was fast-tracked by Wellington Z. Chen, executive director of the BID. But residents complained that the humanlike dog holding a red apple was “offensive in light of the long history of degrading caricatures of Chinese as dogeaters in American popular culture.” The artists were hit with a cease-and-desist petition signed by nearly 1,200 people and the project was scuttled. The Schattners said they were blindsided by the criticism, pointing out that the sculpture had been exhibited in Shanghai previously without complaint. “Seventy-five BIDs have sponsored some 147 artworks,” said Mr. Chen. “Some are horrible. Some are ugly. But do you hear about them? No.” Amy Chin, a community organizer in the neighborhood for 30 years who helped draft the petition, sees the issue differently. “Being public, art has to be responsive to its surrounding community,” she said in an interview. Ms. Chin added, “The BID had no public process installed because they thought the sculpture would be a gift to the community.” But is this gift actually intended for residents, or for businesses? “Merchants are bleeding,” Mr. Chen said. “Even if it was a Donald Trump sculpture, I would put it out there if it would increase foot traffic.” The majority of public art projects, including BID street art, must be approved by the Department of Transportation, the Parks Department, or both. These municipal agencies have boards and advisory committees that review submissions for permits, but Wendy Feuer, assistant commissioner for urban design and art at the transportation department, acknowledges that the agency had no formal art program until 2007. “We were sort of inventing it as we go,” she explained. One mission “is quite frankly to put art on the streets of New York City,” Ms. Feuer added. “While quality is important, people will always debate what’s good or bad art.” Image The Schattners are studying gorillas in Uganda as they plan a giant King Kong sculpture for the city, shown in a rendering near Fifth Avenue.Creditvia Gillie and Marc Tom Finkelpearl, the city’s commissioner of cultural affairs, conceded that “self-funding is an issue,” generally speaking, in the field of public art. But he added, “I don’t think the art ecosystem is broken, I think it’s quite healthy.” He pointed to his department’s $10 million commitment over the next four years for permanent public monuments, including a new statue of Shirley Chisholm in Prospect Park. They will be reviewed by a public design commission that includes artists, art historians and museum trustees. “I haven’t seen a groundswell of opposition to what’s going on with the BIDs,” Mr. Finkelpearl said. “If I began to sense that people are upset, then we would look into it.” Such actions might include consulting the city’s Department of Small Business Services or commissioning a report. For artists simply trying to bring joy into the streets, the Schattners feel like the art world is disproportionately set against them. “We want to put a lot more heart into public spaces, more soul and humanity,” Mr. Schattner said. Why should people be so opposed? “Critics don’t speak for everybody and certainly not for the populace,” he added. “Even if we get slammed, that wouldn’t touch me if I knew that the public enjoyed it,’ Mrs. Schattner said. Besides, the two Aussies have much more ambitious plans for New York. Recently the couple flew to Uganda to study the country’s endangered mountain gorilla population for their largest conservation sculpture yet. One day, they hope to install a gargantuan King Kong on the city’s skyline. Maybe their mega-sized ape will tower over Central Park. Maybe he’ll splay across Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Schattner, with ambition in her voice, said the sculpture is still in its early stages. “But wouldn’t it be amazing for New York to save the gorillas?” Related Coverage N.Y.

arts Ellen DeGeneres: Academy Should Reinstate Kevin Hart as Oscars Host - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|Ellen DeGeneres: Academy Should Reinstate Kevin Hart as Oscars Host Supported by Ellen DeGeneres: Academy Should Reinstate Kevin Hart as Oscars Host Image Kevin Hart, in his appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”CreditCreditNBC By Sopan Deb Jan. 4, 2019 During an interview with the comedian Kevin Hart broadcast on Friday, Ellen DeGeneres offered a lengthy defense of Hart and said that she called someone at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to request that he be reinstated as Oscars host. Almost a month ago, Hart stepped down from that role after a backlash over past comments he had made that were considered homophobic. In this conversation, @KevinHart4real was authentic and real, and I’m in his corner. #OscarsNeedHart https://t.co/nhMwSefrMl— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 4, 2019 “I called the academy today because I really want you to host the Oscars,” DeGeneres told Hart. “I was so excited when I heard that they asked you. I thought it was an amazing thing. I knew how important it was and how it was a dream.” “So I called them. I said, ‘Kevin’s on.’ I said, ‘I have no idea if he wants to come back and host. But what are your thoughts?’ And they were like, ‘Oh my God. We want him to host. We feel like that maybe he misunderstood or it was handled wrong or maybe we said the wrong thing, but we want him to host.’” She added: “The academy is saying, ‘What can we do to make this happen?’” It’s unclear whom DeGeneres spoke to. The academy did not respond to a request for comment and has not announced a replacement host for Hart. Hart told DeGeneres that he took responsibility for his past comments, which include a now deleted tweet from 2011 in which he said, “Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay,’” and a 2009 post on Twitter in which he used a homophobic slur. There was also Hart’s 2010 comedy special, “Seriously Funny”: As part of an extended riff, he said, “Me, as a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will.” But Hart, who was also promoting his new movie “The Upside,” also said the campaign to have him ousted as Oscars host was meant to “destroy” him. “On my side, openly, I say I’m wrong for my past words,” Hart told DeGeneres. “I say it. I said it.” “I understand that,” he continued. “I know that. My kids know when their dad messes up, I’m in front of it because I want to be an example so they know what to do. In this case, it’s tough for me because it was an attack. This wasn’t an accident. This wasn’t a coincidence. It wasn’t a coincidence that the day after I received the job that tweets just somehow manifested from 2008.” “To go through 40,000 tweets to get back to 2008, that’s an attack,” he added. “That’s a malicious attack on my character. That’s an attack to end me.” He told DeGeneres that he was re-evaluating whether to host the Oscars (it’s unclear if that decision is up to him). But on Friday, Variety posted an interview it conducted with Hart, before he had spoken to DeGeneres, in which he shut the door on ever hosting the Oscars. “Would I ever do it?” Hart said, according to Variety. “No, it’s done. It’s done. In my mind I got the job, it was a dream job, and things came up that simply prohibited it from happening. But I don’t believe in going backwards.” Hart stepped down as Oscars host two days after it was announced that he got the job. Hosting was one of his top career goals, he told DeGeneres, because “there hasn’t been a lot of African-American comedians that have been able to do it.” As old comments resurfaced, Hart was initially defiant, declining to apologize. “If you don’t believe that people change, grow, evolve as they get older, I don’t know what to tell you,” Hart said in an Instagram video. “If you want to hold people in a position where they always have to justify or explain the past, then do you. I’m the wrong guy, man. I’m in a great place. A great mature place where all I do is spread positivity.” But six hours later, he stepped down. “I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year’s Oscar’s,” the 39-year-old said on Twitter. “This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the L.G.B.T.Q. community for my insensitive words from my past.” Hart said on “Ellen” that he initially didn’t address the criticism because “when you feed into that stuff, you only add more fuel to the fire.” “When it happened, my first thought is, ‘I’m going to ignore it,’” he said, adding, “I don’t have a homophobic bone in my body.” “I’ve yet to go back to that version of the immature comedian that once was,” he said. “I’ve moved on. I’m a grown man.” Hart hasn’t addressed his past comments often, but he did so in the case of the joke from his 2010 special about his son being gay. Hart told Rolling Stone in 2015, “I wouldn’t tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren’t as sensitive as they are now.” DeGeneres posted clips from the interview on Twitter, with this accompanying text: “I believe in forgiveness. I believe in second chances. And I believe in @kevinhart4real.” In a follow-up tweet, she said, “In this conversation, @kevinhart4real was authentic and real, and I’m in his corner. #OscarsNeedHart.” In the interview, DeGeneres, who is one of the most prominent gay celebrities working today and has also hosted the Academy Awards, played down the criticism that emerged over Hart hosting the ceremony. The interview was originally going to air this coming Monday, but the show decided to broadcast it on Friday. “Whatever is going on in the internet, don’t pay attention to them,” she said. “That’s a small group of people being very loud. We are a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars.” DeGeneres’s embrace of Hart was met with criticism on social media. Adam B. Vary, a senior film reporter for Buzzfeed, said, “It’s depressing that Ellen’s enthusiasm for Hart hosting the Oscars — and he would’ve been a good host! — led her to contribute to a narrative that Hart is the victim of ‘haters’ & ‘trolls’ out to ‘destroy’ him.” DeRay Mckesson, the Black Lives Matter activist, wrote on Twitter: “I expected Ellen to actually ask Kevin Hart some sort of challenging question. Anything, really. But instead, it was just one long monologue from Kevin interspersed with Ellen’s approval. That interview made me miss the previous talk show hosts that asked tough questions.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: DeGeneres Wants Hart Back as Oscars Host.

arts Letters to the Editor - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Letters to the Editor Supported by Letters to the Editor Jan. 4, 2019 Alice Walker To the Editor: We were deeply disturbed to learn that among the books on Alice Walker’s nightstand is a profoundly and unambiguously anti-Semitic work by the notorious conspiracy theorist and fearmonger David Icke (By the Book, Dec. 16). “And the Truth Shall Set You Free” is hardly the inspirational “curious person’s dream” Walker makes it out to be. In fact, the book is replete with raw anti-Semitism and nods to Holocaust denial. Icke calls Judaism an “incredibly racist” religion that preaches “racial superiority.” He claims that a “Jewish clique” fomented World War I and World War II as well as the Russian Revolution. He draws heavily on the notorious 19th-century Russian fabrication “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” for inspiration. He even goes so far as to cast doubt on the Holocaust, claiming that the history of the Nazi period has been “tampered with,” condemning the Nuremberg trials and promoting the dissemination of “alternative information to the official line of the Second World War.” Walker has a right to read what she will, but the Book Review has a responsibility to fact-check its material and forewarn readers if the book being recommended to readers is a conspiratorial polemic by a writer with a long history of scapegoating groups of Jews and blaming them for many of the ills of the modern world. JONATHAN A. GREENBLATT NEW YORK The writer is C.E.O. and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. ♦ To the Editor: I write to register my disappointment with seeing Alice Walker’s nod to David Ickes in the Book Review. It was so sad to see that name, unremarked upon by your interviewer, legitimized in the paper of record. I wonder how many people will be turned on to Icke’s ideas or think they now have a green light to publicly voice anti-Semitism based on them. I can’t think of a solution that wouldn’t extend and amplify the controversy, thereby giving Icke additional publicity. I just ask that you and your colleagues be more mindful of the positions you hold and the role The New York Times plays in sketching the bounds of acceptable discourse among a segment of society.

arts Hannah Ryggen Wove Politics Into Her Gorgeous Tapestries - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Arts Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Arts|Hannah Ryggen Wove Politics Into Her Gorgeous Tapestries Supported by Hannah Ryggen Wove Politics Into Her Gorgeous Tapestries Image An exhibition at Modern Art Oxford is the largest of Hannah Ryggen’s works ever staged in Britain.CreditCredit2017 Hannah Ryggen/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; The Modern Art Oxford By Hettie Judah Dec. 1, 2017 OXFORD, England — On July 22, 2011, Hannah Ryggen’s tapestry “We Are Living on a Star” was hanging in the Cabinet Building in Oslo’s Regjeringskvartalet, or government quarter, when a car bomb exploded in the street outside. Eight people died in the blast, which damaged the offices of the prime minister, as well as the finance and oil ministries. Ms. Ryggen’s tapestry was torn and showered with splinters of glass and other flying debris. “We Are Living on a Star” unites two enduring themes of Ms. Ryggen’s work: her broadly socialist, anti-fascist response to world events, and a profound love for her family and the living earth that sustained it. Commissioned in 1958 for the Cabinet Building by its architect, Erling Viksjo, Ms. Ryggen’s 13-foot-high, hand-woven work shows monumental male and female figures embracing before a blue ovoid form that represents the world, suspended amid planets in a night sky. Since repaired, this scarred work, with its explicit message of global solidarity, has become an emblem of collective memory, lending its name to a 2014 exhibition at the Henie Onstad Arts Center, south of Oslo, in which artists responded to the events of that day in 2011. According to Emma Ridgway, senior curator at Modern Art Oxford, “We Are Living on a Star” is now considered too culturally important to risk its traveling for exhibition abroad, but 15 sizable works by Ms. Ryggen, who died in 1970, are on display through Feb. 18 at the Oxford museum, in the first major examination of the artist’s work in Britain. Image “Etiopia” was shown in the Norwegian pavilion at the Paris Expo of 1937.Credit2017 Hannah Ryggen/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Anders S. Solberg, via Nordenfjeldske Kunstindustrimuseum Among the earliest works is the frieze-like “Etiopia,” Ms. Ryggen’s furious response to the Italian occupation of Ethiopia in 1936. Portraits of the Emperor Haile Selassie and Italy’s King Victor Emmanuel III are set above a large geometrically patterned rug panel suggesting Ms. Ryggen’s kinship with African weavers. “Etiopia” was shown by Norway at the Paris Expo of 1937 in the pavilion adjacent to Spain, where Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” offered a horrified response to the Nazi bombing of a Basque town during the Spanish Civil War. Even in such company, Ms. Ryggen’s work was censored: An upper portion of the tapestry, showing Benito Mussolini’s decapitated head held aloft by an Ethiopian soldier, was folded over to avoid offending Italians. Born to a working class Swedish family in 1894, Ms. Ryggen trained as a portrait painter before turning to the loom. On a trip to Dresden, Germany, as a young woman, she immersed herself in the work of Vermeer, Goya and El Greco. She was likewise versed in the art of her own time, making repeat visits to the huge 1914 Baltic Exhibition in Malmo, Sweden, at which paintings by Kandinsky and the German expressionist group Die Brücke were shown. A spirited early self-portrait on display at Oxford shows Ms. Ryggen’s considerable skill as a painter. Her turn to tapestry, and with it, her interest in craft traditions and the eccentric compositions of medieval art, was explicitly political. A tapestry was a mobile messenger: it could be nimbly rolled up, transported and displayed without sustaining damage as a painting might. Ms. Ridgway sees Ms. Ryggen as a figure ahead of her time: “She was making her art to contribute to public conversations about equality: hard enough today, but as a woman, then, it was even more so.” Ms. Ryggen gave almost all of her major tapestries to public institutions, hoping they would be widely seen. After moving to a remote area near Trondheim, Norway, in 1924, she and her husband Hans lived off the land they farmed. Raising sheep for wool, and making her own dyes from local moss, lichen, bark and plants (and the contents of a chamber pot), tapestry freed her from dependence on commercial materials. Created after a decade of self-education, Ms. Ryggen’s first mature political tapestry “Fishing in the Sea of Debt” (1933), shows starving families drowning in a blood-red fjord while a plump debt-collector’s wife looks on from her picnic blanket. The Great Depression had hit Norway, bringing high unemployment and terrible deprivation. With its strong, roiling colors, and expressionistic style, the work suggests the influence of the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. Like all of Ms. Ryggen’s tapestries, it was created directly on the loom without preparatory sketches.

The central suite of works in the Oxford exhibition address Nazi atrocities first in Germany, then Norway, and their eventual impact on Ms. Ryggen’s family. In “Death of Dreams” (1936), the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky is pictured imprisoned, shortly after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. Two years later Mr. von Ossietzky was executed. A separate tapestry shows another figure in the German resistance to Nazism, Liselotte Herrmann, who was also executed in 1938. The extraordinary “6 October 1942” shows the shooting of Henry Gleditsch, the director of Trondheim’s Trondelag Theater. Above a Pietà-like scene of Mr. Gleditsch’s death, Hitler flies through Norwegian skies farting oak leaves as a symbol of German strength. The Ryggen family is seen floating in a boat of roses on the panel to the right: between the two sides stands Winston Churchill in a barricaded tower. Neither love nor military intervention could protect the Ryggen family: two years later Hans was imprisoned.

Johnson’s beagle made headlines after the president had lifted the dog by its ears during a photography shoot. As a contemporary report in The Times noted: “Some authorities on dogs questioned the President’s handling.” In the following days, debate around the incident seemed to eclipse coverage of the Vietnam War. According to Ms. Ridgway, the news media’s focus on comparatively trivial outrages dismayed the artist. ”She was horrified by reports of the war, and was angry that coverage of the brutal loss of life in another country had been overshadowed by the media focus on the behavior of President Johnson as an individual,” the curator said. Having relied on media sources for inspiration throughout her working life, Ms. Ryggen’s disquiet over the way the president’s public behavior could draw our focus away from more important international issues seems, as with many of the artist’s other concerns, remarkably prescient.

arts Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Passion for Puerto Rico - The New York Times Theater|Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Passion for Puerto Rico Image “I believe I owe a great deal of who I am to this island” — Lin-Manuel Miranda, at a coffee farm in Jayuya, P.R.CreditCreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times Sections Skip to contentSkip to site index Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Passion for Puerto Rico The island has shaped the “Hamilton” creator’s identity. Now he’s bringing the musical to San Juan, and things are getting complicated. “I believe I owe a great deal of who I am to this island” — Lin-Manuel Miranda, at a coffee farm in Jayuya, P.R.CreditCreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times Supported by By Michael Paulson Dec. 26, 2018 VEGA ALTA, P.R. — The road to Vega Alta is lined with Lin-Manuel Miranda. Literally. Just next to the arched stone welcome sign is a billboard with a large photo of the “Hamilton” creator, and a hashtag — #YoSoyVegaAlta — meaning “I am Vega Alta.” This is the town where his father is from, where he and his sister spent summers as kids, where their aunt and uncle still live. It’s also a community that has seen better days — challenged by joblessness and crime and a town center dotted with vacancies. Now, at the heart of the commercial district, in a space that once housed a disco called the Pink Panther, is La Placita de Güisin, an arcade built by Luis Miranda, Lin-Manuel’s father, who left for New York when he was 18, but never stopped coming back. It features a bakery, a barista and a cafe; there is a gift shop selling Lin-Manuel Miranda merchandise (yes, he has a merchandise line), as well as a mosaic mural depicting him and his grandfather. Image Mr. Miranda was born and raised in New York, but he spent a month each summer in Puerto Rico throughout his childhood. Mr. Miranda, preparing to reassume the title role of “Hamilton” for a three-week run that begins in San Juan on Jan. 11, arrived in Vega Alta one rainy Tuesday night this fall like the celebrity he has become. He and his father, accompanied by publicists and staffers and a documentary film crew, took a private plane to the island and then a black S.U.V. to Vega Alta, where they were celebrating local arts organizations the family is assisting as part of their intensified philanthropic efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which slammed into Puerto Rico last year. A dozen amped-up adolescents, some wearing A. Ham hats, cornered him by the mural and, from memory (O.K., one or two of them were peeking at cellphone screens), performed an a cappella version of the musical’s opening number, led by their high school English teacher, Edd Ramos, who has been using the show’s coffee-table tome as a textbook. Image “Just you wait!” Mr. Miranda joined in as local high school students performed the opening number of “Hamilton” for him at a gathering in Vega Alta, P.R.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times Mr. Miranda, sporting Spider-Man sneakers, leapt into the scrum, singing and dancing along with the teenagers, videotaping them as they videotaped him. Then, under a tent erected over a side street, he and his father sat in the front row, nodding their heads and joining the crowd as the singer-songwriter Antonio Cabán Vale, known as El Topo, performed “Verde Luz,” a danza that has come to symbolize Puerto Rican pride. “He’s like a lighthouse for Puerto Rico now,” said one of the many assembled well-wishers, Alejandro García Padilla, a former governor of Puerto Rico. Mr. García Padilla is an unabashed fan who plays the “Hamilton” cast album in the car while driving his kids to school and has not only seen the musical twice in New York but has also stopped by Trinity Church to visit Alexander Hamilton’s grave. “He is worldwide famous, but he cares about his people, he cares about his country, he cares about Puerto Rico. He doesn’t forget about us.” But even lighthouses get battered by waves. Mr. Miranda’s passion for Puerto Rico has also led to controversy — particularly because he supported a debt restructuring plan that is overseen by an unpopular federal oversight board, and then chose a theater for “Hamilton” at the University of Puerto Rico, which is being roiled by the board’s fiscal plan as well as a union dispute. For some, the musical, a blockbuster hit about colonists fighting for independence, offered a tempting opportunity to call attention to their concerns. So earlier this month, with Mr. Miranda’s blessing but also to his great disappointment, the producers of “Hamilton” decided to relocate the San Juan production from the demonstration-prone university to an easier-to-secure off-campus theater. ‘Questions He’s Always Thinking About’ Image Mr. Miranda has never lived in Vega Alta, but it’s the town where his father is from, and there are “#YoSoyVegaAlta” billboards featuring him on the road to town and in the town center.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times Lin-Manuel Miranda is a New Yorker, born and bred. He has spent most of his nearly 39 years living in Upper Manhattan; he attended New York public schools, and his career was established on New York’s stages. But Puerto Rico offers a thread, a theme, a thesis for his life. It’s the homeland where both of his parents grew up. It’s the place he long idealized, where many now idealize him. As we talked about how Puerto Rico shaped his personal, political and artistic identity, he mused aloud about questions he has grappled with. What does it mean to feel nostalgia for a place you never lived, a place your parents loved but left? How does fame affect the way you see, and are seen, in that place? “I believe I owe a great deal of who I am to this island,” he said as we drove from a coffee plantation deep in the mountains to the theater in San Juan where he hoped “Hamilton” would be staged. “It’s a tactile thing. It’s a tempo thing. It’s the pace of life here,” he said when I asked what about Puerto Rico he would want to pass along to his own children — two sons, both very young. “It’s the way the world sounds at night. It’s seeing the stars. It’s this oneness with nature that is very natural and real. It is all the things you cannot get in New York City. And it is its culture, because the kindest people I know are here.” Image “It’s a bat signal to your countrymen,” Mr. Miranda said of his decision to wave a Puerto Rican flag at the 2008 Tony Awards.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times His identification with this United States commonwealth 1,600 miles south of New York has informed his biggest successes — “In the Heights,” about a Caribbean-American community formed around a bodega in Northern Manhattan, and “Hamilton,” whose title character is a Caribbean immigrant who becomes an American founding father. “This idea of who you are in one place, and how different or similar that is to who you are in another place, has been present from the first conversation I had with him,” said Thomas Kail, one of Mr. Miranda’s closest creative collaborators, a fellow Wesleyan University alumnus who directed both “Heights” and “Hamilton.” “It’s something Lin writes about in all of his shows — ‘Who am I?’, ‘Where am I from?’ and ‘Have I done enough’?” Mr. Kail said. “Those are the questions he’s always thinking about.” Mr. Miranda first visited Vega Alta, which is about 20 miles west of San Juan, as an 8-week-old infant, and later he started spending a month in the town every summer, accompanied by his sister. Days were occupied with his grandmother, who ran a travel agency, and his grandfather, a manager at the credit union. There were hours exploring — trying to catch lizards; marveling at the moriviví, a plant that shrinks from human touch; savoring quenepas, a tropical fruit (as well as Chef Boyardee and McDonald’s French fries). “It’s the closest thing I have to literally a town where everybody knows your name,” Mr. Miranda said. As he got a little older, he indulged a growing passion: filmmaking. His grandfather borrowed a security camera from the credit union, and Mr. Miranda used it to shoot battles between G.I. Joes, explosions of blood capsules, and, memorably, a scene in which he tossed a fake body, fashioned out of stuffed clothing, from his grandparents’ roof, alarming the woman next door, who at first did not realize the body was a prop. Image Margot Rodríguez lived next door to the Mirandas. That meant she was called upon to act in some of the young Lin-Manuel’s first films.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times That neighbor, Margot Rodríguez, was often featured in Mr. Miranda’s films — she would pretend to faint, or to sing, or to play the guitar. “He was like my son,” she said. “My beloved nene.” His aunt, Yamilla Miranda, described him as a “funny kid.” “You expect a kid to run and to play and to be with the other kids,” she said, “but he was reading, and he loved to play video games, and there was his film — all day, making films.” Celebrity and Charity Image Mr. Miranda knows how to draw a crowd. In Jayuya, he announced a new philanthropic effort to help coffee growers whose crops were damaged by Hurricane Maria.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times It was mucky atop the mountain. Hurricane Maria had stripped the hillsides, and now it had been raining, so photographers were stumbling into the red mud as they scrambled to get photos of Mr. Miranda next to a newly planted coffee bush, Mr. Miranda with a ripening bean, Mr. Miranda beside executives from Starbucks and Nespresso and the Rockefeller Foundation, all pledging to help him help the island’s storm-battered coffee industry. He was witty, worrying aloud about the safety of a bush when a slip-sliding journalist reached out to steady himself. He was revealing, rolling up his jeans to show off a new coffee-cup tattoo on his ankle. He was sweating in his gray Puerto Rican scholarship fund T-shirt, but he turned on the charm — embracing farmers, thanking donors, listening attentively to discussion of fungus infestation and seed regulation. And he was relentlessly on message: Puerto Rico needs help. “A year ago, this island changed forever,” he said at the small family-owned coffee farm in Jayuya. “We’re going to have their backs.” “Hamilton” has given him both resources — he’s making millions of dollars a year — and renown — access to princes and presidents, magazine covers and movie deals. Mr. Miranda’s philanthropy, which he conducts in collaboration with his family, is still taking shape but is growing fast. Over the last two years, the Mirandas have given more than $4.6 million to nonprofits and have raised another $8 million, after expenses, through sweepstakes campaigns for a variety of causes, according to Sara Elisa Miller, the family’s director of philanthropy. Their interests are varied, including developing artists of color; encouraging political involvement by Latinos; and supporting voting rights, immigrants, women’s health and education. And in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which killed about 3,000 people and caused damage to the island’s infrastructure and economy, they have been especially focused on helping Puerto Rico. “It needs help, and it needs attention,” Mr. Miranda said, “and one of the weird side effects of ‘Hamilton’ is this megaphone that I didn’t really know what to do with in the beginning.” That megaphone means that Mr. Miranda is a signal booster, able to use his visibility and his huge social media following to call attention to issues and causes. After the hurricane, the Mirandas helped raised $43 million for the Hispanic Federation’s hurricane relief fund — an effort that was inadvertently boosted when Mr. Miranda, in an uncharacteristic outburst, said on Twitter that President Trump would go to hell for criticizing the San Juan mayor — and also helped with a toy drive that delivered 40,000 Three Kings’ Day gifts to Puerto Rican children. More recently, the family has turned to shoring up Puerto Rican artists, setting up a fund through the Flamboyan Foundation through which they hope to raise and distribute $15 million. That money is to come largely from the Puerto Rico “Hamilton” production, in part through the sale of premium tickets (about 3,000 at $5,000 apiece), corporate sponsorships, and any profits from the San Juan run. (There are also cheap tickets — 10,000 seats, about one-fourth of the total, are being sold for $10 each — and pricey tour packages.) Mr. Miranda is using the event to promote tourism, too. He lured Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show” to broadcast from Puerto Rico during the “Hamilton” run, with a promise that it will be a celebration of the island and its people. For Mr. Miranda, figuring out how his heritage would influence his art, and his activism, started early, and took some time. He grew up — in the words of Quiara Alegría Hudes, his co-author on “In the Heights” — “a Nuyorican hip-hop-raised whiz kid,” and has often described “code-switching” from an early age, as he shuttled between his predominantly Hispanic childhood neighborhood (Inwood) and the overwhelmingly white precincts surrounding his schools on the Upper East Side. (He attended Hunter elementary and high schools, public schools for gifted students.) Characters in the musicals he wrote in high school “would have Latino surnames, but there wasn’t anything particularly Latino about them,” he said. But at Wesleyan, he moved into La Casa de Albizu Campos, a house for Latino students named for a Puerto Rican nationalist, and honed his voice. “In that house, I really met other kids who were like me — who were first generation, very driven, but could speak to every side of pop culture — to Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin and J. Lo, along with the American culture we all grew up with,” he said. He started writing “In the Heights” as an undergraduate, and in 2008, the night he won a Tony Award for that show’s score, he rapped his acceptance speech and then, holding the statuette aloft in his left hand, reached into the pocket of his tuxedo, pulled out a small Puerto Rican flag and waved it in the air. “It’s a bat signal to your countrymen to say, ‘I’m up here, and you can be here too,’” he said. “In the Heights” established his career; “Hamilton” established his fame. He lives in Washington Heights, still rides the subway (and the bus), but, by his own acknowledgment, his life “has changed very dramatically.” Not that he’s complaining. “You’re not going to get any griping about being a celebrity from me,” he said. “Tommy Kail would probably say, ‘Lin was always this famous in his own mind, and the rest of the world caught up.’ And that’s not untrue.” Image Mr. Miranda’s father opened a small plaza in Vega Alta that includes a gift shop selling the composer-performer’s merchandise.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times He is a very busy man. He is starring in movies (“Mary Poppins Returns”) and television (“His Dark Materials”). He is directing (“Tick, Tick … Boom!”) and producing (“Fosse/Verdon”). He even published a book of collected tweets. A film adaptation of “In the Heights” is in development, and a live-capture filming of “Hamilton” is edited and sitting in a vault, waiting until the show’s producers feel the time is right for release. In January, immediately after the “Hamilton” run ends in Puerto Rico, he will help to present a run of “Freestyle Love Supreme,” the improvisational rap group he co-founded. (He will also appear occasionally as a guest star.) And, intriguingly, he said he is hoping to produce plays on Broadway. He’s also always writing. “I still have ideas for musicals — I don’t know whether they’re film musicals or stage musicals, but I’m just going to write them the way I wrote ‘Hamilton’ and see what they come out as,” he said. He declined to share the topics, but said, “I promise you history is nowhere near any of them. Every historian is throwing their books at me, and I’m doing none of those.” When I ask why he has so many projects, he dismisses the question with self-deprecation. “I am the laziest Miranda,” he said, “and the laziest Miranda still gets a lot done.” A Plan Turned Upside Down Image It takes a family: Luis Miranda, left, assisted his son during a visit to a University of Puerto Rico theater where they had hoped to stage “Hamilton.”CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times Mr. Miranda wheeled around, turning his back on the two dozen publicists and filmmakers and sponsors and well-wishers jockeying for a moment, a word, a selfie. He was standing in the theater at the University of Puerto Rico’s Río Piedras campus, where he expected to perform “Hamilton,” and just for a moment, he tuned them all out. He looked out beyond the lip of the stage, surveyed the repaired roof and the new rigging, took a deep breath, and aimed his voice beyond the orchestra and up into the balcony. “The world turned upside down” he bellowed across the cavernous, empty auditorium, testing an evocative “Hamilton” lyric. Impressed by what he was seeing, he delivered a satisfied assessment. “This’ll do.” But it wouldn’t. Image “Hamilton” spent $1 million toward repairing and upgrading the theater at the University of Puerto Rico’s Río Piedras campus before deciding to switch venues, citing security concerns.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times San Juan is not on the regular circuit for touring Broadway shows. It’s expensive and time-consuming to transport sets by boat, and the local economy is too weak to support long runs. But there was really never a question that “Hamilton” would come to Puerto Rico. “In the Heights” had played San Juan for a week in 2010, with Mr. Miranda, who had played the leading role on Broadway, jumping into the cast of the touring production so he could perform on the island that shaped him. “It was the most satisfying creative experience of my life,” he said. “It closed a circle I didn’t know was open — I didn’t realize how important it was to me that this island I love so much support my work.” So “Hamilton” would come, too. The run in Puerto Rico would kick off the sixth production of “Hamilton.” Mr. Miranda would play Alexander Hamilton only in San Juan; then when the rest of the cast heads to California for a long run in San Francisco, another actor would play the title character. Luis Miranda, a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico, was eager for “Hamilton” to play at his alma mater, hoping to burnish its reputation and show that its theater could host touring Broadway shows. But the university has long been a hotbed of protest — Luis Miranda himself participated in protests when he was a student — and in recent years, it has been convulsed by a budget crisis that has led to proposals for rising student fees and declining staff benefits. A union representing university staffers is at loggerheads with the administration, and late last month its leadership sent Mr. Miranda a letter warning that “large-scale conflict” could affect the musical production. At the same time, Mr. Miranda’s 2016 support for the controversial debt plan, known as Promesa, has made him a target for criticism from some Puerto Ricans. Last year, five students stormed the stage, shouting slogans, during a question-and-answer session with him on campus. “Lin-Manuel, our lives are not your theater,” read one of their handmade signs. “The only artists and people that benefit from ‘Hamilton’ are the elite, white North American settlers, the rich bourgeoise and those who actively participate and aspire to become oppressors,” said Ruth Figueroa, a student of comparative literature and one of the protesters. She was critical of Mr. Miranda’s stands on fiscal issues, worried that accommodating “Hamilton” would drain resources needed elsewhere and unimpressed by the choice of Alexander Hamilton as the subject for a biomusical by a Latino artist. “As a Latin person, he should be more conscious of who Hamilton was — he’s glorifying a person that represents oppression,” she said. “He could have made a show about Harriet Tubman.” Image “Lin-Manuel, our lives are not your theater” — Ruth Figueroa, in front of an unrepaired, storm-damaged building at the University of Puerto Rico. She was among a group of students who protested Mr. Miranda last year.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times Mr. Miranda, who now advocates debt forgiveness for Puerto Rico, said he understands the concerns about Promesa and had no problem with the protesters. “I believe the criticisms of everything that came after are valid, but I also, in that moment, didn’t see other options,” he said. I met with 14 theater and music students while visiting the university, and they expressed a swirl of conflicting emotions about “Hamilton” — enthusiasm for the artistry, gratitude for Mr. Miranda, but also resentment that “Hamilton” appeared to be showered with resources when their academic departments were being cut back, and disappointment that more of them were not given opportunities to work on the show. None of them expressed an intention to protest; all of them said they were hoping to see the show, and four were later offered unpaid internships with the production. The campus’s acting chancellor, Luis A. Ferrao, thought the concern about protest was overblown. “Anything that would have arisen could have been taken care of,” he said. “No one dies because someone yells or carries a sign against whatever.” But the Mirandas and the producers of “Hamilton” were rattled. Even though union leaders told Luis Miranda they would not protest during the production, the “Hamilton” team was not sure union members would follow suit, and there were rumblings of possible student action. Image Theater and music students at the University of Puerto Rico expressed a variety of emotions about “Hamilton” — admiration for the artistry, affection for Mr. Miranda, but also a wish that their own work got as much support from university officials.CreditChristopher Gregory for The New York Times There is also a longstanding practice in Puerto Rico restricting police access to college campuses, which created a concern about how long it would take to get law enforcement assistance if needed. “We all felt 99.99 percent sure that all we were going to get were protests, and that’s fine, but there’s always that .01 percent possibility that a handful of people escalate something, and that’s a risk we were not going to run,” Luis Miranda said. So on Dec. 21 — after the Flamboyan Arts Fund spent $1 million to repair the university theater’s storm-damaged roof and upgrade its systems, and “Hamilton” loaded in its set — the show’s lead producer announced that he was relocating the production to the Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferré, the San Juan theater where “In the Heights” had run. Students are stunned and upset. “I’m certainly in shock and deeply disappointed,” said Alondra Llompart. Then on Dec. 23, the presidents of student organizations at the university’s many campuses released a statement asking the production to reconsider. Mr. Miranda is left making peace with the contradictions — melding his pride in this place, and its pride in him, with the messy realities of a politically charged island that is struggling to recover from hurts both recent and historic. For the moment, he is far from the tumult. Having wrapped up promotional duties for “Mary Poppins Returns” that took him around the world, he has been practicing the “Hamilton” role in his Manhattan laundry room. “I have no agenda for Puerto Rico other than I want it to be proud of me,” he said. “All my efforts here are just to help the island in the best way I know how.” Follow Michael Paulson on Twitter: @MichaelPaulson.

Photographs by Simone Perolari Text by Ben Rothenberg June 4, 2018 PARIS — Roland Garros is the smallest of the four Grand Slam tennis venues, packed into a narrow wedge of parkland. Its 17 courts are fixed rectangular slabs, like the bricks that are crushed into dust to cover their surface. But unlike the grass at Wimbledon and the hardcourts in Melbourne, Australia, and Flushing Meadows, Queens, the dust at Roland Garros moves. With every gust of wind, bits of the court lift into the air and spread the terre battue beyond its intended confines, looking like a faint coat of rust. Image Some of the grounds of Roland Garros as seen from the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier on Wednesday. That pigment mixes with a collection of textures and characters around the grounds to form an ever-moving mosaic of sport and art; of energy and tranquillity; of foliage and fortification. Beneath the surface, hundreds of players buzz, their nervous energy bottled until it is uncorked onto an assigned court. Their equipment is temporary, though the best matches become indelible. Image Rafael Nadal warmed up with some tunnel jumps before a match on Tuesday. The Roland Garros complex is fanning outward, its courts and people pushing farther into the surrounding green spaces, carving into and coexisting with nature. New Court 18, which begins an incremental westward expansion, is sunken and arboreal. An iron perimeter is dotted with security personnel who placidly watch the life teeming around them. Their detachment is astonishing, because to be at Roland Garros is to become attached to it. Image A fan had his shirt signed by the Russian player Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Sunday. While the players wear what is dictated by their apparel sponsors, visitors find numerous forms of self-expression. Fans dress to match their spirit, representing their allegiances to the sport or their sense of place. Sometimes the two intermingle: One fan had his Mona Lisa T-shirt autographed by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, a Russian player whose own fluid artistry probably had never before been melded to Leonardo da Vinci’s. But at Roland Garros, everything blends into one. Image A wall in Court Philippe Chatrier stadium is full of the signatures of players who have played there.

By Gregory Cowles Dec. 7, 2018 MAD, BAD, DANGEROUS TO KNOW The Fathers of Wilde, Yeats and Joyce By Colm Toibin Illustrated. 253 pp. Scribner. $26. In the Scylla and Charybdis episode of “Ulysses,” set in the National Library in Dublin, Stephen Dedalus gets into a literary debate that wanders from Hamlet’s father to Shakespeare’s father to the thorny relationship between art and life — a rich subject in any context, but all the richer here, where the reader can confidently assume the life in question isn’t Shakespeare’s or even Stephen’s, but that of Joyce himself. “A father is a necessary evil,” Stephen asserts, riffing on the rivalries between fathers and sons. “What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.” Reading this, we skip in our minds from Hamlet to Shakespeare to the tensions between Stephen and Simon Dedalus, before setting the text aside to contemplate the relationship between the author and his own father, John Stanislaus Joyce. Colm Toibin travels a similar path in his new book, “Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know: The Fathers of Wilde, Yeats, and Joyce,” in which he offers capsule biographies of Sir William Wilde, John B. Yeats and John Stanislaus Joyce — three Dubliners who between them, in a span of under 30 years, sired three of the greatest writers the English language has ever known. Forget the book’s odd title, which pilfers from Lady Caroline Lamb’s description of Lord Byron (or, less probably, from a 1986 album by the pop group Dead or Alive), and which in any case doesn’t seem especially apt. Toibin presents an evocative, engaging portrait not only of “three prodigal fathers,” as he calls them, but of Dublin in the 19th and early 20th centuries as “a place of isolated individuals, its aura shapeless in some way, a place hidden from itself, mysterious and melancholy.” As that lovely description suggests, Toibin, who lives in Dublin and New York, is an impressive, graceful writer in his own right. A prolific novelist whose celebrated works of fiction include “The Master,” “Brooklyn” and “Nora Webster,” he moves nimbly in this book from biography to literary criticism to personal narrative, with glimpses of himself reciting Wilde’s “De Profundis” at the now-shuttered Reading Gaol, say, or browsing archives for Yeats’s letters. Mostly, though, the dads are the stars of the show. Toibin assumes readers will already be familiar with the sons’ work, and until the Joyce section (where it’s unavoidable) he doesn’t spend much time seeking connections between the work and the father-son relationships. Indeed, he doesn’t much elucidate the father-son relationships at all. Rather, he tries to capture the fathers’ distinct personalities and their social milieu, casting a light that readers might use to illuminate connections for themselves. Image He has plenty of material to work with. Take William Wilde: Even before he was knighted, in 1864, for work he performed on the Irish census, Oscar’s father was a prominent eye and ear surgeon in Dublin, the head of an ophthalmology hospital and a proud Irish nationalist (as was his wife) who nonetheless navigated the highest levels of English society. Toibin smartly notes that, against that backdrop, irony and inconstancy were political and social necessities for the Wildes, who in an unsettled time derived considerable strength from “the ambiguity of their position, … their ability to draw power from two opposite sides without having fully to obey a set of rules to which either of these two sides adhered.” The relevance to their son’s life and career, with its own ambiguities and slippery allegiances, is plain: “In the soirees that his parents gave,” Toibin notes, “the idea of loyalty, whether to the crown or to Victorian sexual mores, was never stable.” William Wilde had several children out of wedlock, and was once accused in a lawsuit of raping a patient under anesthesia — a case that strikingly presages Oscar’s own trial on sexual grounds three decades later, even if Toibin’s litany of the parallels starts to take on the feel of a parlor trick, like that list of supposed similarities linking Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. More instructive, perhaps, are the points of departure between father and son. One delightful detail about William Wilde to emerge here is that, in contrast to Oscar’s foppishness, Sir William was notably disheveled and dirty, unkempt. (Toibin cites a joke that W. B. Yeats remembered making the rounds in Dublin: “‘Why are Sir William Wilde’s nails so black?’ Answer: ‘Because he has scratched himself.’”) In this light Oscar Wilde’s sense of style can be seen as a reaction against his father’s legacy, as an effort to reverse it or leave it behind. “Having a father,” Toibin writes, in a line that will resonate with any 15-year-old boy, “might have seemed at certain moments quite unnecessary” for Wilde. John B. Yeats, too, provides Toibin a complicated and eccentric character study. A trained lawyer who abandoned the law to pursue his passion for painting, Yeats achieved some renown as an artist but sabotaged his ambitions through his paralyzing inability to finish what he started; a stranger, on meeting W. B. Yeats and learning who his father was, once remarked, “O, that is the painter who scrapes out every day what he painted the day before.” This is a fairly common affliction — among book reviewers as well as artists — but most people who suffer it find other ways to earn a living. Not Yeats. The financial prospects for a painter who finishes few paintings are somewhat dim, and he squandered a significant inheritance before decamping to London and eventually New York at the age of 68, seven years after his wife’s death. There he more or less continued to avoid painting and wrote long, fervent letters (to his children, to a love interest back in Dublin) that suggest he found it easier to be affectionate at a safe remove. That pattern recurs throughout Toibin’s account: “In this world of sons,” he writes later, in another beautiful sentence, “fathers become ghosts and shadows and fictions.” Toibin pointedly contrasts W. B. Yeats’s prolific output as a poet with his father’s scant record as an artist, and in an interesting digression says that a comparable dynamic affected Henry James (whom Toibin inhabited so memorably in “The Master”). “I was alert,” he writes, “to the similarities between the two families — the Jameses and the Yeatses — and the similar ways in which two famous sons had been influenced by their father.” Among those parallels is that the sons “specialized, unlike their fathers, perhaps in spite of their fathers, in finishing almost everything they started.” About Joyce’s father — an overbearing but underinvolved drunkard who abused his children before eventually abandoning them — Toibin has the least direct documentary material. Paradoxically, this section feels most alive as a result. After summarizing the basic biographical data, about John Stanislaus Joyce’s marriage and children and his difficulty holding a job, Toibin runs out of narrative momentum and is forced instead to explore the father’s psychological impact on his children. He plumbs a memoir and a diary by James Joyce’s brother Stanislaus, then turns at last to Joyce’s own writing to argue, persuasively, that the effort to understand and empathize with his father provided an abiding source of Joyce’s genius: “James Joyce,” he writes, “sought not only to memorialize his father but also to retrace his steps, enter his spirit, use what he needed from his father’s life to nourish his own art.” And again: “Joyce allowed a complex imagination to shine its pale, unsettled light on what had already passed into shade so that he could coax it back into substance, courtesy of style.” This is a thrilling reading that aptly unites Toibin’s novelistic gifts for psychology and emotional nuance with his talents as a reader and critic, in incomparably elegant prose. Of course, any Irish writer dealing with Wilde and Yeats and Joyce might be expected to struggle with some “daddy” issues himself along the way. (It’s worth noting, given the other personal detours Toibin indulges, that in a book devoted to writers’ fathers he nowhere mentions his own.) But as a biographer Toibin seems largely untroubled by the accomplishments of the three sons, neither competitive nor rebellious, despite some vestigial envy and ancestral pride that Wilde, Yeats and Joyce had the opportunity to define a national literature; in early-20th-century Dublin, he observes a little wistfully, “every writer had to invent a world as though from the very beginning.” The book unavoidably invites questions about the nature of the father-son bond — and then mostly avoids them. That’s to Toibin’s credit: The three fathers’ lives are so varied, and the sons’ work so different, that it’s hard to derive general conclusions about father-son relationships or their influence on art, and for the most part Toibin is too subtle and circumspect to try. Always an understated writer, who prefers innuendo to inflection, in this book he evinces a talent for the deadpan. (“Yeats even met the young James Joyce on the street,” he writes at one point. “Joyce found him ‘very loquacious.’”) Where Toibin does try to force conclusions, he stumbles uncharacteristically, as when he declares, “They created chaos, all three of these fathers, while their sons made work.” This is so broad as to be meaningless, and in any case doesn’t bear scrutiny — the sons might be said to have created plenty of chaos on their own, after all. Is it true, as Stephen Dedalus says, that a father’s legacy to his children is limited to an instant of blind rut? Sometimes, sure. But other times the connection is far deeper and more complicated, as Toibin’s wise and resonant book makes clear. However fraught the relationship, however competitive or controlling or cold, sometimes even an imperfect father gives his son wings and teaches him to fly.

Transcript Becomes an Offbeat Thriller Supported by Staging Reality Winner: An F.B.I. Transcript Becomes an Offbeat Thriller Image Tina Satter, right, is directing Emily Davis in “Is This a Room,” a play about the F.B.I.’s 2017 interrogation of the military contractor Reality Winner.CreditCreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times By Amanda Hess Dec. 30, 2018 Last December, the theater director Tina Satter was stuck at a desk, temping as a receptionist, when she fell down an internet rabbit hole. After reading the New York magazine profile of Reality Winner — the 20-something military contractor charged with leaking a single top-secret document about Russian election hacking — Ms. Satter clicked a link to a blog post about Ms. Winner’s pantyhose, and then another link to a grainy PDF of an official F.B.I. transcript. It recorded the moment in June 2017 when a fleet of federal agents entered Ms. Winner’s Georgia home, interrogated her and extracted a confession. Ms. Satter read the transcript online, but when she recalls it now, she makes the gesture of dramatically flipping pages in the air. “Immediately I thought, This is a play,” she said. “This is a thriller.” Reading the government document through the lens of a director, Ms. Satter saw a title printed across the top — “VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTION” — followed by a list of “participants,” or characters: Reality Winner, whose name alone feels theatrical; the two special agents who interrogated her that day; and a mysterious figure listed only as “Unknown Male.” The transcript was intriguing in its precision. Every stutter, sigh, and stray sound was noted. It was also jumping with subtext: Even as they circled Ms. Winner with an espionage charge, the F.B.I. agents made small talk about the weather, CrossFit and her cat. Everyone there was struggling to act casual in the least casual of circumstances. And then there was Ms. Winner herself, with whom Ms. Satter quickly grew fascinated. Ms. Winner is an Air Force veteran fluent in several Afghan languages. In 2017, she was 25 and working at a Georgia contractor complex, translating communications related to Iranian aerospace. She taught yoga for fun and scribbled on “pretty paper” at work. She tweeted insults about President Trump. She owned guns — pink guns. In the transcript, she toggles seamlessly between high-level intelligence language and jokes about her “resting bitch face.” Ms. Winner seemed to represent a new kind of figure. “I could totally relate to her dismay at living through America over the past two years, and her sort of pop response to it,” Ms. Satter said. “This is such a patriot of right now.” Image Surrounding Ms. Davis in rehearsal are members of the ensemble who play F.B.I. officers and others. From left: Becca Blackwell, T.L. Thompson and Pete Simpson.CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times She immediately sent the transcript to a collaborator, the actress Emily Davis, with the note: “You could play her.” Beginning January 4, Ms. Satter will direct Ms. Davis in “Is This a Room: Reality Winner Verbatim Transcription” at The Kitchen. Ms. Satter’s experimental theater company, Half Straddle, has never before taken on a real-life subject. The troupe rarely deals in realism. “Our plays,” Ms. Satter explained, “are usually these wholly made up worlds,” drawn from feminist, queer and adolescent subcultures. But Ms. Winner’s status as a young woman navigating an unfamiliar world connected it to other Half Straddle shows. Ms. Winner opens a window into a new kind of subculture: the banal office grind at the heart of the American security state, which has expanded so relentlessly that thousands of otherwise ordinary Americans have insight into classified material. Thanks to websites that surface the day’s “trending” classified “articles,” which Ms. Winner browsed while bored at work, even top-secret material begins to seem almost public. And while “Is This a Room” is on its face a re-enactment, there are elements of the transcript that pitch it into the surreal, and allow for interpretive space. Lines attributed to “Unknown Male” — dreamlike fragments of loose F.B.I. chatter picked up by the interrogators’ recorder — are all played on stage by Half Straddle company member Becca Blackwell. (The play’s title, “Is This a Room,” is one of them.) Swaths of the transcript are redacted in black, and in the weeks leading up to the premiere, Ms. Satter was still puzzling out how to dramatize them. On stage, the surreality will be punctuated by the disorienting sounds of Sanae Yamada, a musician who has written a synth-based score as well as a pop song about Ms. Winner called “Pretty Paper.” At a recent rehearsal at the Kitchen, Ms. Satter stalked around the bare set in a Mickey Mouse T-shirt, blocking the strange moment when the F.B.I. agents (played by Pete Simpson and T.L. Thompson) drum what sounds like a confession out of Ms. Winner, and then seamlessly return to discussing her cat, who is on a diet. (“Oh, she’s a big girl,” Unknown Male tells Ms. Winner.) Here the actors slowed their speech and tipped their bodies, giving the impression of a mind spinning, as the synth music closed in. Image Ms. Satter, rear at left, giving direction to Ms. Davis and Mr. Simpson.CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times And yet the play is grounded in the fact that this all really happened to a real person: a person who is in prison. (After pleading guilty to one felony count, Ms. Winner was sentenced to more than five years in August, the longest sentence ever imposed in federal court for such a leak.) The transcript itself was a crucial artifact in the legal proceedings. Her defense argued that the transcript, and its apparent confession, ought to be barred from court, as the F.B.I. never read Ms. Winner her Miranda rights or told her she was free to leave her home. But the government argued that the transcript proved that the agents had been so “exceedingly friendly” to Ms. Winner that she could not have been forced into talking. Staging the transcript felt like a way to reveal its hidden power dynamics. “There was so much happening right underneath the surface of the language,” said Ms. Davis. The actress shares both a physical resemblance to Ms. Winner and a South Texas background. She sees Ms. Winner as a “vibrant and sparkly person” who became isolated by her work for her country and ended up in a “lonely, vulnerable place.” And she is sensitive to the fact that in the play, she is moving about the world as Ms. Winner while Ms. Winner herself is locked away. Those sensitivities were heightened when Billie Winner-Davis, Reality’s mother, heard about the production and reached out. Image A snapshot of Reality Winner taken on the day of her arrest. Ms. Winner’s mother provided it to the production, and it has inspired an actress’s costuming. Ms. Satter and Ms. Davis have since been in close contact with her, and have exchanged letters with Reality herself. Both sides have approach the contents of the play gingerly; Ms. Satter has not asked Ms. Davis-Winner for insights into her daughter, and Ms. Davis-Winner has not inquired about the theatermakers’ process. (She will attend the first performance, with some trepidation: While she is eager for others to learn of her daughter’s story, “I don’t know whether I’ll be able to sit through it all,” she said.) She did assist in one way: She sent a photograph the F.B.I. took of Reality outside her home on the day she was arrested, which inspired Ms. Davis’s costume. In the photo, she’s leaning against a brick wall in jean shorts and canary-yellow Converse. Her hands are clasped politely in front of her and her eyes are turned down. It’s an image of Ms. Winner on the precipice between regular young woman and accused felon. She is outside in the Georgia sun, but the F.B.I. has her in its sights.

arts What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week  - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week Supported by What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week Helen Mirra’s complex weavings reverberate; Magalie Comeau’s monochromes have architectural allusions; and Jennifer Wynne Reeves’s work speaks in a voice shaped by Facebook. Image Helen Mirra's weavings, at Peter Freeman, are made on a hand loom, using linen and wool.CreditCreditvia Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris Helen Mirra Through Jan. 5. Peter Freeman, 140 Grand Street, Manhattan; 212-966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com. Helen Mirra’s marvelous SoHo show of small, vibrant weavings, evocatively titled “Bones Are Spaces,” rebalances the visual and intellectual elements of her work. For over two decades, this American artist has assiduously imbued her modest, low-lying sculptures and wall pieces — handmade from assorted found materials, dissected objects and, occasionally, borrowed texts — with complex reverberations of literature, history and philosophy. At times, these complexities have remained obscure unless clarified by the gallery’s news release, making the work feel hermetic and precious. The 24 weavings here were made on a hand loom over the last three years, using linen and wool and sometimes silk. They progress from pieces rarely more than 12 inches on a side, which are dominated by various shapes against contrasting backgrounds, to somewhat larger works in more muted yet sumptuous monochromes. In these, especially, the complexities are right on the surface: in subtle shifts in texture, tonality and the tightness of the weave; hints of shapes and grids; and other variations. All is in flux, depending on your distance from the works or where you place your attention. Everything about them conveys and invites considerable thought and concentration. The title’s reference to the intricate interiors of bones — which combine hollow and solid, hard and soft — seems apt. Ms. Mirra has often linked her work to her devotion to walking in nature, and the connection seems especially close here. Weaving is a linear activity with a cumulative effect. Ms. Mirra’s weavings can also be seen as reliefs, paintings and texts, especially those that teem with surface incident, including several from 2018 named for the months in which they were made. Perhaps most telling is the news release that has been, it says, “intentionally left blank.” To Ms. Mirra’s credit, we are on our own. ROBERTA SMITH Magalie Comeau Through Jan. 6. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 132 Delancey Street, second floor, Manhattan; 516-639-4918, mitchellalgusgallery.com. Image Magalie Comeau’s “Cachettes Votives aux Dimensions Insaisissables,” an 84-inch square in her show at Mitchell Algus, is hard to look away from.CreditMagalie Comeau and Mitchell Algus Gallery Magalie Comeau works slowly. Her paintings reveal themselves slowly, too. Each canvas in “New and Recent Paintings,” at Mitchell Algus Gallery, her first New York solo show and one of the few times she’s shown outside her native Quebec, is a black, white or rosy beige monochrome interrupted by a complication of intersecting shadows. Inside this complication there may be a stark figment of architecture. In “De la Profondeur du Lave-Temps de l’Horloge Hystérésique aux Champs de Mains,” it’s a tiny, uninhabited suburban interior. But this bit of bounded space serves mainly to emphasize the unbounded emptiness around it, adding a note of theatricality to the painting’s spacey transcendence. (Imagine an avant-garde monologue about death whose relentless focus is strangely soothing.) Even the pieces without such explicit figuration have auras of architectural allusion. Sharp-edged but shadowy zones of overlapping color evoke drywall, masking tape or slightly stuffy house paint samples. More broadly, the pieces also bring to mind the installations of the Light and Space movement — with the critical difference that, both because of the way they’re painted and simply because they’re paintings, they aren’t trying to determine every aspect of a visitor’s experience. Instead, they're waiting patiently to be fallen into. “Cachettes Votives aux Dimensions Insaisissables,” my own favorite, is an 84-inch-square black lozenge with a thick shaft of whites and grays pouring down just right of center. It’s hard to focus on but impossible to look away from. WILL HEINRICH Jennifer Wynne Reeves Through Feb. 3. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Manhattan; 212-219-2166, drawingcenter.org. Image The quirkiness of “Mondrian Guy and Expressonist Guy Take a Walk,” a 2005 gouache, is typical of Jennifer Wynne Reeves’s work, now at the Drawing Center.Creditvia the Drawing Center Most artists working with traditional materials use social media to plug their projects, risking promiscuous levels of self-promotion. A handful transcend this tendency, however, employing the same platforms toward creative, even visionary ends. Jennifer Wynne Reeves was one such artist. Living in a small town in the Delaware River Valley, she used Facebook as her connection to the larger art world, but also as her journal, studio, classroom and utopian forum. Her Facebook presence also helped secure her first institutional exhibition, “All Right for Now,” at the Drawing Center, four years after her untimely death from brain cancer. Ms. Reeves’s paintings, drawings and sketchbooks, in deep matte hues, are on view here; they are quirky and occasionally brilliant. Many of the works have an illustrative quality and include text that helps situate or explain them. “Mondrian Guy and Expressionist Guy” (2005) is a small gouache with two figures — a slab of straight lines and a cloud of squiggles — that suggest artistic attitudes as well as worldviews. “Swallow” (2013), a larger canvas with globs of pigment perched casually on its frame, includes a trompe l’oeil sheet of paper painted with a diaristic poem that ends with a swallow dipping into the Delaware River. Some of Ms. Reeves’s Facebook posts are reproduced in an accompanying catalog, giving you a sense of her voice, which was a bit like that of an Emily Dickinson for the internet age. “I believe in greatness,” she wrote in February 2014. “Great buildings survive earthquakes if their foundations sit on shock absorbers.” Greatness is relative, though, she argued, and we should all encourage one another toward it. Ms. Reeves’s own foundations, built on art and virtual community, have proved, even posthumously, to be extraordinarily sound. MARTHA SCHWENDENER ‘For Opacity’ Through Feb. 3. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Manhattan; 212-219-2166, drawingcenter.org. Image Elijah Burgher’s “Eden Flag With Solar-Anal Emblems,” in a show at the Drawing Center, features both overtly sexual symbols and mysterious ones.CreditElijah Burgher Western Exhibitions, Chicago Complex and colorful drawings by Toyin Ojih Odutola, Nathaniel Mary Quinn and Elijah Burgher make for an unusually rich show in “For Opacity,” curated by Claire Gilman at the Drawing Center. The show’s title is borrowed from a 1990 essay in which Édouard Glissant argues for the right of colonized or oppressed peoples to occupy space in Western society without explaining themselves. This type of politically charged “opacity” does come up in the work, but the concept raises an equally interesting question about the relationship of artwork to viewer: What do they owe each other? Mr. Burgher’s “Eden Flag With Solar-Anal Emblems and Hexes,” a colored-pencil conglomeration of graphic devices that suggests esoteric magic and queer desire, is charming in its evasiveness. Wondering about the specific significance of the symbols doesn’t prevent you from enjoying their overall effect. But several portraits of young men against backgrounds of similar symbols are more uncomfortable: The figures are so meticulously rendered that the ambiguity behind them makes you feel snubbed. Ms. Ojih Odutola’s use of black ink to draw white faces in half a dozen striking small works emphasizes the political weight of color without committing to a specific position. Her large charcoal and pastel portrait, “A Guarded Intimacy,” in which a watchful young man’s face is framed by walls, windows and a patterned sweater, demonstrates how a distant affect can express its own kind of vulnerability. Mr. Quinn takes this paradoxical performance of truth to a brilliant height with large multimedia drawings that look like collages. In “Elephant Feet,” an adult forehead, eyes and nose that look as if they were taken from torn photographs and a miniature but still oversize fur coat combine to form a defiantly heartbreaking figure whose patchwork composition is really a way of being whole.

arts Dana Carvey Remembers George Bush, From Muse to Friend - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|Dana Carvey Remembers George Bush, From Muse to Friend Supported by Dana Carvey Remembers George Bush, From Muse to Friend Image Dana Carvey brought his impersonation of President George H.W. Bush from “Saturday Night Live” to the White House in December 1992. The two remained friends.CreditCreditAssociated Press By Dana Carvey Dec. 7, 2018 Late on Nov. 8, 1988, the phone rang. I answered, and a familiar voice said: “Well, congratulations. You won.” “I won? What do you mean I won?” “Bush won, so you won,” he answered. “Jon?” “YES, it’s me! JON LOVITZ! And NOW YOU are going to be the president on ‘Saturday Night Live’ for the next four years. HAPPY NOW?” On “Saturday Night Live,” your friend’s defeat can be your victory. Comedians can be insanely competitive — the reason “class clown” is singular is because if there were two class clowns, one clown would ultimately kill the other clown. Jon had played the Democratic presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis, during the fall of 1988 opposite my George H.W. Bush impression. We both knew that if our guy were to win we would be in a lot of cold opens, a coveted spot to start the show for at least four years. I told Jon he had run a hard-fought campaign, and then I looked up at the TV to see that the real Michael Dukakis had just conceded to the real George H.W. Bush. The fake Dukakis had conceded to the fake Bush three minutes earlier. The George H.W. Bush conundrum President Ronald Reagan was an easy target. He had an impossibly low hairline, a tan, wrinkled face, a bobbling head, and as a bonus, he called his wife Mommy. He was comedy gold. On the other hand, the first President Bush was a comedian’s nightmare. There was nothing to do an impression of — no hook. My take on him, in the early sketches, was actually kind of terrible and not particularly funny. I always had good jokes with the help of two brilliant political satirists, Al Franken and Jim Downey, but my first Bush cold opens were just O.K. Then one late Friday night on the 17th floor of Rockefeller Center, as Franken and I sat in his office racking our brains, something unexpected happened. Lorne Michaels, the creator and executive producer of “S.N.L.,” had asked for a Bush cold open, and in comedy terms, “we had nothing.” I was playing around, trying to make Al laugh. At one point, I raised my right arm and began rotating my hand lazily with index finger pointed — as if the hand were reaching for some thought. And then it came out — my voice flattening in a lazy syntax — “those people out there … doing that thing … doing that thing in that whole area over there.” Al was laughing his ass off, and we both knew we had a hook. At that moment, President Bush became a character. In the ensuing months, a lot of sub-hooks and hand gestures were added. And ultimately, if President Bush said, “Not going to do it,” I said, “Na Ga Da It.” That’s actually how it was written on the cue card. I could tell you more, but it wouldn’t be prudent at this juncture. Lincoln Bedroom: Been there, done that On Dec. 4 1992, I was on the phone with Lovitz. Again. I heard a beep indicating call waiting. “Hold on a sec, Jon.” “This is White House operator No. 1. Please hold for the President.” “Sorry Jon, I got to take this call.” “What? You got a BIGGER name on the other line?!” “Yes.” Suddenly I’m on the phone with President Bush, who had lost his bid for re-election the month before. I’m more than a bit nervous. “How ya doing, Dana?” “Doing fine, thanks, Mr. President” “Well Dana, wondering if you would consider coming out to the White House and help cheer up the staff. Folks are a little down. Could use a laugh.” Wow, I thought to myself. I make fun of him for years, he loses the election, and now he wants me to come to Washington and cheer up the staff? I was caught off guard, and the first thing that popped out of my mouth was, “Well, uh, where would I stay?” It felt stupid as soon as I said it. I had just asked the president of the United States to book a hotel for me. There was a long pause. Then, “Well, you could, uh, stay right here in the White House, with Bar and me.” Two weeks later my wife, Paula, and I put our luggage down in the Lincoln Bedroom. (Dear reader: At this point you are probably thinking: Lincoln Bedroom, wow! Is it gorgeous? Yes. Is it awe-inspiring? Yes. Did my wife and I make love in the Lincoln Bedroom? I’m not going to say, but my son’s middle name is ABE.) Soon we were sitting in a beautiful living room. I was in my one and only suit, drinking a beer. Across from us, the President and Mrs. Bush, and another couple who were longtime friends, were having cocktails. There was a bit of awkward small talk, then the president said, “You know, Dana, I never thought your impression of me was nasty — never hit below the belt.” I smiled and nodded. That was nice to hear. Then: “Hey Dana, why don’t you do that impression you do of me for everybody right here, right now.” I froze. Suddenly my impression seemed like a grotesque representation of the actual man. “Uh, it’s not very good … uh, it doesn’t really sound like you … it’s just a weird voice … like John Wayne trying to do Mister Rogers.” The president smiled, index fingers raised. “Don’t tell me you’re NA GA DA IT.” I started to sweat. I chugged the rest of my beer. “Got an idea!” the president said. “Secret Service guy right outside the door. His name is Brian — why don’t you use my voice and see if you can trick him into thinking it’s me.” Everybody stared at me in anticipation. So I did it. “HEY BRIAN, I KNOW YOU’RE DOING THAT SECRET SERVICE THING, BUT CAN YOU COME IN HERE FOR A SECOND!” The agent opened the door and leaned his head, looking slightly confused. “Its O.K., Brian, just having a little fun!” the president said. (Dear Reader, everything you’ve just read is true but the quotes may not be word-for-word accurate. I didn’t have a tape recorder. I have one now.) The next day I met with the president in the Oval Office with his advisers. The plan was that the staff would be assembled in the East Wing, “Hail to the Chief” would play, and I would come out as George Bush to the surprise and delight of everyone. So there I was, hidden off to the side of the room, which was packed. I was nervous. They loved the president. How would they react to me? “Hail to the Chief” began playing, I emerged from the alcove and started doing Bush making a Santa’s list. “Love socks, stripy socks, also would love a pumpkin-colored tie — very festive, very pumpkiny.” Trust me, it’s killing, and I could see the president laughing really hard. I pulled out all the stops — “NA GA DA IT,” “wouldn’t be prudent,” “Santa doing that thing he does in that whole area over there.” Eventually the real Bush came up, and he did me doing him in front of me, and then I did him doing me in front of him. Paula and Barbara were behind us laughing. But there was definitely a sense of melancholy in the air. A new administration was coming in, and a lot of these people would be saying goodbye very soon. The president, being who he was, was only thinking about others. I was just relieved it all worked out. A friendship begins Later that day, my wife and I accompanied the president and the first lady to the Kennedy Center, where outstanding artists were awarded for their contributions to the arts. (Another generous gesture from the president — my work was done, but we were still hanging out.) The recipients that year included Lionel Hampton, Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman. We settled into our box seats high up in the theater, and I noticed that all four of us had a Secret Service agent seated behind us. I asked Barbara Bush about it, and she said that it was standard protocol since, “you know, Lincoln.” During a break in the show, I happened upon Newman, who had apparently referred to Vice President Dan Quayle in some derogatory manner in the press. “I’m trying to avoid him,” he said. “He knows I think he’s a moron.” Just then Quayle approached, and Paul skedaddled back to his seat. Just as the show ended, Walter Cronkite, the host, looked up to the balcony where we all were sitting and, in his booming voice, congratulated President Bush “on behalf of a grateful nation” for his 50 years of public service. Then the entire audience stood up, faced us and gave him a loud, lengthy ovation. It seemed to catch the president off guard. The Secret Service whisked us away to a small elevator, and I looked up to see the president with tears running down his cheeks. No one said a word. My wife and I had known the Bushes for only 30 hours, and there we were, sharing this intimate family moment. And so began my lucky 25-year friendship with “Barbara and George.” My wife and I happily received Christmas cards every year, as well as other postcards and letters. When I had a health scare in 1998, President Bush wrote to me to ask: “Can I do anything Dana? We’ve got great doctors right here in Houston.” When we did charity events together, I did my Ross Perot impression for him, and he would always laugh. On Election Day in 2004, I got a surprise call. Again, the voice was familiar. “Hi, Dana. George Bush here. How ya doing?” “Hi, Mr. President. Uh, isn’t your son running for re-election today?” “Yeah. But how are you doing?” “I’m fine thanks. How’s the election looking?” “Don’t know yet. But Bar and I saw you on some ‘S.N.L.’ reruns last night and wondered how you were doing.” That was who he was. Always making sure everybody else was O.K. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Fake Bush Recalls A Real One.

arts How ‘Chappelle’s Show’ and ‘The Boondocks’ Kept Us Laughing at R. Kelly - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|How ‘Chappelle’s Show’ and ‘The Boondocks’ Kept Us Laughing at R. Kelly Supported by Critic’s Notebook How ‘Chappelle’s Show’ and ‘The Boondocks’ Kept Us Laughing at R. Kelly Image The singer R. Kelly is the subject of a six-part documentary on Lifetime, “Surviving R. Kelly.”CreditCreditMike Pont/Getty Images By Aisha Harris Jan. 6, 2019 “Surviving R. Kelly,” the six-part documentary about the R&B singer Robert Kelly, who has faced accusations of child and sexual abuse for decades, underscores the theme of accountability — not just of Kelly or his many personal enablers, but of us all. Clinical psychologists, music journalists, activists and others who are interviewed in this Lifetime series echo one another in their explanations of how the musician has managed to escape severe repercussions, legally and professionally, for decades. Chief among them: the shielding powers of money and fame; society’s indifference toward the suffering of black and brown girls and women; a perception by some that the attacks on any black male celebrity, no matter how credible, are part of a larger racist conspiracy. Another key factor: Laughter. Two cultural touchstones that helped shape the public’s perception of the Kelly accusations are only mentioned in passing in “Surviving R. Kelly.” But “(I Wanna) Pee on You,” a 2003 sketch from “Chappelle’s Show,” and a 2005 episode of the animated series “The Boondocks” titled “The Trial of R. Kelly,” embody many of the points made in the documentary. Revisiting them in light of “Surviving R. Kelly” demonstrates how, for years, those who laughed at Kelly were able to ignore the charges against him. It also emphasizes how much the cultural climate has shifted in the era of #MuteRKelly protests, and how much it has stayed the same. (Kelly, who was acquitted in 2008 on charges of child pornography, has denied all allegations related to abuse of and sex with minors.) In his sketch, the comedian Dave Chappelle took a straightforwardly silly approach to the allegations concerning a sex tape that appeared to show Kelly urinating on a 14-year-old girl. Dressed not unlike Kelly, in a pair of dark sunglasses and a bandanna, Chappelle stars in a music video in which he sings about wanting to urinate on the object of his affections. (“Your body is a porta potty.”) The melody aligns closely with Kelly’s song “Feelin’ on Yo Booty,” which is itself a rather preposterous song. (Kelly finds several comical ways to ad-lib the word “booty” at the end.) The set is bare bones in comparison to a typical Kelly video; most of it takes place in front of a long white curtain, as Chappelle sprays a garden hose — which is very explicitly labeled “R. Kelly’s urine” — on an ensemble of gyrating women. That’s an important distinction to make: The actors here are very obviously adult women, not pubescent girls. “(I Wanna) Pee on You” compartmentalizes the Kelly allegations and completely divorces it from its insidious facts; it’s easier (and safer) to poke fun at a grown man’s fetish than to wrestle with claims that he performed his fetish on a minor. (The Detroit Free Press reported that Chappelle, among other celebrities, declined to be interviewed for the documentary series.) “The Trial of R. Kelly” is the second episode of “The Boondocks,” which centered on the misadventures of the socially conscious 10-year-old Huey and his more brazen, politically incorrect little brother Riley, both voiced by Regina King. The creator Aaron McGruder pulled no punches. With the singer’s highly publicized trial happening close to home, the boys head to Chicago to witness the circus, Riley carrying a “Free R. Kelly” sign. When they encounter their nerdy neighbor Tom DuBois, who is representing the prosecution against Kelly, Riley lets loose an impassioned — and ridiculous — defense of the singer. Tom, shocked, counters that the alleged victim, depicted in the episode with pigtails and knee socks, is a little girl. Riley is having none of it. “I’ve seen that girl! She ain’t little; I’m little. Gary Coleman’s little.” He argues for “personal responsibility,” suggests that the girl should have just moved out of the way of Kelly’s urine and adds that he doesn’t want to “miss out on the next R. Kelly album,” should Kelly be sent to jail. “Boondocks” depicts Riley’s rhetoric as poisonous and the trial as a scathing farce. In the episode, Kelly’s white defense lawyer jumps through absurdist hoops to prove to the predominantly black jury that Kelly is a victim of racism. (He presents Kelly’s N.A.A.C.P. Image Award as evidence, and tells the jury, “They don’t want R. Kelly to be free because they don’t want you to be free!”) By the end of the episode, Huey, the moral voice of reason, is standing up in the courtroom, admonishing the jurors and everyone else in attendance for giving Kelly a pass because he made good music. Every black person who is arrested “ain’t Nelson Mandela,” he scolds. Later, in voice over narration, he laments that “ignorance won” and he is “vexed at my people.” As a scathing critique of Kelly’s deeds and black people’s complicity, unlike the Chappelle sketch, this episode still feels fresh, mostly. (Just look at comments on social media blaming the alleged victims in response to “Surviving R. Kelly.”) But McGruder’s stark delineation between Kelly’s supporters and dissenters plays into ugly stereotypes around class: Outside the courtroom, a loud, overweight black woman snacks on fried chicken while voicing her love for the singer; and three male protesters in suits are referred to by a news reporter as “scholars, activists, pillars of the African-American community.” (One of them looks just like Cornel West.) In reality, black people of all demographics have supported Kelly. As noted in the documentary, the same day he pleaded not guilty to the child sex tape charge, he went to a church event in Chicago, where he performed alongside children, and was embraced by the congregation there. McGruder overstepped the theme of “we are all responsible” by including the 14-year-old victim in his courtroom scene. (In the real trial, the girl identified as the alleged victim denied it was her in the video.) In the episode, the girl’s testimony echoes Riley’s earlier argument to Tom: “If I didn’t want to get peed on, I’d just move out the way,” she says with an attitude. It’s hard to imagine this episode airing today and not inspiring backlash. It’s also entirely possible that McGruder wouldn’t make this same creative choice today. But back when Kelly was still a consistent hit maker, the Chappelle sketch and this “Boondocks” episode were really funny. I can recall laughing about the skit with my friends in college, gleefully reciting lines like “Drip drip drip, pee on you.” I’m sure I chuckled the first time I heard the sassy black victim proclaim she’s not a victim on the stand. Even before the allegations, which I didn’t pay much attention to at the time, I was never much of a Kelly fan — I imagine “I Believe I Can Fly” is playing on loop somewhere in The Bad Place — but I did find him to be an excellent punch line for a long time. Now, however, it’s impossible for me to watch those episodes and not think about the magnitude of everything Kelly has been accused of. In the fourth episode of “Surviving R. Kelly,” the music journalist Ann Powers suggests that “Trapped in the Closet,” Kelly’s bonkers episodic soap operetta, was a strategic career move. “I think at some point he probably figured out that playing sex for laughs was a way that he could continue to avoid absolute condemnation for what he might have been doing behind the scenes,” she observes. It’s hard to argue with this point — even now some have found humor in “Surviving R. Kelly,” roasting him for his rumored inability to read or write. Looking back on “Chappelle’s Show” and “Boondocks,” it’s clear that there was more than one way to let Kelly off the hook, and comedy was one of them. Even if I was never defending Kelly, I was still laughing at him, and effectively ignoring his alleged transgressions. Related Coverage ‘Surviving R.

arts Back to the Bayou: James Lee Burke’s Latest Novel - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Back to the Bayou: James Lee Burke’s Latest Novel Supported by Crime Back to the Bayou: James Lee Burke’s Latest Novel Image CreditCreditPablo Amargo By Marilyn Stasio Jan. 4, 2019 Trouble comes calling on the Louisiana bayou parish where James Lee Burke sets his idiosyncratic regional novels. In THE NEW IBERIA BLUES (Simon & Schuster, $27.99), a condemned murderer named Hugo Tillinger has pulled off a daring escape from a Texas prison and is now hiding somewhere in his old neighborhood. Another recent arrival, the Hollywood director Desmond Cormier, has returned to his humble native roots to make a movie, installing himself and his entourage in a swell house with a spectacular view of the bay. From that vantage, Dave Robicheaux, the broody sheriff’s deputy who has stamped his forceful personality on this series, lays eyes on yet another visitor — a woman nailed to a large wooden cross that washes up from the bay. The dead woman, the daughter of a local minister, volunteered for the Innocence Project and was working to free Tillinger from prison. But while there seems to have been a real connection between the minister’s daughter and the escaped prisoner, Burke must exert himself to fit those Hollywood types into his brutal byzantine plot. (I stopped counting after the 10th violent death.) But does anyone really read Burke expecting a coherent narrative? We’re hanging on for Robicheaux’s pensées, like his meditation on the living spirits of the dead: “I don’t believe that time is sequential. I believe the world belongs to the dead as well as the unborn.” We’re keeping an eye out for vivid characters like Bella Delahoussaye, a blues singer with intimate knowledge of Big Mama Thornton’s mournful “Ball and Chain.” Maybe most of all, we’re waiting for those angry outbursts when Robicheaux lets it rip: “I don’t think you get it,” he tells one of the movie people. “Louisiana is America’s answer to Guatemala. Our legal system is a joke. Our legislature is a mental asylum. How’d you like to spend a few days in our parish prison?” Only if there’s a new James Lee Burke novel in the cell. ♦ “There was esoteric knowledge involved in being a burglar,” Thomas Perry advises us in THE BURGLAR (Mysterious Press, $26). It takes considerable expertise to select the right house, break in without waking the dog and recognize what’s worth stealing. Elle Stowell has been at this profession since she was 15, but this petite, lithe young pro isn’t prepared to find three people — all naked and shot between the eyes — piled in a heap on the king-size bed in the master suite of the house in Bel-Air she’s broken into. The protagonists of Perry’s ingenious thrillers are usually skilled at devising schemes for getting out of awkward situations. Elle uses her wits to break into tight spots, like the headquarters of the shady security firm hunting her down for involving herself in the triple homicide. Elle performs tricky feats here, but her pièces de résistance are the elaborate strategies she engineers to break into that company’s control center. If Perry is the king of obsessive strategists (and I so declare him), Elle is his pinup model. ♦ The thing is, Serge A. Storms is nuts; nonetheless, that doesn’t stop Tim Dorsey’s psycho hero from doing great deeds. While gripped in his never-ending quest to write an oral history of his beloved Florida, Serge manages to violently dispatch profiteers who menace the innocent and unwary. NO SUNSCREEN FOR THE DEAD (Morrow/HarperCollins, $26.99) finds Serge on a mission to rescue retirees from the hucksters who prey on them. “They have absolutely no soul,” he rages, after viewing one gullible couple’s junk-filled home. “They will sell and sell and sell until you either lose your house or call the cops.” With Coleman, his perpetually stoned companion at his side, Serge storms into Boca Shores, a retirement community of nice people who need his help. After snuffing out an abusive caretaker, he’s honored with a raucous pool party, a tribute he repays by treating everyone to a rollicking road trip we’d love to sign up for. ♦ August Octavio Snow is a big Detroit booster. In LIVES LAID AWAY (Soho Crime, $26.95), Stephen Mack Jones picks up his gung-ho protagonist where the author left him in his first novel, “August Snow” — cleaning up his beat-up neighborhood in Mexicantown. Using the millions awarded from his successful case against the Police Department, this ex-cop has already rescued his childhood home and is now renovating the other houses on his street. Snow thinks his old job is safely behind him — until a girl in a Marie Antoinette costume is tossed off the Ambassador Bridge. The victim is 19-year-old Isadora (Izzy) Rosalita del Torres, an undocumented worker who went missing in a government raid, and her battered body indicates she was being exploited by sex traffickers. Snow swings into action-hero mode and recruits a posse of friends and neighbors for a vigilante mission that dovetails with his crusade against ICE raids. Seeing Detroit through Snow’s adoring eyes is sweet. But except for the bad guys, who go out in a blazing gun battle, the characters are too good to be true, from Snow’s sainted godmother and a priest who operates an underground railroad to Snow himself, who could use a few flaws to make him human.

Sandra Oh was onstage a lot on Sunday. Not only was she one of the hosts, she also won her second Golden Globe — this time for best actress in a television drama as the star of the BBC series, “Killing Eve.” Her first win was in 2006: best supporting actress for her role as Dr. Yang on the television series “Grey’s Anatomy.” Other stars have won Globes even as they served as host, most recently Amy Poehler for best actress for “Parks and Recreation” in 2014. On Sunday Oh’s acceptance speech was one of the most spirited of the night, in keeping with her approach to her hosting duties: an endearing combination of earnestness and jubilation. When she took the stage, the camera cut to the audience, where her father was giving her a standing ovation, to which Oh yelled, “Oh, Daddy!” She also thanked “Killing Eve’s” creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge; Luke Jennings, author of the “Villanelle” novels on which the show is based; and the cast. “I’m so grateful, I’m so grateful to my family,” she said, and concluded later, “But mostly there are two people here tonight that I am so grateful that they are here with me. I’d like to thank my mother and my father. Thank you, everyone. When she finished her speech, Oh bowed toward her parents. Here’s the full list of winners.

Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater. Previews & Openings ‘MAESTRO’ at the Duke on 42nd Street (previews start on Jan. 3; opens on Jan. 14). Raise a baton to the Ensemble for the Romantic Century’s tribute to Arturo Toscanini. John Noble (“The Lord of the Rings,” “The Substance of Fire”) stars in Eve Wolf’s drama, which focuses on Toscanini’s antifascist activities and is scored to music by his contemporaries. Will it be, like Toscanini, pitch perfect? 646-223-3010, dukeon42.org UNDER THE RADAR at various locations (performances start on Jan. 3). Myths, monsters, punk rock and Anton Chekhov collide at this hallowed festival of performance and experiment. American favorites like Manual Cinema, Rude Mechs and New Saloon join international artists from Nigeria, Argentina and Norway. Highlights include Lola Arias’s exploration of the Falkland Islands conflict, “Minefield,” and Tania El Khoury’s “As Far as My Fingertips Take Me,” an encounter with a refugee. 212-967-7555, undertheradarfestival.com Last Chance ‘ALL IS CALM: THE CHRISTMAS TRUCE OF 1914’ at the Sheen Center (closes on Dec. 30). Do you hear what I hear? Theater Latté Da’s documentary musical, about the Christmas carols that emanated from World War I trenches, is finishing its song. The depiction of the war itself is somewhat sanitized, but the 10 men are in excellent voice, and when they come together, the sensation is tremendous and the musical chill effect engulfing. 866-811-4111, sheencenter.org ‘THE HARD PROBLEM’ at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center Theater (closes on Jan. 6). Tom Stoppard’s play, a drama of conscience, consciousness and coincidence, reaches its conclusion. Ben Brantley wrote that even though this production, directed by Jack O’Brien and starring Adelaide Clemens, is as cerebral as anything Stoppard has produced, it “often feels like the work of a precocious young neophyte rather than an old master” and “has yet to solve itself.” 212-239-6200, lct.org ‘HEAD OVER HEELS’ at the Hudson Theater (closes on Jan. 6). This Go-Gos jukebox musical has the beat, but not for much longer. Inspired by Sir Philip Sidney’s Renaissance lyric poem “The Arcadia,” the show, directed by Michael Mayer, is awash in cross-dressing and mistaken identity. Despite its wild premise, Ben Brantley wrote that the musical “mutters deferentially when what you want is a rebel yell.” 855-801-5876, thehudsonbroadway.com ‘ONCE ON THIS ISLAND’ at Circle in the Square Theater (closes on Jan. 6). A story of poignant self-sacrifice and occasional goats, Michael Arden’s revival of Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty’s musical, set in the French Antilles, floats away. Jesse Green called it “ravishing,” adding that Arden’s “staging serves his top-to-bottom terrific cast of black and Hispanic and Asian actors beautifully.” 212-239-6200, onceonthisisland.com ‘TORCH SONG’ at Second Stage at the Hayes Theater (closes on Jan. 6). The Broadway revival of Harvey Fierstein’s play, directed by Moisés Kaufman, douses its flame. Ben Brantley had particular praise for Mercedes Ruehl’s “expertly coiled performance” and for the show’s star, Michael Urie, who gives, he wrote, “a seriously entertaining interpretation of living large as a proactive defense against feeling small.” 212-239-6200, torchsongbroadway.com A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C21 of the New York edition with the headline: Theater.

arts This Week in Arts: Roy Hargrove, Caleb Teicher, Prototype Festival - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Arts Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Arts|This Week in Arts: Roy Hargrove, Caleb Teicher, Prototype Festival Supported by This Week in Arts: Roy Hargrove, Caleb Teicher, Prototype Festival The virtuoso trumpeter, who died last year, will be honored at two venues. By The New York Times Jan. 4, 2019 Image Roy HargroveCreditMylan Cannon/The New York Times Pop Music: Honoring the Late Trumpeter Roy Hargrove Jan. 8 and 12; jazz.org, winterjazzfest.com. As a part of what’s been called jazz’s “neoclassical” period, the virtuoso trumpeter Roy Hargrove won acclaim as a formidable standards improvisor in the hard-bop mode. But while Hargrove, who died at age 49 late last year, remained deeply rooted in jazz, he also anticipated the contemporary landscape of blurred musical genres, through his leadership of the electroacoustic ensemble the RH Factor and collaborations with D’Angelo, Erykah Badu and Common. Fittingly, given this dual legacy, the trumpeter’s contributions are being honored both uptown and down. On Tuesday, more than 40 artists will celebrate his life during a star-studded free concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center. And on Saturday, the Roots’ James Poyser will lead a tribute at Bowery Ballroom as part of the Winter Jazzfest marathon that will also feature the vocalist Bilal, as well as members of Hargrove’s quintet. NATALIE WEINER Dance: Caleb Teicher Makes Noise at the Guggenheim Jan. 6-7, worksandprocess.org. The tap dancer and choreographer Caleb Teicher is on a roll. His exuberant “Bzzz,” a sonically sophisticated collaboration with the beat boxer Chris Celiz, was a hit at New York City Center’s Fall for Dance festival in October. And his latest work, “More Forever,” drew critical acclaim after its recent preview at the Guggenheim Museum’s Works & Process series. Created with the pianist and composer Conrad Tao, “More Forever” now returns to the Guggenheim for its official premiere. With his free-spirited warmth and impeccable rhythm, Teicher first garnered attention as a dancer with the celebrated tap artist Michelle Dorrance. In works for his own ensemble, Caleb Teicher & Co., he shares her knack for percussive invention and moving bodies through space in eye-catching ways. To Tao’s score for piano and electronics, “More Forever” experiments with sources of sound, exploring American dance traditions like tap, jazz and Lindy Hop on a sand-covered stage. SIOBHAN BURKE Classical: Experimental Opera at the Prototype Festival Jan. 6-12; prototypefestival.org. The Prototype Festival, held each January, is a proving ground for audacious new opera and music theater. Overseen by Beth Morrison Projects and the theater collective Here, the 12 works put on by Prototype this week unfold across New York and explore themes as varied as clinical depression, family ties, capital punishment and the legacy of Pancho Villa. Among such intense offerings, one highlight is “prism,” composed by Ellen Reid, with a libretto by Roxie Perkins and direction by James Darrah. Staged at La MaMa in Manhattan, “prism” is Reid’s first opera, but her well-wrought music has been engaging with smart dramatic ideas for some time: She wrote a few of the most compelling scenes in “Hopscotch,” the car-based experimental opera that sprawled across Los Angeles in 2015. When “prism,” a harrowing examination of the aftermath of sexual assault, debuted last November, The Los Angeles Times declared that “Reid, in a word, has arrived.” WILLIAM ROBIN TV: ‘Fosters’ Sisters Grow Up in ‘Good Trouble’ Jan. 8; freeform.com. Freeform knows that a girl’s got to take flight sometime. The network welcomed Yara Shahidi into its world with “grown-ish,” which followed her character, the too-cool-for-school Zoey Johnson from ABC’s “black-ish,” as she stumbled through life as a college freshman. (Season 2, in which Zoey is determined to make her sophomore “sequel” better, began Jan. 2.) Now Freeform is spinning off two characters of its own: Callie (Maia Mitchell) and Mariana (Cierra Ramirez), part of the adopted clan at the heart of “The Fosters,” which ended in June (and offered a glimpse of the future with a series of flash-forwards). Their new series, “Good Trouble,” starting Tuesday, Jan. 8, picks up five years later in Los Angeles, where Callie, a recent law-school graduate, is clerking for a conservative judge, and Mariana has entered the male-dominated tech world. Together, they’ve landed the kind of dilapidated apartment with fabulous bones known only to first-time renters in Televisionland. Which could mean roommates. The more, the un-merrier. Like “The Fosters,” “Good Trouble” comes from Jennifer Lopez’s Nuyorican production company. And Jon M. Chu (“Crazy Rich Asians”) directed the pilot. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Image “Stag Amidst Autumn Flowers”CreditMori Sosen/The Metropolitan Museum of Art Art: Nature and Experimentation in Japanese Painting Through Jan. 21; metmuseum.org. Between the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and the 1868 Meiji Restoration, Japan was unified and at peace under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Popular arts flourished, and, though the country was officially closed for most of the period, foreign influences did trickle in. “The Poetry of Nature: Edo Paintings from the Fishbein-Bender Collection,” which you can catch for just a few more weeks at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, offers two ink paintings by Mori Sosen that are inflected with Western anatomical realism to mesmerizing effect. Ghostly black and white feathers in “Silkies” make seven chickens look as if they’re trembling, and the evanescent “Stag Amidst Autumn Flowers” is a delicate creature pinned in place by pointy leaves. WILL HEINRICH Image Marin Ireland CreditFrederick M. Brown/Getty Images Theater: Justified Female Fury in ‘Blue Ridge’ Through Jan. 26, atlantictheater.org. Cathartic though it was, taking an ax to the principal’s car was not the wisest expression of rage. But it’s the one that Alison chose, and in the sprawling new play “Blue Ridge” — written by Abby Rosebrock (“Dido of Idaho”) and directed by Taibi Magar (“Is God Is”) — her violence has landed her in a halfway house somewhere in southern Appalachia. Played by Marin Ireland, a masterly portrayer of tough and troubled women (“Ironbound,” “Kill Floor”), Alison is a likable mess of an English teacher trying to piece her life back together. Her destructive romance with the principal, her boss, endowed her with a sharply tuned radar for exploitative men, and she has zero tolerance when she senses a predator in the group home. A tragicomic ensemble piece that makes some vivid insights into sexual degradation, calculated abuse of power and justified female fury, “Blue Ridge” is in previews for an opening on Monday, Jan. 7, at Atlantic Theater Company in Manhattan. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Image “Grave of the Fireflies”CreditShinchosha Company Film: A Takahata Masterpiece Debuts in New York Jan. 4; quadcinema.com. In 1985, the Japanese filmmakers Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki founded the now-iconic Studio Ghibli, creating dreamy fairy tales like “Ponyo,” “Princess Mononoke” and “Spirited Away,” the last of which won an Oscar for best animated feature in 2003 after Disney released an English version. Miyazaki, who wrote and directed each of those films, grew to international acclaim. But the less prolific of the two, Takahata, who died in April, claimed his own legion of admirers with “Grave of the Fireflies” (1988). Its animation innocent (the light from those fireflies!) and message heart-rending, the haunting tale — based on a semi-autobiographical story by Akiyuki Nosaka — follows a teenage boy and his younger sister as they try to survive the firebombing of Japan by American forces during World War II. On Friday, Jan. 4, the Quad Cinema is giving Takahata’s masterpiece its New York theatrical premiere. Those unable to savor the experience on the big screen can find “Grave of the Fireflies” on iTunes.

arts ‘Aquaman’ Leads the Box Office Into the New Year - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Movies Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Movies|‘Aquaman’ Leads the Box Office Into the New Year Supported by ‘Aquaman’ Leads the Box Office Into the New Year Image Jason Momoa in his element in “Aquaman,” the box office leader.CreditCreditJasin Boland/Warner Bros By Gabe Cohn Jan. 6, 2019 There’s always a bigger fish — unless you’re “Aquaman.” The Warner Bros. DC Comics movie starring Jason Momoa continued to lead ticket sales this weekend, taking in an estimated $30.7 million at the end of a lazy week at the box office. The movie, now in its third week in theaters, put a triumphant cap on Hollywood’s 2018 box office comeback. And it has continued to do well overseas, where it brought in $56.2 million this weekend according to the studio. Combined with its cumulative domestic sales, that brings the movie’s total global ticket sales to about $940.7 million, meaning it could soon surpass $1 billion. But while the staying power of “Aquaman” at the top spot points to the film’s continued success, it also points to the fact that there simply isn’t much competition during Hollywood’s post-holiday exhale. The only new movie in the top 10 this week, Sony’s “Escape Room,” exceeded most analysts’ expectations and landed in the No. 2 spot with $18 million in sales. A thriller directed by Adam Robitel, the film capitalized on the phenomenon of real-life “escape room” puzzle games, where players (or corporate employees on a team-building trip) are trapped in a room and have to complete a series of challenges to get out. “Escape Room” features a deadly version. While its opening weekend sales were modest beside those of “Aquaman,” the $18 million is a win for Sony given the movie’s $9 million budget. There are few surprises elsewhere in the top ten. Disney’s “Mary Poppins Returns” came in third with $15.8 million this weekend, while Sony’s well-received “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” came in fourth, making $13 million according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. Paramount’s “Bumblebee” rounded out the top five with $12.8 million. Sony’s “Holmes and Watson,” with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, solidifying its status as a flop during its second week in theaters, came in 10th with $3.4 million.

arts The Golden Globes Sets the Thermometer to Warm - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|The Golden Globes Sets the Thermometer to Warm Supported by The Golden Globes Sets the Thermometer to Warm Image Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh hosted the 76th Golden Globe Awards Sunday night at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles.CreditCreditPaul Drinkwater/NBC Universal, via Getty Images By James Poniewozik Jan. 6, 2019 The 2019 Golden Globes didn’t want any trouble. The previous two years, the usually bubbly event found itself responding to upheavals in politics and in the power structure of Hollywood. This year a big issue hanging over the awards ceremony was another awards ceremony: the Oscars, which is still without a host after a search that included the naming and quick unnaming of Kevin Hart, after objections to the comedian’s history of homophobic jokes. The hosts, Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg, kicked off their opening monologue declaring that they were “the only two people left in Hollywood who haven’t gotten in trouble for saying something offensive” and announcing that one lucky audience member “Will! Host! The Oscars!” [Read our analysis from the Golden Globes ceremony | Browse the list of winners] Their opener, amiable if a little stiff, played on the idea of aggressive niceness, “roasting” stars in the room with compliments. Even one of the zingers, a joke by Oh about Hollywood’s casting white actors as Asian characters, produced a cheerfully penitent “I’m sorry!” from Emma Stone, who played a part-Asian character in “Aloha.” Image Carol Burnett was the first recipient of an award named after her, for achievement in television.CreditPaul Drinkwater/NBC Universal, via Getty Images But the most striking part of the duologue came at the end, when Oh turned celebratory to pay tribute to the diverse casts of many of the year’s nominated works. “I see you,” she said. “All these faces of change. And now so will everyone else.” (Her message came across even louder when she won the award for best actress in a TV drama for “Killing Eve” and addressed her parents in Korean.) The awards aside — and you should always set the perplexing Golden Globe Awards choices aside — this year’s Globes were a test case for what works at an awards show these days. Having tried running politically hot and sardonically cold, this year it wondered if warm might be just right. Sometimes it was cozy, sometimes just tepid. There was a sweetness to moments like the honoring of Carol Burnett, the first recipient of an award named after her for achievement in television. Burnett’s big-network variety show, she pointed out, is the sort of thing you don’t see in the cable and streaming era, but she shrugged it off — “Here’s to reruns and YouTube” — before signing off with her signature ear-tug. Image Regina King, who won the supporting film actress award for “If Beale Street Could Talk,” challenged herself and the audience to staff future projects with at least 50 percent women.CreditPaul Drinkwater/NBC Universal The spirit of the past couple years’ Globes activism took a quieter form than the Oprah Winfrey speech that caused a boomlet of 2020 candidacy speculation last year. Regina King, accepting the supporting film actress award for “If Beale Street Could Talk,” challenged herself and the audience to produce projects with 50 percent women. Glenn Close, accepting her best actress award, quipped about her film: “It was called ‘The Wife.’ I think that’s why it took 14 years to get made.” What was mostly absent was partisan political commentary. The former vice president Dick Cheney — the subject of “Vice” — came in for tougher barbs than the current president, who may not be the awards-podium draw he once was. (Christian Bale, who played Cheney, thanked “Satan, for giving me inspiration.”) The awards themselves, on the television side, were a usual Globes mix of genuflecting to big stars (Michael Douglas for “The Kominsky Method”) and mind-boggling choices (“The Kominsky Method” for best comedy). But the awards broke from their usual pattern of recognizing new shows early to, surprisingly, name the deserving “The Americans” best drama in its final season. Image Jeff Bridges won the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award.CreditPaul Drinkwater/NBC Universal, via Getty Images The broadcast was marred, however, by limp presenter patter and production issues like the audience noise after every commercial break, which made watching like trying to have a conversation in a crowded restaurant. In general, the energy was genial but listless — which made the occasional edgy joke startling. (“Break out the tissues,” said Oh introducing the stars of the maudlin “This Is Us,” “because you’re going to want to masturbate to all of them!”) If this Globes mostly wanted to take the edge off, it had the perfect Cecil B. DeMille award recipient in Jeff Bridges, the onetime star of “The Big Lebowski” as the stoner icon the Dude, who gave a speech so exuberantly loopy I think it gave me a contact high. He moseyed from ruminations on Buckminster Fuller to exhortations about, like, life: “We’re alive! Right here, right now! This is happening!” The Globes, which often teeters on the edge of tipsy chaos, seemed Sunday night to be coasting on a mellow, it’s-all-good buzz. It was pleasant enough, though numbing the longer it went on. Though as those who partook more fully of the spirit of the Dude might say: That’s just, like, my opinion, man.

arts Honey Lantree, 75, Rarity as a Female ’60s Rock Drummer, Is Dead - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Obituaries Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Obituaries|Honey Lantree, 75, Rarity as a Female ’60s Rock Drummer, Is Dead Supported by Honey Lantree, 75, Rarity as a Female ’60s Rock Drummer, Is Dead Image Honey Lantree of the Honeycombs in performance in 1964, the year the group’s first and biggest hit, “Have I the Right?” was released.CreditCreditAssociated Newspapers/Shutterstock By Daniel E. Slotnik Jan. 4, 2019 Anne Lantree’s life changed after a chance encounter with a drum kit in 1963. She was working in a hair salon in London owned by her friend Martin Murray. Mr. Murray moonlighted as the rhythm guitarist in an amateur rock ’n’ roll band called the Sheratons, whose drummer had recently quit. His drum kit was still set up at the group’s rehearsal space, and Ms. Lantree, who was there for a guitar lesson, asked if she could try it. Mr. Murray acquiesced, he said in an interview on Thursday, “not giving any thought that she would jump on these drums and play like she had her whole life.” “She was just a born, natural drummer; she hadn’t played before and just went for it,” Mr. Murray continued. “I was aghast, staring at her, and said, ‘All right, you’re our new drummer.’ ” Ms. Lantree’s impromptu solo was the start of a whirlwind career as one of the few women to play drums in a 1960s rock group. The Sheratons soon became the Honeycombs, with Ms. Lantree billed as Honey, and released “Have I the Right?,” a bouncy love song that reached No. 1 on the British pop charts and No. 5 in the United States. Ms. Lantree died on Dec. 23 at her home in Great Bardfield, Essex, England. She was 75. Her son Matthew Coxall said the cause was breast cancer. Female drummers are rare in rock music, and were even rarer in the 1960s. That did not stop Ms. Lantree, who soon began performing with the band. The group, which also featured Dennis D’Ell as lead singer, Allan Ward on lead guitar and John Lantree, her brother, on bass, performed nightly at a local pub that quickly became swamped with admirers. At one show the band met Alan Blaikley and Ken Howard, two aspiring songwriters, and they offered the group “Have I the Right?” (the title is sometimes rendered without the question mark) and many of the other songs that would make up its first album. Notable Deaths 2018: Music A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 The band used its new material to audition for the record producer Joe Meek, who immediately saw their potential. They recorded “Have I the Right?” in Mr. Meek’s studio. Featuring twanging guitars and thumping drums augmented by stomping feet, the song was released as a single by Pye Records, whose managing director suggested that Ms. Lantree go by Honey and that the group become the Honeycombs. The Honeycombs appeared on television and released their first album, called simply “The Honeycombs,” in 1964. Some journalists accused the group of using Ms. Lantree, who dressed stylishly and sported a beehive hairdo, as a gimmick. Some even questioned whether she had actually played the drums on “Have I the Right?” “We couldn’t do nothing about it,” Mr. Murray said, “just deny it, which is the truth.” In late 1964, Peter Pye replaced Mr. Murray, and in 1965 the Honeycombs set off on a tour of Scandinavia, Australia and parts of Asia. That same year the group reached No. 12 on the British pop charts with “That’s the Way,” in which Ms. Lantree sang with Mr. D’Ell, and released a second album, “All Systems Go!” But the Honeycombs’ greatest success was already behind them, and the band broke up in 1967. “It was very traumatic,” Ms. Lantree told an Australian newspaper in 1991. “I was still living at home with my parents, and I went back to hairdressing. People still recognized me, and it was hard to get on with a new life.” Anne Margot Lantree was born on Aug. 28, 1943, in Hayes, Middlesex, England, to John and Nora (Gould) Lantree. Her father owned a sign-making business, and her mother was a homemaker. The family moved to Highams Park, in Northeast London, and Ms. Lantree attended high school there before she started working in Mr. Murray’s salon. Ms. Lantree married David Coxall, a pensions administrator, in 1969. He died in 2018. In addition to her son Matthew, she is survived by another son, Simon; a brother, John; and five grandchildren. Ms. Lantree’s time at the top of the charts was fleeting, but she was not finished with music. Beginning in the 1980s she played with different versions of the Honeycombs. She stopped only when Mr. D’Ell died in 2005. Follow Daniel E.

arts Ralph Koltai, Innovative Stage Designer, Is Dead at 94 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Obituaries Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Obituaries|Ralph Koltai, Innovative Stage Designer, Is Dead at 94 Supported by Ralph Koltai, Innovative Stage Designer, Is Dead at 94 Image A model of Ralph Koltai’s set for a 1997 production of the Verdi opera “Simon Boccanegra.” Mr. Koltai often said that the goal of his stage designs was to enhance, not merely to be functional.CreditCreditRalph Koltai By Neil Genzlinger Dec. 28, 2018 Ralph Koltai, an innovative set designer who gave an abstract, often startling look to hundreds of major theatrical, balletic and operatic productions in England, the United States and elsewhere, died on Dec. 15 in Châtellerault, France. He was 94. Pamela Howard, a friend and fellow designer, said he died at a hospital after a short illness. Mr. Koltai, who emigrated from Germany as a teenager just before World War II and later was part of the British team at the Nuremberg trials, was one of the most influential stage designers of the second half of the 20th century, helping to move theater and opera sets away from mere utility and realism and toward interpretation and statement-making. It was not uncommon for an audience to gasp collectively upon first sight of one of his sets. For the 1972 premiere of Peter Maxwell Davies’s “Taverner” at the Royal Opera House in London, he devised a giant mechanical seesaw that suggested the scales of justice. For the English National Opera’s “Ring” cycle in the 1970s, he used metallic tubes and spheres to create a space-age look that, as the opera critic Hugh Canning later put it, was “futuristic but paradoxically timeless.” And for a Royal Shakespeare Company “Much Ado About Nothing” that made Broadway in 1984, he used a maze of reflecting surfaces, including a mirrored floor, to convey that, as Frank Rich put it in his review in The New York Times, “in ‘Much Ado,’ appearances are everything — and are almost always deceiving.” The goal, Mr. Koltai often said, was to enhance, not merely to be functional. “I still think we have a habit of treating scenery like scenery rather than helping the actor and director to make a statement,” he told The Times in a 1984 interview. “I try and find ways of introducing art into theater, and occasionally I get somewhere near.” Ralph Koltai was born in Berlin on July 31, 1924, to Alfred and Charlotte (Weinstein) Koltai. He attended a progressive Jewish school, but the rise of the Nazis worried his father, a doctor who in 1939 had him sent to England. Image Mr. Koltai in an undated photo. “I try and find ways of introducing art into theater,” he said, "and occasionally I get somewhere near.” He was taken in by Quakers, then sent to a school in Scotland. Eventually he joined the British Army and was stationed in Germany, where one day someone asked, “Can anyone type German?” He raised his hand. “The next thing I knew I was in Essen, where the British were preparing a case against Krupp,” the German industrial giant, he told The Jerusalem Post in 2003. He was then moved to Nuremberg, where he assisted the British team during the trials there after the war. “Ralph never defined himself or his work in terms of his survival or escape from Nazi Germany,” Sophie Rashbrook, a dramaturge who has written a play based on his life, said by email, “although, perhaps as a result of these early experiences, both his life and art were shaped by an alertness to the beauty of chance, instinct and accident.” It was a theme Mr. Koltai himself addressed. “Any talent I have is recognizing the accident when it happens and then pursuing it,” he said in a 2017 video interview for a series called “Breaking the Boundaries,” a title Mr. Koltai said “doesn’t apply to me.” “I never had any boundaries, so I wasn’t aware of the fact that I was breaking anything,” he said. He became a naturalized British citizen soon after the war and studied at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, graduating in 1951. (Later, from 1965 to 1972, he would head the department of theater design there.) He began designing for ballet and opera in the late 1950s and early 1960s he worked on several productions with the choreographer Norman Morrice, whose works were shaking up the Royal Ballet and Ballet Rambert, two venerable British companies. Mr. Koltai’s disdain for traditional realistic sets and backdrops meshed well with Mr. Morrice’s determination to make ballet more contemporary. “The claustrophobic settings by Ralph Koltai, nothing but an impersonal lounge with a steel staircase, grow more impressive as the ballet stealthily shows its hand,” Clive Barnes wrote in The Times, reviewing Mr. Morrice’s “The Travellers” at Sadler’s Wells Theater in 1963. The production, he added, “is clearly calculated to throw a hand grenade into the middle of Britain’s all-too-concentric ballet circles.” Image A model of Mr. Koltai’s set for a 1995 Tokyo production of “Madame Butterfly.”CreditRalph Koltai In the early 1960s Mr. Koltai also began designing for the theater, including for the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 1967 he garnered considerable attention for his designs for the National Theater’s all-male production of “As You Like It,” replacing furniture with geometric forms and rendering the trees of the Forest of Arden as plexiglass tubes. Mr. Koltai said that directors tended to leave him on his own on any given project, and that he worked from glimmers of input and inspiration. “People think one has long, in-depth conversations with a director,” he told The Times in 1984, “but often designs stem from a hint. I don’t respond well to being told what is wanted.” Other notable credits include the Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Cyrano de Bergerac,” which was brought to Broadway with “Much Ado” in 1984; the 1985 Broadway play “Pack of Lies”; and the English National Opera’s 1987 production of Stephen Sondheim’s “Pacific Overtures.” Not all of his projects were successes, however. His résumé also included the infamous musical “Carrie,” which flopped on Broadway in 1988. Mr. Koltai’s first marriage, to the costume designer Annena Stubbs, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Jane Alexander Koltai, whom he married in 2008. Beyond his many individual productions, Mr. Koltai was known for his influence on younger designers. “He really brought abstract thinking into theater design and did away with the fourth wall and the box set,” Ti Green, a designer who has worked with numerous English theater companies over the last 25 years, told the theater publication The Stage in September. She added, “He saw theater design as a sculpture and a work of fine art.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Ralph Koltai, Set Designer Who Made a Statement With Scenery, Dies at 94.

arts ‘Aquaman’ Is Already a Box Office Titan - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Arts Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Arts|‘Aquaman’ Is Already a Box Office Titan Supported by ‘Aquaman’ Is Already a Box Office Titan Image Jason Momoa in “Aquaman,” which Warner Bros. is counting on to become its next superhero franchise.CreditCreditWarner Bros. and DC Comics By Brooks Barnes Dec. 9, 2018 LOS ANGELES — The box office action over the weekend took place in China, where “Aquaman” collected $94 million in tickets, validating a risky plan by Warner Bros. to release the movie in the Middle Kingdom before anywhere else. Hollywood has learned a lot about Chinese moviegoers in recent years, but releasing films in the country — the world’s No. 2 market behind the United States — remains a crapshoot for American studios. Warner and other Hollywood companies cannot distribute their own movies in China; they must rely on the state-owned China Film Group. Chinese censors often do not clear American films for distribution until the relative last minute, hindering marketing efforts. And Chinese audiences have grown more selective about Hollywood movies, at times displaying a new preference for locally made movies like the extravagant “Operation Red Sea,” directed by Dante Lam, known as the Michael Bay of Asia. The upshot: “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa as the DC Comics superhero and directed by James Wan, could have easily flopped in China, which would have left a stink on the movie ahead of its global rollout. “Aquaman,” which cost an estimated $350 million to make and market worldwide, will arrive in 40 more countries on Friday. Audiences in North America will have the chance to see it starting on Dec. 21. Warner decided to pursue an early release date for “Aquaman” in China to avoid the country’s traditional end-of-year blackout period for American movies. Opening first in China — where Wan has a following, having directed the smash hit “Furious 7” — would also allow Warner to limit the impact of piracy, which is rampant in the country. Piracy was a major factor in the recent failure of Warner’s “Crazy Rich Asians” at the Chinese box office; the romantic comedy’s release in China came three months after its rollout elsewhere in the world. Why didn’t Warner just release “Aquaman” this weekend in North America as well? The two weekends after Thanksgiving in the United States are typically among the slowest moviegoing periods of the year, as holiday shopping and related festivities (school pageants) take priority. There were no new wide-release films over the weekend in North America, where the No. 1 movie was once again “Ralph Breaks the Internet” (Disney), which collected about $16.1 million, for a three week domestic total of $140.9 million, according to Comscore. Three high-profile prestige films arrived in limited release. “Mary Queen of Scots” (Focus Features), starring Saoirse Ronan in the title role, took in $200,000 at four theaters, for a solid per-theater average of $50,045. The slick “Vox Lux” (Neon), starring Natalie Portman as a pop singer, took in about $162,000 in six theaters, for a per-screen average of $27,000 that was boosted by in-person appearances by Portman. “Ben Is Back” (Roadside Attractions) received the best reviews of the trio but stumbled out of the gate, collecting about $81,000 at four theaters ($20,200 per screen) — one of the worst debuts ever for Julia Roberts, who stars in the film as a mother of a drug-addicted son, played by Lucas Hedges.

arts Edward Gorey’s Children’s Books Illustrations, Revisited - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Edward Gorey’s Children’s Books Illustrations, Revisited Supported by From Our Archives Edward Gorey’s Children’s Books Illustrations, Revisited Jan. 4, 2019 To call Edward Gorey eccentric is an understatement. The illustrator, whose work amassed an almost cultlike following in his lifetime and beyond, was a mystery. In this week’s issue of the Book Review, Robert Gottlieb reviews “Born to be Posthumous,” a new biography by Mark Dery that explores Gorey’s peculiar life and “genius” art. His illustrations — particularly for children’s books — were widely celebrated, though often misunderstood. Below we revisit some of Gorey’s work that placed him on The New York Times Book Review’s Best Illustrated Children’s Books list. 1966 An illustration from “The Monster Den, or Look What Happened at My House — and to It,” by John Ciardi, which the Book Review chose as one of the best illustrated children’s books in 1966. Our original review called Gorey’s illustrations “elegant and droll.” Image CreditEdward Gorey Charitable Trust 1969 In 1969, the Book Review praised Gorey for his drawings in Edward Lear’s “The Dong With a Luminous Nose.” While our reviewer admired its “lovely tea party and dance scenes,” she worried children would not understand them because they were “too scenic to register.” Image CreditEdward Gorey 1971 Two years later, Gorey was rewarded again for his illustrations. This time for “The Shrinking of Treehorn,” by Florence Parry Heide. “It’s always a pleasure to see that a new vehicle has been found for Edward Gorey’s distinctive drawings, and in this instance a fey, imaginative little tale that fits them to perfection,” our reviewer wrote.

It terminated abruptly in what are now the boroughs, leaving the city with a unique landscape. A view from Green-Wood Cemetery, near Battle Hill, which is Brooklyn’s highest spot.CreditCreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times Supported by By William J. Broad June 5, 2018 At the start of the last ice age, 2.6 million years ago, a sheet of frozen water formed atop North America that kept expanding and thickening until it reached a maximum depth of roughly two miles. At its southern edge, the vast body deposited tons of rocky debris — from sand and pebbles to boulders the size of school buses. Then, some 18,000 years ago, the planet began to warm and the gargantuan sheet of ice began to melt and retreat. Today, the southernmost edge of that frozen expanse is marked by a line of rubble that extends across the northern United States for thousands of miles. The largest deposits form what geologists call a terminal moraine. The intermittent ridge runs from Puget Sound to the Missouri River to Montauk Point on Long Island, forming the prominence that supports its old lighthouse. The ancient sheet of ice also left its mark on a very modern phenomenon: New York City. The ice over Manhattan would have buried even the tallest skyscraper and was so heavy that it depressed the underlying bedrock. As it melted, giant boulders embedded deep within its flanks landed throughout what became the city. Many are still visible in Central Park, unlikely obelisks scored by time. But the island was the last hurrah, and the mammoth sheet of ice ended immediately to the south, in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The terminal moraine, the mounds of rubble left behind, form much of their high ground. Image Boulders like this one in Forest Park in Woodhaven were deposited by the ice sheet as it retreated. They are called erratics.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times While the line of glacial debris across the northern United States is often poorly delineated, the hilly ridge around New York City tends to be quite prominent. Its maximum height is roughly 200 feet, about that of a tall apartment building. The rubble slowed the development of the other boroughs for centuries. Early developers sought flat land for homes and buildings and typically ignored the glacial ridges, especially their heights. Land there was too inaccessible, stony and yielding for easy construction. Eventually, the neglected parcels became strings of parks, cemeteries, golf courses and, in time, some of the region’s most attractive neighborhoods, often heavily landscaped and densely wooded. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Today the ridgeline and its adjoining slopes hold Forest Park and Highland Park in Queens, as well as Prospect Park in Brooklyn. The nearby grounds of Green-Wood Cemetery include Battle Hill, a part of the glacial rise that represents the borough’s highest point. Many city neighborhoods take their names from the ridge’s elevations, as well as its leafy embellishments: Glen Oaks, Hollis Hills, Jamaica Hills, Briarwood, Forest Hills, Ridgewood, Cypress Hills, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Greenwood, Bay Ridge, Lighthouse Hill and Arden Heights. Why should remnants of the last ice age be so prominent in New York City, of all places? Glacial Relics It started long ago as the continental ice sheet developed one of its thickest regions over what is now eastern Canada. Vast fields of ice are incredibly weighty. Gravity pushes down hard. Any tilt or slant of the underlying terrain sends the ice moving slowly downslope. For ages, the Canadian ice kept flowing into a long valley to the south that ran from the Lake Champlain area down through the Hudson River gorge. It was a reliable conduit. The river of ice and rock kept moving relentlessly southward until it hit a region warm enough to halt its slow advance. During ice ages, glaciers advance and retreat in cycles. Paths differ. But overall, the southern end of the conduit saw massive buildups of boulders and rubble. In recent times, the resulting moraine got much scrutiny from scientists because of its proximity to one of the nation’s first big cities. Just as early maps of the United States often focused on New York, so did geologic inquiries — starting nearly two centuries ago. Despite the ridge’s prominence and early allure for scientists, it turned out to be no rival for skyscrapers and urban distractions. The moraine that shaped the city was all but forgotten. “Clearly, it’s not on the radar,” said David E. Seidemann, a professor of geology at Brooklyn College. “The educational system here doesn’t emphasize earth science. And there’s so much else to do. I’ll go to a Yankees game over geology any day.” Related Coverage On a Clear Day You Can See an Ice Age: One Journalist’s View From the Upper West SideJune 5, 2018 Springtime, noted Sidney Horenstein, a geologist and environmental educator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, turns the glacial rise into a band of leafy green and opens a season favorable to its rediscovery. “It makes it much easier to see,” he said recently, while gazing at the ridge from the Staten Island Ferry. Mr. Horenstein, 81, sought to deepen the re-examination by sharing with The Times a vast trove he had assembled of scientific studies, official reports, news clippings, magazine articles and old books that mention or profile the city’s glacial relic. Image Sidney Horenstein, geologist and environmental educator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times His collection also sheds light on how moraine study in general helped geologists in New York and elsewhere discover that the planet had experienced a series of ice ages. That breakthrough came in the mid 1800s. Ridges, mountains and even flatlands are typically rooted in rocky strata, such as the bedrock that underlies Manhattan and makes it ideal for erecting skyscrapers. But early investigators found the hilly ridges to be composed of clay, silt, sand, pebbles, cobbles and boulders, all jumbled up together. A related clue was that nearby rocks often looked quite smooth, even polished. At times, their faces also displayed parallel lines of groves and striations. In 1843, an official report on the natural history of New York State cited vast glaciers as a possible explanation “now attracting much attention” for what geologists were uncovering. But it also listed a dozen other theories, including “the deluge of Noah,” or the biblical flood. By the 1860s, a growing body of evidence had convinced most scientists that the Earth had endured ages in which rivers of ice transported rocks and coarse sediments over long distances — at times, it turned out, for hundreds of miles. In the 1880s, the term “ice age” was coming into wide use, and experts began looking into some of the practical consequences. Then in 1902, the United States Geological Survey published a large folio on metropolitan New York that detailed its rocky underpinnings, including the ridge. Multicolored maps showed the glacial rise amid emerging street grids and neighborhoods. The accompanying report said the rise exhibited strings of “hillocks and hollows, or interrupted ridges and troughs.” It noted that some depressions held ponds, marshes and small lakes. The report put the feature’s overall width at up to two miles.

Early reservoirs often were established on the city's moraine.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times At first, the city used the stony ridge for woodlots and rain catchments. Slowly, the uses expanded to reservoirs, recreational areas and, in time, neighborhoods in which buildings and houses were built on strong footings and foundations for stability. Today, despite the wide development of the ridge’s lower slopes, a Google Earth view of New York City — a composite of images from April, June and September — shows the glacial relic as an intermittent band of green.

Unused land atop the glacial ridge eventually became parkland.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times A Geological Guide Talkative and outgoing, his shirt often untucked, the model of a rumpled geologist, Mr. Horenstein is a native New Yorker with boyish enthusiasm for the city’s hidden faults and early beginnings, for ancient blows and catastrophes. A compendium of geologic jokes, he refers to himself not as a raconteur but a rockconteur. Though long retired, Mr. Horenstein regularly gives public tours of the city’s geology, some of them organized by the museum. Recently, at a reporter’s invitation, he turned his attention to the glacial ridge. At Umpire Rock in Central Park, overlooking baseball fields, the geologist noted places where glacial ice and rubble had carved massive grooves, wider than a human body. Yet the rock’s overall surface was quite smooth. The reason, Mr. Horenstein said, was that ages of glacial abrasion had acted like sandpaper. “Kids can slide down the rocks,” he said of many Central Park outcroppings. Image Umpire Rock in Central Park, whose distinctive grooves were formed by glacial ice and rubble.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times Image Left, Mr. Horenstein at the American Museum of Natural History. Right, finer grooves etched into Umpire Rock.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times Throughout the park are places where the retreating ice had dropped giant boulders that geologists call erratics, after the Latin word errare, to wander. By definition, the boulders differ in composition from surrounding rocks. Some of the park’s erratics sit perched atop flat rocks, looking at times like alien monuments. “They’re rounded,” Mr. Horenstein said, because rivers of ice kept “dragging them around.” Later, on a visit to Staten Island, he pointed to the much-celebrated skyline of Lower Manhattan. Current estimates put the ice’s thickness there at roughly twice the early calculations — not 1,000 feet, but closer to 2,000 feet, and possibly more. “It was taller than any building,” Mr. Horenstein remarked, “even the Freedom Tower.” The skyscraper at the very top of its spire measures 1,776 feet high, after the nation’s birthday. The forward edges of glaciers can be inclined or sheer, like a cliff. Mr. Horenstein said geologists believe the local face was sheer. Its precipitous edge shed not only tons of rocky debris but gargantuan blocks of ice. The ice’s overall weight was so immense that it depressed the bedrock of the New York City region — and then, following the sheet’s retreat, the rocky depths slowly rebounded. Mr. Horenstein said the rise is calculated at more than 150 feet. Image The ice sheet is estimated to have been 2,000 feet or more thick, taller than One World Trade, whose spire measures 1,776 feet.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times At Fort Wadsworth, a historic battlement next to the Verrazano Bridge, we stood atop the moraine and looked across the Narrows, the strait between Staten Island and Brooklyn. The land that would become the two boroughs had originally been connected by the glacial ridge. Some 13,000 years ago, a large accumulation of icy water from melting glaciers was suddenly unleashed upstate. A towering wave of destruction crashed down through the Hudson gorge and proceeded to smash the southern end of the local moraine to smithereens. “It was biblical,” Mr. Horenstein said. The wave created the Narrows, which now connects the Atlantic Ocean to one of the world’s largest natural harbors. In the metropolitan area, the southern tip of Staten Island overlooks the Arthur Kill and Raritan Bay, and represents the southernmost part of the glacial rise. The site hosts the Conference House Park. It takes its name from an unsuccessful peace conference held there in 1776 during the Revolutionary War. As we walked past a stone manor house where the meeting took place, Mr. Horenstein pointed to the rounded rocks in its walls and, based on color and texture, proceeded to tick off their likely sites of origin — some from upstate New York, some from New Jersey, and so on. What fraction came from the glacial ridge? “All of them,” he replied. “It was the local building material.” We walked down to the nearby beach and wandered a few hundred feet to where the land formed a sandy bluff. It offered a rare glimpse into the heart of the ridge: a jumble of clay, silt, pebbles and boulders in a fragile matrix laid bare by the action of tides, hurricanes and pounding waves. In all of New York City, “this is the only place you can see the moraine clearly,” Mr. Horenstein said, leaning into the wind. “This is it, the southernmost end.” Mr. Horenstein held up a rounded stone. Somehow, it ended up in reporter’s backpack as a souvenir of the day. Image The moraine once joined Brooklyn and Staten Island, but was smashed 13,000 years ago by a catastrophic wave, leaving the Narrows.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times Image Left, a stone recovered by Mr. Horenstein and kept as a souvenir. Right, the wall of the stone manor that housed the failed 1776 peace conference.CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times Remarkably, millions of people live on or near the glacial ridge. In all, it runs for roughly 30 miles beneath New York City. Invisibly, it links three boroughs, offering mute testimony to the power of vanished ice. If the ridge is lost history to most of the city’s inhabitants, at least one knows something about the art of bringing it back to life. “It keeps me young,” Mr. Horenstein said. “There’s always something to see, something you missed, something new.” Image CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York Times William J.

After the Golden Globes hosts Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg delivered a mostly safe opening, going out of their way to praise the work of Hollywood, Oh ended the first segment on an emotional note about improvements in diversity in the film and television industry. Several films in the spotlight this awards season feature women and people of color. Oh’s hosting gig is itself a barrier breaker: she is the first Asian woman to front a major awards show in the United States. Oh told the crowd, “I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change. And I’m not fooling myself. I’m not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real.” Before Oh’s remarks turned earnest, she and Samberg started off with a bit in which he “read” Oh’s lines off the teleprompter. That evolved into Samberg’s newfound understanding about “whitewashing” in Hollywood, a term that usually refers to white actors being given a part initially written for a person of color. SAMBERG: Now, I know we are up here joking. But on a serious note, this year, we saw incredible work like “Black Panther,” “Crazy Rich Asians,” “If Beale Street Could Talk,” “Roma,” “Pose,” “BlacKkKlansman,” and many more. And they are not just here tonight because they resonated with audiences Hollywood often ignores, they are here because they told stories that resonated with everyone. And that is truly a beautiful thing. OH: Wow, Andy, can I just say that you just read all of my lines off the teleprompter? SAMBERG: What? No, those were mine. Here, let me keep going. “When I was growing up in Canada, the daughter of Korean immigrants,” O.K. You know what? You are right. That was totally your stuff. Oh, my God. I just totally whitewashed your speech. That’s how it happens. OH: That’s not how it happens. SAMBERG: What an amazing learning experience for me. OH: O.K. would you stop talking? SAMBERG: You got it. OH: But if I could take a moment here, in all honesty: I said yes to the fear of being on this stage tonight because — because I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change. And I’m not fooling myself. I’m not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real. Trust me, it is real. Because I see you. And I see you.

By Jesse Green Dec. 9, 2018 Kaneisha begs Mista Jim, her overseer on the MacGregor plantation, to call her a “nasty Negress” as he forces himself upon her. Mistress Alana, the lady of the manor, lustily wields her mother’s hand-me-down dildo to penetrate Phillip, her violin-playing house slave. Elsewhere on the Virginia plantation, Gary, who is black, makes a white indentured servant named Dustin bring him to orgasm by licking his boots. That’s how “Slave Play,” which opened on Sunday at New York Theater Workshop, begins — and then it gets really outrageous. Saying much more would mean giving away at least one huge surprise that this willfully provocative, gaudily transgressive and altogether staggering new play by Jeremy O. Harris has in store. And yet its urgency and sheer cultural heft, deployed like weapons in a furiously entertaining production directed by Robert O’Hara, don’t leave much choice. It all but demands to be — in its own terminology — processed. So proceed with caution, and let’s make “spoiler” our safe word, shall we? Not that there’s much pretense to narrative normalcy. You will know something’s askew even before you get to the end of the first of those quasi-pornographic playlets. Kaneisha (Teyonah Parris) is more assertive — and Mista Jim (Paul Alexander Nolan) more nervous — than you would expect in a real antebellum encounter. Then, too, Kaneisha is occasionally overtaken by musical fits in which Rihanna’s song “Work” causes her to twerk. Music plays a role in the other sex scenes as well. Mistress Alana (Annie McNamara) can’t stand the “new” tunes by Beethoven that Phillip (Sullivan Jones) prefers to play; she instead demands a spiritual, or whatever it is that makes “the ladies down at y’all’s cabin” swoon. And as Gary (Ato Blankson-Wood) starts to dominate Dustin (James Cusati-Moyer), he is suddenly overcome by the song “Multi-Love,” a 2015 hit from Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Image James Cusati-Moyer, left, and Ato Blankson-Wood in an encounter in “Slave Play,” by Jeremy O. Harris.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times Though Mr. Harris is still in drama school, and “Slave Play” is his first professional New York production, he writes as if he’s known all his life how to twist audiences into all kinds of pretzels. In particular I can say as a white person that he manipulates white discomfort expertly to the advantage of his storytelling. Until I encountered his potent brew of minstrelsy and melodrama I hadn’t known it was possible — except perhaps in plays like “Bootycandy,” by Mr. O’Hara — to cringe and laugh and blush at the same time. So it comes as a relief, at first, when the play completely changes course about a quarter of the way through its intermissionless two hours. The six characters now reappear — spoiler! — as contemporary interracial couples in sex therapy. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] It seems that the MacGregor plantation has become a resort and conference center; the couples are there as part of a weeklong program run by the social scientists Teá (Chalia La Tour) and Patricia (Irene Sofia Lucio), late of Smith and Yale. Their program focuses primarily on helping the black participants, who are no longer able to receive pleasure from their white — or whiter — partners. The scenes we saw at the beginning of the play were their therapeutic fantasies, spun out in role-play. Mr. Harris does not squander the satirical opportunities this setup offers. Words like “positionality,” “minoritarian” and “heteropatriarchal” get quite a workout as Ms. La Tour and Ms. Lucio mine characters whose intelligence has been co-opted by cant. And though some of this material could use pruning, Mr. O’Hara proves the perfect collaborator in staging it, playing the comedy so bright and dense that you don’t have the bandwidth to grow bored. Nor do you notice, until you’re too far along, that comedy is not all it is. Because the thing about this therapy — perhaps like the play — is that it works not despite but because of its absurdity. Teá and Patricia’s “processing” of the black participants’ fantasies gives them access to insight that their social conditioning had previously obscured. None of that insight is welcome news for their partners. If Dustin, Alana and especially Jim — a Brit who finds the whole concept insane and traumatizing — are unable to see what their whiteness has to do with it, we in the audience see it all too clearly. Gary, Phillip and Kaneisha exist “squarely in the blind spot of their nonblack partner,” a phrase that is no less damning for being clinical. Though all of the black participants have psychological cofactors, including obsessive-compulsive disorders, it misses the point to say the deck has been stacked. Mr. Harris isn’t making a universal statement about individuals in interracial partnerships; he’s aiming at the interracial partnership of America as a whole. By the time the play, which has a classical form much like a sonata, reaches a final scene involving just one of the couples, its sharp narrowing in feels like a vast broadening out. In plantation America, which in Mr. Harris’s cosmology is both antebellum and post-, can white people learn to love black people — not just their music and their plays — as actual black people, on black people’s terms? “Slave Play” is extreme, both in the way it poses that question through sex and in posing the question at all. It asks a lot of its superior cast, whose portrayal of arousal and fury and shame feels terrifyingly real even within a very artificial reality. The designers — Clint Ramos (scenery), Dede Ayite (costumes), Jiyoun Chang (lighting) and Lindsay Jones (sound) — create that artificial world with great theatrical wit and intelligence. The intimacy director, Claire Warden, has been kept very busy. “Slave Play” asks a lot of the audience, too — but let me speak just of myself. It’s hard for a critic to heed what seems to be its general instruction, at least to white people, to shut up for once and listen. If you are in the reviewing trade, you wonder whether that’s just a feint at foiling criticism. So be it. But I find myself unable to resist “processing,” and grateful to hear so plainly, the idea that Mr. Harris puts forward in the silent space his play insists on clearing: that one race lives with history each day while another pretends not to. In late 2018, I fear that’s still a spoiler.

She was 60. Judy Glantzman, a friend and fellow artist, said the cause was breast cancer. Ms. Clements’s drawings — generally in sumi ink or ballpoint pen — and her paintings often used multiple sheets of crinkled paper, stitched together into large, irregular shapes that contrasted with the technical precision of her hand. “Everything looks simultaneously arranged and disordered,” the critic John Yau wrote last year on the arts site Hyperallergic of “Three Tables in Rome,” a recent watercolor. Image Dawn Clements in 2013 at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Italy, where she had a residency.CreditCivitella Ranieri Foundation, via Pierogi Gallery That work, which depicts an assemblage of fruit, foil packets, electronics and other items (including a box of Xeloda, a cancer medication) sprawled across three tables, is representative of several characteristics of Ms. Clements’s art. For one thing, it has a diaristic quality to it, the artist seeming intent on documenting everything around her. For another, it’s an unusual shape: an elongated rectangle with an appendage (the third of the three tables) hanging off the bottom right. And it is huge, more than 20 feet in length. “When I’m making them, I’m constantly changing my point of view, especially in a piece that’s 45 feet long,” she said of these large works in a 2007 interview with The Brooklyn Rail. “The viewer must move and constantly change his/her point of view.” The effect, she said, echoes human experience. “With the panoramic drawings,” she said, “I’m interested in the way we see as we move through life, instead of when we’re sitting still.” Ms. Clements drew and painted from life, but she also found source material in old movies. A wall-size drawing in the 2010 Whitney Biennial was a striking example. Titled “Mrs. Jessica Drummond’s (‘My Reputation,’ 1946),” it depicted the sprawling interior of a home in the 1946 romantic drama “My Reputation,” which starred Barbara Stanwyck as a character named Jessica Drummond. Image “Three Tables in Rome” (2017), watercolor on paper, 85 by 248.5 inches.CreditJoe Amrhein, via Pierogi Gallery She made such works, she said, not simply by copying a single still image from a movie, but by watching the whole film and compiling a selection of interior shots from different angles. It was an interest, she said, that began with a focus on movies’ stars but morphed into something else. “For years I drew the figures, lots and lots of drawings of Joan Crawford and Lana Turner, all those women and their crises,” she told The L Magazine in 2012, “but at a certain moment I started to realize that almost everything in melodrama is happening indoors. They’re these crazy places that are often beautiful homes, well appointed, everybody’s miserable, nobody can leave, the door is wide open but they can’t get out. So I thought, what is it about always being inside? I’ve got to address that.” Dawn Marie Clements was born on April 14, 1958, in Woburn Mass., to Bruce and Carlene (Johnson) Clements. She grew up in Chelmsford, Mass., and received a bachelor’s degree at Brown University in 1986. In a 2014 talk at the Vermont Studio Center, she recalled studying movies at Brown without the benefit of DVDs or even videotapes. “They were projected from a chattering film projector, and we got to see them twice, and that was all,” she said. “So I got used to writing and drawing images and text just like a maniac in the dark.” She went on to earn a master of fine arts degree at the University at Albany in 1989. By 1993 she was represented in the Venice Biennale. Later in the 1990s she was in group exhibitions at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the University Art Museum in Albany and numerous other places. Since the turn of the century, her work has been seen in scores of group shows, including at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Bates College Museum of Art in Lewiston, Me., as well as in China, Belgium, England and elsewhere. Notable Deaths 2018: Arts and Styles A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 Ms. Clements, who lived and worked in Brooklyn, had numerous solo exhibitions as well, including several at Pierogi Gallery in New York, which represented her. Those included a 2012 collaboration with the sculptor Marc Leuthold. Ms. Clements’s marriage to Roberto Bocci ended in divorce. She is survived by her mother and three brothers, Philip, Stephen and Carl.

Parenting Advice Often Makes It Harder. Supported by Books of The Times Raising Kids Isn’t Easy. Parenting Advice Often Makes It Harder. By Jennifer Szalai Jan. 2, 2019 Image CreditCreditSonny Figueroa/The New York Times Buy Book ▾ Amazon Local Booksellers Barnes and Noble When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Americans supposedly have little patience for expertise these days — except, it seems, when it comes to parenting experts, who continue to churn out guides as quickly as their audience can consume them. This appetite for counsel inevitably reflects deeper, often unspoken middle-class aspirations and anxieties; as the psychoanalyst and essayist Adam Phillips once observed, the appeal of such books goes beyond the immediate need to deal with a sullen teenager or a sleepless newborn. “Our obsession with child development and with so-called parenting skills,” he wrote, “has become a code for our forlorn attempt to find a sanity for ourselves.” Jennifer Traig apparently agrees. In “Act Natural: A Cultural History of Misadventures in Parenting,” she takes solace in how useless, contradictory and downright harmful so much advice has historically been. “The things we take for granted as normal and natural strike parents in other parts of the world as absurd and dangerous,” she writes, in this brisk survey of child-rearing tips through the ages. As the parent of two children and the author of previous books about obsessive-compulsive disorder and hypochondria, Traig wanted to examine how “developed-world, middle-class Westerners” learned to follow a script that is so culturally specific. She ended her research feeling not just informed but relieved: “People have done crazy, crazy things to their children throughout history, and the species continued all the same.” The species may have survived, though the fates of individual children were another matter. The history recounted in this book is studded with violence and death. Child abandonment was once routine; in Ancient Rome, 20 to 40 percent of babies were left to die of exposure. Even the advent of foundling hospitals in European cities didn’t help much; the mortality rates in some institutions (understaffed, suffused with disease) could reach 90 percent. Parents have always found raising children to entail a great deal of work, enlisting relatives and servants — sometimes handing offspring over to religious orders. As Traig says, “the history of parenting is, in large part, a history of trying to get out of it.” This was true even when babies were considered little laborers-to-be, expected to contribute within a few years to the family livelihood. Image Jennifer TraigCreditRob Mickey Philosophers like Locke and Rousseau published treatises on childhood education, but it was only toward the end of the 19th century — when children became, in the sociologist Viviana Zelizer’s memorable phrase, “economically worthless but emotionally priceless” — that parents began to see themselves as wholly responsible for cultivating a child’s intellectual and emotional life. In the 1970s, the term “to parent” emerged as an active verb. A lot of parenting advice has historically had to do with the physical needs of the mother and child; a lot of it also turned out to be fatal. Colostrum, for instance, was once considered so toxic that mothers were instructed to feed their newborns honey instead, thereby trading the antibodies in breastmilk for botulism. It was often male doctors who dispensed such advice — the same cohort that was so sure of its expertise that it unwittingly infected laboring mothers with puerperal fever in maternity hospitals during the 18th and 19th centuries. Doctors blamed the epidemic on sour breastmilk, tight corsets, bad air; it took a while before they grudgingly bought into the germ theory of disease and started to wash their hands between patients and after autopsies. Traig’s book is filled with tales of men telling women what to do, and she’s candid about how furious it makes her. She calls one eminent 19th-century doctor “A PATRONIZING CHAUVINIST” (the all caps are all hers; she later admits that her go-to disciplinary move with her own children is to yell). Old medical textbooks, from the ancient Greeks through the medieval Europeans, are filled with men’s specious assertions about feminine hygiene: “I think we can agree that anyone who feels qualified to hold forth on something he has no actual knowledge of can, rather accurately, be called a douche,” she quips. She isn’t wrong, but the nonstop vaudeville can get wearying. Some of her punch lines are so broad that they should be accompanied by a sad trombone. She describes the Puritans arriving to America “like a wet, smallpox-infected blanket to put a damper on all the fun” (genocide, amirite?). Lewis Carroll’s creepy overture to a young girl “starts to sound an awful lot like an invitation to a pool party at Roman Polanski’s.” Parenting is a subject that generates so much piety that you can’t fault Traig for having a sense of gallows humor, though the calibration is off. Part of this has to do with how skillful and fluid a writer she is otherwise — the facts seem to tumble forth, in a way that makes her jokes feel superfluous (when they aren’t awful) and strenuous (when they are). Much of the story she tells is pieced together from other books, including Ann Hulbert’s “Raising America” and Sarah Blaffer Hrdy’s “Mother Nature.” Still, it’s a fascinating narrative, tracing the long history of mistakes and reversals and cultural presuppositions that have structured our most intimate relationships. Depicting herself as both extremely lazy and extremely anxious, Traig says that what she wants the most as a parent is some reassurance that she isn’t doing it wrong: “Parenting is so hard; and like our kids, we’re all looking for permission to slack off in some areas.” Sometimes, though, Traig can’t help herself, declining to step away from the kid or the joke. “Doing nothing,” she admits, “is often the hardest thing to do.” Follow Jennifer Szalai on Twitter: @jenszalai.

Through her nude self-portraits, Brigman used her camera to define a modern era for American women in society.CreditCreditWilson Centre for Photography By Rebecca Kleinman Dec. 26, 2018 RENO, Nev. — The California photographer, poet and mountaineer Anne Brigman broke boundaries by any era’s standards. Nearly a century before the memoirist Cheryl Strayed (“Wild”) laced up her hiking boots and took a walk on the wild side in the Sierra Nevada mountain range — a precursor to millennials’ obsession with forest bathing — Brigman was going on expeditions deep into its Desolation Valley and Donner Summit around Lake Tahoe. Never mind these were inhospitable areas ridden with predators and imposing, hellish granite outcrops. Residing most of her life in Oakland, Calif., she typically arrived to Sacramento by stagecoach and set out on foot without the luxury of the trails and maps hikers have today. The occasional guides who set up her campsites were bewildered by her choice of terrain, barely explored by the nascent Sierra Club. “Fear is the great chain which binds women and prevents their development, and fear is the one apparently big thing which has no foundation in life,” she told The San Francisco Call in 1913. Image “The Breeze,” 1909 and printed 1915, gelatin silver print, was part of Brigman’s creative dialogue with nature and the human form.CreditWilson Centre for Photography In a later article, she said, “I wanted to go and be free.” The Kardashians and their attention-seeking ilk can’t hold a candle to her moxie. The self-taught Brigman photographed herself nude in her beloved, gnarled landscape — her performance theater, really — beginning in 1905. The act is believed to have birthed one of the first, nude photographic self-portraits by an American woman, and possibly by a woman worldwide. Heightening the sensationalism, she did so after losing a breast in a freak accident at sea. A childless proto-feminist who strongly supported the suffragist movement, she preferred knickerbockers and tunics for her treks when most Edwardian-age women wore corsets and ground-grazing dresses in the great outdoors. In yet another bold move, Brigman ditched her husband, a much older ship captain whom she latched onto as her ticket to travel the world, in 1910; tending to him in retirement back home wasn’t exactly what she had in mind. While her artist peers continue to rack up show after show (Georgia O’Keeffe and Frida Kahlo have been rediscovered as art institutions’ golden geese), Brigman remains relatively unknown even in her own backyard, despite a period of international notoriety as the only fellow west of the River in the Photo-Secession, Alfred Stieglitz’s fine-art photography group. It has taken 68 years after her death in 1950 for her to receive her first major retrospective, organized by the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno, Nev. “Anne Brigman: A Visionary in Modern Photography,” which runs through Jan. 27. Image “Sanctuary,” negative 1910, gelatin silver print, reproduced from “Songs of a Pagan,” a book of Brigman’s poems and photographs.CreditYale University She was “very interested in living in harmony with nature and seeing the female body as interconnected with place and with trees and with all of the elements,” said Ann M. Wolfe, the museum’s senior curator and deputy director, who organized the exhibition. Ms. Wolfe also edited its 400-page catalog, the first comprehensive book about Brigman, which Rizzoli Electra has published along with a reprint of Brigman’s breathtaking book of poetry, “Songs of a Pagan” (1949). “I felt it was important not to have just a book of beautiful plates but to really start to lay out an archival research resource,” Ms. Wolfe said. She said she hoped it would spur an understanding of the significance of Brigman’s work. The multimedia presentation begins with her childhood in Hawaii, a mango-sweetened swirl of exotic experiences at odds with her daughterly duties as the eldest child in a large missionary family. Photographs by her mentors and contemporaries as well as block prints and a drawing add context to her oeuvre. Many viewers are surprised to learn she was also a gifted poet, whose verses are as moving and relatable as lyrics by Bob Dylan and Neil Young. The majority of the exhibit’s correspondence focuses on her long-term relationship with Stieglitz, her biggest champion. Image Study of sand erosion, 1935, by Anne Brigman.

Jane Wilson 2007 Trust “Laid Bare in the Landscape,” the Nevada Museum’s concurrent group show, examines her undeniable legacy through 16 female contemporary artists, including Ana Mendieta and Judy Chicago, whose works also stage their bodies amid the landscape. “I was just so moved by the fact that so many of our visitors right here in northern Nevada, not more than 50 miles from where Brigman made some of these photographs, that nobody knew her name,” Ms. Wolfe said. Brigman slipped through the cracks of the art history canon in the perfect storm. Though ahead of her time in practically every facet of her life, from tiny homes to recognition of first nations, she was part of the pictorialist movement, whose romanticized portraits of white-attired women in gardens missed the modernist zeitgeist that propelled artists she influenced to 21st-century relevance. Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham and O’Keeffe were just a few fans. Her Bay Area art circle’s stronghold further crumbled from San Francisco’s catastrophic earthquake and fire in 1906. Image Louis Fleckenstein’s portrait of Anne Brigman, for “The Pictorialist,” circa 1934, toned gelatin silver print.CreditLouis Fleckenstein Not helping matters are her unorganized archives, and the fact that she began her photography career late, at 32. Because she tossed out some of her early work, the retrospective makes do with reproductions in archived issues of Camera Craft. Michael Wilson, the James Bond film producer and art collector who lent 80 works for the show, purchased an entire cache from someone’s dumpster-diving score in the 1980s. “Not many pictorialists would have this kind of show today,” he said, of museums’ shift toward contemporary art. “Contemporary women artists like Judy [Chicago] take you by the neck and shake you. They provoke reaction but not an emotional state. It’s not about aesthetics and beauty like Anne’s photos.” “Heart of the Storm,” the Brigman photograph he acquired at an auction — and exhibited here — synthesizes her artistic trademarks. It drove photography purists crazy that she manipulated negatives and prints with tools like a stylus or paint as if using Photoshop. They dismissed these multimedia composites within the fledgling medium as an art form. The exhibit demonstrates her step-by-step process with “Heart of the Storm,” an iconic image of two hamadryads, classical mythology’s tree-huggers, from her recurring cast of Pan and his fellow wood nymphs. Image “The Cleft of the Rock,” circa 1907.CreditThe Michael G. and C. Jane Wilson 2007 Trust “Her hybrids of beautiful women tied to grotesque trees are about pain, suffering and death. Brigman believed that suffering was liberating and the only way to grow,” said Kathleen Pyne, a professor emeritus of art history at the University of Notre Dame and contributor to Ms. Wolfe’s catalog, who recently completed the biography “The Photographer of Enchantment: Anne Brigman.” “Stieglitz wanted more hybrids because of their shock value and thought she had created something completely unique and extraordinary.” No romantic interest has ever been documented, but Brigman, Stieglitz and O’Keeffe were definitely involved in an art triangle. O’Keeffe was floored by Brigman’s work; the former’s paintings of dying junipers are inspired by the latter’s themes of suffering in the natural world, according to Ms. Pyne. Stieglitz had high hopes for Brigman, hosting her in New York with a solo show in mind at his Gallery 291. But, paradoxically, the seasoned adventuress feared becoming lost in the metropolis and got her bearings by imagining skyscrapers as summits along a trail. Stieglitz eventually grew frustrated with her inferior printing technique and with not having enough stellar images to fashion a proper exhibit. She favored gelatin silver bromide before finally learning platinum printing, the Photo-Secession’s accepted process, during her time in New York. She never really fit in with Stieglitz’s salon and city, seeking a breath of fresh air in Maine. He bought into the theories of Havelock Ellis, the founder of modern sexology, that linked artists’ work and their sexuality, particularly concerning female artists. But eroticizing nudes wasn’t her thing. Brigman went back to the West Coast for good, and Stieglitz eventually fulfilled his Pygmalion fantasy with the more compliant O’Keeffe. Image “Via Dolorosa,” circa 1911 and printed circa 1912, gelatin silver print. The photographer said she sought the rhythms of trees and rocks.CreditThe Michael G. and C. Jane Wilson 2007 Trust “Stieglitz is reading into Brigman’s photographs his East Coast brand of modernism, which is very different than her West Coast brand of modernism,” said Ms. Wolfe, the curator, pointing to Brigman’s “The Cleft in the Rock,” a photograph whose prominent gash is reminiscent of O’Keeffe’s flower paintings and often compared to vulvas. Both women artists defended their nonsexual intentions, that sometimes a flower is just a flower, and a tree or rock is also just that. Brigman found other clever ways to thumb her nose at the male establishment. In the exhibit’s photograph “Dawn,” she lounges atop Donner Summit like Édouard Manet’s “Olympia” to revisit the site of Timothy O’Sullivan’s and Carleton Watkins’s hypermasculine photographs. Whereas their references to industrial progress, such as the Transcontinental Railroad, celebrate Manifest Destiny within the age-old conflict of man versus nature, she merely wanted to exist in nature and become one with nature through her body and free spirit. “She places herself in the very foreground of this very iconic vista in the Sierras, and you can see she has manipulated the image in the darkroom to create this idealized representation of female beauty,” Ms. Wolfe said. Confronting Brigman’s remarkable life and poetry — not to mention her spunk and tenacity — can leave visitors teary-eyed, observers at the museum noted. Her contemporary art descendants in the adjacent galleries don’t come close to instilling the same effect. Considering Ms. Strayed’s “Wild” was made into a major motion picture, Ms. Wolfe, the curator, and her colleagues wonder if it’s Brigman’s turn. They’re having fun imagining which actresses would play her in different life stages. “I’m in the movie business, and there just isn’t enough drama,” said Mr. Wilson, the producer. Maybe that was exactly the point. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page AR18 of the New York edition with the headline: In the Sierra Nevadas, Baring Body and Soul.

arts Crown Publisher and Editor of Michelle Obama’s Memoir Is Leaving - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|Crown Publisher and Editor of Michelle Obama’s Memoir Is Leaving Supported by Books News Crown Publisher and Editor of Michelle Obama’s Memoir Is Leaving By Alexandra Alter Dec. 7, 2018 Image Molly Stern is widely regarded within the publishing world for having an eye for both best-selling commercial fiction and award-winning literary fiction and nonfiction.CreditCreditGeorge Baier IV As part of a major shake-up at Penguin Random House, which recently merged two of its biggest publishing divisions — Crown Publishing Group and Random House — Molly Stern, Crown’s senior vice president and publisher, will be leaving the company. Ms. Stern’s departure came on the heels of one of her greatest publishing successes: She was the editor for Michelle Obama’s memoir “Becoming,” which sold more than two million copies in just 15 days after its initial release, making it the best-selling book of 2018. In her acknowledgments, Mrs. Obama wrote that Ms. Stern’s “enthusiasm, energy, and passion instantly drew me to her. Molly kept me buoyed by her unwavering faith in my vision for this book.” Ms. Stern is widely regarded within the publishing world for having an eye for both best-selling commercial fiction and award-winning literary fiction and nonfiction. Under her direction at Crown, the company published blockbusters like Gillian Flynn’s “Gone Girl,” Andy Weir’s “The Martian” and Ernest Cline’s “Ready Player One,” as well as acclaimed nonfiction by best-selling authors such as Susan Cain, Erik Larson and Matthew Desmond, who won the Pulitzer Prize for “Evicted.” Ms. Stern, who realized the book-selling power of social media very early, asked Sarah Jessica Parker to start an imprint at Hogarth, which is part of Crown. Following the announced exit of Maya Mavjee, Crown’s president and publisher, who will leave the company at the end of the year, Ms. Stern is the most prominent executive to leave as a result of the reorganization. David Drake, Crown’s executive vice president and deputy publisher, will replace Ms. Stern. Mr. Drake helped to oversee the global publication strategy for Ms. Obama’s “Becoming,” along with another Crown executive, Tina Constable. Gillian Blake, the editor in chief at Henry Holt, will be joining Crown as the company’s senior vice president and editor in chief of Crown Trade. At Holt, Blake edited such titles as Elizabeth Kolbert’s “The Sixth Extinction” and Tina Brown’s “The Vanity Fair Diaries,” as well as many of Bill O’Reilly’s books. She also tapped TV host and producer Andy Cohen to start his own imprint, Andy Cohen Books, at the company. The changes at Crown reflect a broader cyclical shift in the publishing industry as bigger companies like Penguin Random House and Hachette try to streamline their overlapping imprints after major growth spurts and acquisitions. Many of the country’s biggest publishing houses have added imprints and acquired smaller publishing companies in an effort to stay competitive by getting larger, which gives them more leverage in setting terms with big retailers like Barnes & Noble and Amazon. In 2014, News Corporation bought the romance publisher Harlequin for $415 million, and two years ago, Hachette Book Group struck a deal to acquire Perseus, an independent publishing house, acquiring imprints like Basic Books, Nation Books and PublicAffairs. In 2013, Penguin and Random House merged into a sprawling company, by far the largest of “the big five” publishing houses, which also include Simon & Schuster and Macmillan, Hachette and HarperCollins. The company operates around 275 imprints worldwide, and its sales total around 4 billion annually. Some companies are trying to streamline their operations by combining imprints and publishing lines, or sometimes eliminating imprints all together. Last month, Hachette Book Group announced that Hachette Books would move into the Perseus division, and that Hachette Books’ publisher, Mauro DiPreta, would be leaving the company. When Penguin Random House announced the merger of Crown and Random House in October, many authors and agents wondered what would become of each division’s many imprints, which include Hogarth, Tim Duggan Books, Broadway Books, Ballantine Bantam Dell, Delacorte Press and Spiegel & Grau. In a company memo, Madeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., assured employees that Crown and Random House “will retain their distinct editorial identities.” Follow Alexandra Alter on Twitter: @xanalter.

arts The Best TV Shows of 2018 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|The Best TV Shows of 2018 Supported by The Best TV Shows of 2018 Image The best series of the year included, from left, “The Americans,” with Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell; “Killing Eve,” with Sandra Oh; “Atlanta,” with Lakeith Stanfield and Donald Glover; and “Lodge 49,” with Wyatt Russell.CreditCreditFrom left, FX; BBC America; Guy D'Alema/FX; Jackson Lee Davis/AMC By James Poniewozik, Mike Hale and Margaret Lyons Dec. 3, 2018 阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版 Another year brought another embarrassment of TV riches, as departing favorites gave way to audacious new series, and streaming services brought viewers a world of outstanding foreign fare. Best Shows | Best International | Best New Shows James Poniewozik The Best Shows of 2018 Image Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys in "The Americans."CreditPatrick Harbron/FX TV gets better and better, but it does not necessarily do so in a straight line. The first several months of 2018, I worried I might have a hard time filling this list. The last half of the year, though, came on with a burst of creativity that kept me adding and subtracting to the last minute. This is one reason I don’t rank it in order. I’d be lying if I told you I liked my No. 7 show measurably better than No. 8, and you could make a solid Top 10 out of my near-misses (“Babylon Berlin,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and “Better Call Saul” among them). ‘The Americans’ (FX) You had to know the ending was going to hurt. The final season of this family spy drama with a melancholy heart as big as Mother Russia brought the long con of Elizabeth and Philip Jennings (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) to an end. The devastating, though largely bloodless, finale stayed true to the series’s theme that often the greatest sacrifices you make for a doomed cause are emotional. (Streaming on Amazon and FX Plus.) ‘America to Me’ (Starz) I cringe when critics say, “You have to watch this” — there’s no better way to make TV sound like a chore. But this 10-part documentary, set at a racially integrated school in Oak Park, Ill., was not homework. The sprawling, nuance-minded story explored the difficulties of racial inequity, even in a socially conscious school. But more than that, it was an involving, big-hearted story of kids, their dreams, their challenges, their triumphs and their everyday drama. You don’t have to watch “America to Me.” But you’ll be glad if you do. (Streaming on Starz.) ‘Atlanta Robbin’ Season’ (FX) The second season of “Atlanta” had a theme: money, scams and the precarious struggle of its characters on the periphery of the hip-hop business to hang on to what they have. But this creation by Donald Glover and company also retained its ability to become anything from episode to episode: gothic horror in the episode “Teddy Perkins,” picaresque comedy in “Barbershop” and poignant coming-of-age in “F.U.B.U.” At a peak moment for pop-culture Afro-surrealism (“Random Acts of Flyness” on TV, “Sorry to Bother You” in the theaters), “Atlanta” remained the kingpin. (Streaming on FX Plus.) ‘Barry’ (HBO) and ‘Killing Eve’ (BBC America) Image Bill Hader in “Barry.”CreditHBO I pair these shows together not to cheat an extra show into my list — well, maybe a little bit — but because they’re two sides of a bloody coin. Both are mordant stories about assassins: Barry (Bill Hader), a burned out ex-soldier who longs to become an actor, and Villanelle (Jodie Comer), a gleeful huntress playing cat-and-mouse with an intelligence-agency bureaucrat (Sandra Oh). But beyond the obvious, these two stories show how some of today’s best TV exists in a gray area between genres. “Barry,” a half-hour “comedy” from Hader and Alec Berg, developed into something closer to a melancholy short drama; the creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge infused “Eve” with the brio of a dark comedy, though its hour length marked it as “crime drama.” Label them what you like; each hit its target. (“Barry” is streaming on HBO; “Killing Eve” is streaming on Hulu.) ‘BoJack Horseman’ (Netflix) All things being equal, I prefer not to list the same show two years in a row. (This was the tiebreaker that barely eliminated “The Good Place.”) “BoJack” is a pristine example; after five seasons, it is so perceptive, moving and hilarious that it is easy to imagine it cemented on this list permanently. Threading a nuanced arc about the #MeToo movement with a running joke about a robot built out of household appliances and sex toys, the season solidified this cartoon’s case as the best series ever made for streaming. (Streaming on Netflix.) ‘The Good Fight’ (CBS All Access) The second season of “The Good Fight” was the first great TV response to the election of Donald Trump, which has been marked mostly by a glut of late-night comedy and nostalgia revivals. As the firm of Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) dove into the politics and conflicts of the Trump era — immigration, judicial appointments, #MeToo and a certain rumored Russian-hotel tape — what had been a perfectly decent sequel to “The Good Wife” returned invigorated, absurdist and energized for battle. (Streaming on CBS All Access.) ‘Homecoming’ (Amazon) Image Julia Roberts, left, and Sissy Spacek in “Homecoming.”CreditHilary B Gayle/Amazon This defense-industry conspiracy thriller moved with military efficiency and artistic stealth. Julia Roberts’s first starring role for TV was her best in years, and she turned in an astonishing, finely calibrated performance. Adapting the series from a podcast drama, the director Sam Esmail applied the cinephilic wizardry he honed on “Mr. Robot” to a take on the paranoid thrillers of the ’70s. Best of all, the whole season took a mere 10 half-hour episodes, which flew by but possessed the screen as if they had all the time in the world. (Streaming on Amazon.) ‘Lodge 49’ (AMC) Every year there’s a show or two for which my honest review is: “I can’t describe this. Just watch it.” “Lodge 49” gets to its story eventually, enfolding real estate, surfing and the arcane secrets of alchemy. But this comic-melancholy hangout is most worth watching for its generous portraits of the strivers and losers at and around a fraternal lodge in down-and-out Southern California. Oddball and amiable, “Lodge 49” looked for meaning in sports-bar restaurants and closing aerospace factories, and it found a peculiar magic. (Streaming on AMC.) ‘Pose’ (FX) On the demanding floor of New York’s 1980s ballroom competitions, the judging standard was flawlessness. But to me, moments of transcendence matter more than lack of faults. And in those moments, Ryan Murphy’s resplendent series soared like a plumed miracle. “Pose” had clumsy and oversentimental aspects. But it also had an immediate verve, cut-to-the-bone performances and heart to spare. I’ll probably think of “Pose” more than anything else when I think of 2018 TV, and if that’s not the definition of “best,” then it’s something better. (Streaming on FX Plus.) ‘Sharp Objects’ (HBO) I teetered between this limited series and the excellent “My Brilliant Friend” for what you might call the HBO literary-adaptation slot. “Sharp Objects,” adapted by Marti Noxon from the novel by Gillian Flynn, was the more inventive reimagining for the screen, and thus better TV as TV. Noxon captured the open-wound psyche of Camille Preaker (a wholly committed Amy Adams). The director, Jean-Marc Vallée, created a soundscape and aesthetic that was almost tactile: You could feel the humidity, hear the lazy insects. Few series have done so well at putting you in a protagonist’s mind and in her world. (Streaming on HBO.) Mike Hale The Best International Shows Weimar decadence, Scandi-noir and gentle British comedy. Image Hugh Grant, center, in “A Very English Scandal.”CreditSophie Mutevelian/Blueprint Television The magic number that’s used to scare us these days with regard to the excessive population of scripted television shows is 500. But my research — consisting of poring over my own obsessively maintained lists — indicates that in 2018, the number of new seasons of international shows alone was more than 600. Chinese soap operas and Korean romantic comedies, British conspiracy thrillers, Indian gangster sagas, moody Scandinavian ghost stories, Mexican melodramas, Spanish crime capers, French children’s shows and Japanese anime — the only bar to entry is how many TV and streaming subscriptions you’re willing to spring for. The other issue is time, of course. The shows on the following list are my 10 favorites among the relatively small share of international series I was able to sample. Please use the comments to fill in the gaps with your own picks. (Before you ask, “The Crown” didn’t have a new season in 2018.) 1. ‘A Very English Scandal’ (Amazon) Hugh Grant takes the self-effacing charm that’s served him so well in romantic comedy and turns it inside out in this insouciant, scathing historical dramedy written by Russell T. Davies and directed by Stephen Frears. Grant is both magnificently creepy and oddly poignant as the British politician Jeremy Thorpe, brought down by scandal in the late 1970s, and Ben Whishaw is also outstanding as Norman Josiffe, Thorpe’s ex-lover, who refused to go away quietly. (Streaming on Amazon.) 2. ‘The Bridge’ (Hulu) The fourth and final season of this Scandi-noir bellwether was, like the first three, complicated, spine-tingling, a little over the top and occasionally quite funny (in the studiously deadpan Nordic manner). It went beyond them in finally unraveling the tormented history of the Swedish super-cop Saga Noren (Sofia Helin), and it provided her with a valedictory moment that was inevitable (if you had watched the whole series) but still devastating. (Streaming on Hulu.) 3. ‘The End of the ____ing World’ (Netflix) Adapting a graphic novel by Charles S. Forsman, the British actress and writer Charlie Covell takes the delinquent-teenagers-on-the-run story and makes it both more outré and more delicate than we’re accustomed to. Jessica Barden and Alex Lawther play a budding nihilist and an aspiring psychopath who meet dark (he’s looking for a first victim and she’ll do) and hit the roads of northern England in a stolen car, discovering that the adult world can be a colder place than even they could imagine. (Streaming on Netflix.) 4. ‘Babylon Berlin’ (Netflix) It’s “Law & Order: Weimar Republic,” in a German series (one of its writer-directors is Tom Tykwer of “Run Lola Run”) that combines the nitty-gritty satisfactions of the crime drama with the more voluptuous pleasures of “Cabaret”-style decadence and foreboding. Volker Bruch and Liv Lisa Fries are both excellent, he as a vice cop trying to hide the symptoms of shell shock and she as a sometime clerk for the homicide department who wants to be a detective, but in the meantime has to work as a prostitute to cover the rent. (Streaming on Netflix.) 5. ‘Detectorists’ (AcornTV) Image Toby Jones, left, and Mackenzie Crook in “Detectorists.”CreditBBC/Acorn TV The last season of Mackenzie Crook’s beautiful miniaturist comedy — hushed but never too gentle — found the metal detectorists Andy and Lance (Crook and the peerless Toby Jones) racing the clock. Their access to a promising empty field was threatened by a solar-energy company’s plans, and magpies kept carrying away the Roman coins they found there. Less time was spent with the quirky members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, but the trade-off was more time with loved ones and family members crisply played by Rebecca Callard, Rachael Stirling and Diana Rigg. (Streaming on Acorn TV.) 6. ‘Money Heist’ (Netflix) Properly titled “La Casa de Papel,” or House of Paper, Alex Pina’s caper story (two seasons totaling 22 episodes were released on Netflix) is a joy ride in every sense. A mastermind recruits and trains eight accomplices to hit the Spanish mint, and the protracted but breathless narrative generously accommodates a sharply drawn cast of thieves, cops, relatives and eventually hostages. (Streaming on Netflix.) 7. ‘Unforgotten’ (PBS) and ‘The Split’ (Sundance TV) Nicola Walker is everywhere in British TV (six-episode seasons help), and she’s always good. She was at the center of each of these series, as a quietly compassionate cold-case cop in the first and as a quietly angry divorce lawyer with her own marital and family issues in the second. “Unforgotten,” created by Chris Lang for ITV, is melancholic and deliberate while “The Split,” created by Abi Morgan for BBC, is biting and fast-paced. Both are intelligent and thoroughly imagined — they’re melodramas with no artificial aftertaste. (“Unforgotten” is streaming on PBS and Amazon; “The Split” is streaming on Sundance Now.) 8. ‘A Place Further Than the Universe’ (Crunchyroll) A high-spirited, jokey anime series about four teenage girls who join a scientific expedition to Japan’s Antarctic research station might sound like a show with a pretty specific audience. But “A Place,” written by Jukki Hanada and directed by Atsuko Ishizuka, is a funny and moving coming-of-age story that should translate across all boundaries of age or culture. Never mawkish or contrived, it’s an absolutely authentic depiction of how friendship can overcome adolescent anxiety and grief. (Streaming on Crunchyroll.) 9. ‘Manon 5 Years On’ (Walter Presents) Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, known for the true-crime documentary series “The Staircase,” directed this proletarian slice-of-life mini-series for the French network Arte. It and its predecessor, “Three Times Manon,” are both available from the Euro-drama streaming service Walter Presents. Across the two series’s six hours, Alba Gaïa Bellugi draws you in and pulls you along as the raging, suspicious and at first barely articulate Manon. In “5 Years On” she’s 20 and recently released from reform school, holding down a job at an auto shop and discovering a hunger for, and terror of, romance. (Streaming on Walter Presents.) 10. ‘Howards End’ (Starz) Among the year’s British literary adaptations, this mini-series based on the E.M. Forster novel edges out “The Woman in White” and “A Child in Time” on PBS. Matthew Macfadyen captured the dignity, kindness and obstinacy of the businessman Henry Wilcox; Hayley Atwell and Philippa Coulthard gave engaging, intelligent readings of the highly principled Schlegel sisters (though it was hard not to judge them against the memorable performances of Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter in the 1992 film). But the real star of the four-part series was Kenneth Lonergan’s brisk and lucid screenplay. (Streaming on Starz.) Margaret Lyons The Best New Shows Top debuts included addictive thrillers and nihilistic satires. Image Jodie Comer, left, and Sandra Oh in "Killing Eve."CreditBBC America Even though Peak TV shows no real signs of actually peaking, this wasn’t a banner year for new shows — most of the year’s standouts were veteran series. There were hundreds of premieres, which often felt like thousands of premieres, which is why no one person can possibly watch it all. I know I’ve missed some great shows in the last 12 months. All I can say is I’ve caught some great ones, too, and these were the freshmen that stood out. 1. ‘Barry’ (HBO) and ‘Killing Eve’ (BBC America) I’m cheating a little, but these shows debuted within weeks of each other and created an unintentional but wonderful assassin double feature. Each successfully tweaked its ostensible genre’s tone — “Killing Eve” bringing glam, humor and humanity to the often grim espionage thriller, and “Barry” adding icy violence and a sense of true danger and surprise to the showbiz black-comedy genre. And both shows included career-defining performances from actors whose careers were already pretty well defined: Sandra Oh earned her first lead actress Emmy nomination for “Eve,” and Bill Hader and Henry Winkler each won their first acting Emmys for their work on “Barry.” 3. ‘Lodge 49’ (AMC) The dreamy-surfy “Lodge 49” has arguably the best casting of any series on this list. A show this gentle and diffuse only works if all the performances have a strong gravitational pull, and the show lives and dies on Wyatt Russell’s ability to give the dopey but loyal Dud enough grounding. Luckily Russell’s terrific, as is the rest of the cast — especially Brent Jennings as Ernie, Dud’s mentor in the show’s fictional fraternal order, and Sonya Cassidy as Liz, Dud’s twin sister who’s been handling the family’s affairs since their dad died. “Lodge 49” has a radiant internal decency, one that respects its characters’ sometimes silly quests because it’s a series that knows trying new things is hard but worth it. 4. ‘America to Me’ (Starz) I’m counting this as a full-on show and not a mini-series because at 10 episodes it feels and moves like a regular series, and also because I hope there’s another season someday. The show comes from the director Steve James (“Hoop Dreams”) and follows a handful of students through a school year at Oak Park and River Forest High School, which prides itself on its diversity. But racism pulses through the school’s veins in overt and covert ways, as acutely observed in this intimate and memorable documentary. 5. ‘Queer Eye’ (Netflix) Image The new version of “Queer Eye,” on Netflix, was based in Atlanta.CreditNetflix Because this is a reboot — new cast, new setting — and not a revival, it qualifies as a new show. And because it’s loving, interesting and jubilant, it qualifies as one of the best new shows. The new Fab Five, based out of Atlanta, give makeovers to deserving individuals and emotional sustenance to viewers. There were two seasons of the show in 2018, and the second is superior, but both have an earnestness and positivity that are a welcome respite from the grinding misery of life. (Streaming on Netflix.) 6. ‘You’ (Lifetime) I ripped through the 10 episodes of “You” like a fiend, like it was salt and vinegar chips, like it was Christmas morning, like I had rabies. It’s that fun and that addictive — and that close to the edge of being straight-up trashy. Instead, the drama about a bookstore manager stalking an MFA student is a savvy sendup of social media culture (well, “culture”) and New York nonsense, packaged in a tight thriller with a gloriously nasty sense of humor. (Streaming on Lifetime.) 7. ‘Sorry for Your Loss’ (Facebook Watch) TV is not great at depicting grief. Usually shows race through the mourning period, never mention dead characters again and don’t acknowledge the looping nature of despair and the permanence of profound loss. Then there’s this show, which … does. Elizabeth Olsen’s portrayal of a young widow is prickly and real, and the characters around her are all dealing with their own lives in addition to supporting her through her trauma. There’s only so much support anyone can give, and that anyone can accept. (Streaming on Facebook.) 8. ‘Corporate’ (Comedy Central) The latest entry in the terrible workplace genre, “Corporate” is as nihilistic as they come, so bleak it often becomes absurd and even supernatural. Because the corporation at the heart of “Corporate” is so large — their slogan is “We don’t make anything, we make everything” — the characters have no respite from their overlords, and even weekends, parties and restaurants are tinged with office-adjacent misery. Because many people will experience work drudgery in their lives, shows or movies about it are better when they’re surgically specific in their critiques — and “Corporate” is. (Streaming on Comedy Central.) 9. ‘Cupcake and Dino: General Services’ (Netflix) Warning: This show has the catchiest theme song maybe ever, all the more dangerous because its lyrics are just the name of the show, so every time you mention “Cupcake and Dino,” it’s an invitation to just sing the song. This gleeful cartoon about two brothers who take on odd jobs all over their town of Big City is reminiscent of “Adventure Time,” but a little more wild and silly. (Streaming on Netflix.) 10. ‘Pose’ (FX) Ryan Murphy’s ensemble drama set within the drag world of 1980s New York knows how to balance its sad side with its soapy side with its fun side with its human side. It’s a show about allegiance and community, about characters who have found one another on the fringes and made a life and a world for themselves. read more about our favorite shows of the year In ‘The Americans’ Finale, the Deepest Cuts Don’t Leave a MarkMay 30, 2018 Review: ‘Lodge 49,’ Where Beautiful Losers Join the ClubAug. 3, 2018 Review: In ‘Killing Eve,’ Female Spy Hunts Female AssassinApril 5, 2018 On That ‘Barry’ Finale and Why Some Shows Are So Good, They Need to EndMay 13, 2018 Review: ‘America to Me’ Is a Searing Lesson in School InequityAug. 24, 2018 A Tale of Two Netflix Coming-of-Age ComediesFeb. 15, 2018 For Hugh Grant, a Smaller Screen Brings a More Complex RoleJune 22, 2018 James Poniewozik is the chief television critic.

arts New in Paperback: ‘Elastic,’ ‘Brass’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|New in Paperback: ‘Elastic,’ ‘Brass’ Supported by New in Paperback: ‘Elastic,’ ‘Brass’ Image By Joumana Khatib Jan. 4, 2019 Six new paperbacks to check out this week. ELASTIC: UNLOCKING YOUR BRAIN’S ABILITY TO EMBRACE CHANGE, by Leonard Mlodinow. (Vintage, $16.) Our capacity to stretch beyond the bounds of our preconceptions and other deeply held beliefs, what Mlodinow calls “elastic thinking,” is essential to innovation, creativity and independent thought. He offers an engaging guide to the brain’s power to solve new problems, weaving together scientific research, politics and literature. BRASS, by Xhenet Aliu. (Random House, $17.) Elsie and Lulu, the mother and daughter whose potent relationship forms the core of this debut novel, are desperate to leave behind their hardscrabble lives. As our reviewer, Julie Buntin, put it, the book “offers a reminder that assumptions — whether about a place, or a person as close to you as your mother — never tell the full story.” THE WINE LOVER’S DAUGHTER: A MEMOIR, by Anne Fadiman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.) In her study of her father, the literary critic Clifton Fadiman, the author uses his infatuation with wine to explore the motivations that guide connoisseurship and hedonism. Though Fadiman does not share her father’s ardent love of the drink, her wine-focused vignettes sketch a portrait of their complicated relationship. MACBETH, by Jo Nesbo. Translated by Don Bartlett. (Hogarth Shakespeare, $16.) In his reimagining of Shakespeare’s tragedy, the Norwegian crime writer draws out the play’s noir elements, transposing its moral choices and plot to 1970s Glasgow as the city strained under corruption, violence and addiction. Our reviewer, James Shapiro, praised the adaptation, calling the book “a dark but ultimately hopeful ‘Macbeth,’ one suited to our own troubled times, in which ‘the slowness of democracy’ is no match for power-hungry strongmen.” THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE: CONFESSIONS OF A NUCLEAR WAR PLANNER, by Daniel Ellsberg. (Bloomsbury, $18.) Ellsberg, best known as the former military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers, makes an impassioned call for reducing the risk of nuclear destruction. Though widespread fears about nuclear war have largely receded since the end of the Cold War in 1991, Ellsberg argues that there’s plenty of reason for concern. TANGERINE, by Christine Mangan. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $16.99.) Alice and Lucy were once close college friends, and a dark episode from those years haunts their reconciliation in Morocco. In a novel that borrows from Paul Bowles and Patricia Highsmith, the two characters, neither of them a trustworthy narrator, get caught up in a mysterious disappearance in Tangier.

arts Seeing the Art World Through Personal and Political Lenses - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|Seeing the Art World Through Personal and Political Lenses Supported by Books of The Times Seeing the Art World Through Personal and Political Lenses Image Nell PainterCreditCreditJohn Emerson By Jennifer Szalai June 20, 2018 When the historian Nell Irvin Painter decided to leave a chaired professorship at Princeton to go to art school — embracing a new field and a new life at the age of 64 — it wasn’t so much the art part that baffled people as the school part. Art sounded like freedom; school sounded like drudgery. If she wanted to paint, why not simply retire and devote her days to painting? Why endure a crowded commute from her home in Newark to sweat it out with 18-year-olds for the minor distinction (for her) of yet another undergraduate degree? In her candid and cheerfully irreverent new book, “Old in Art School: A Memoir of Starting Over,” Painter says she never really questioned her decision to go back to school. For a black woman with an already formidable formal education, more formal education was a no-brainer. “Institutions conferred not simply knowledge, but also the means to be seen,” she writes of her decision to enroll in the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University. Painter had spent enough time observing how power works to know that individual toil was no match for stubborn prejudice or oblivious indifference. “My personal worth in art, again, my old, academic, black self, would need all the institutional support it could gather.” Image CreditSonny Figueroa/The New York Times If you were looking for a term that sounds about as creative and tantalizing as a dental appointment, “institutional support” might be it. Painter, though, will make you think again. The same goes for the critic Aruna D’Souza, whose “Whitewalling: Art, Race & Protest in 3 Acts” also takes on issues of power and inclusion. Painter’s generous book is loose and freewheeling, while D’Souza’s ice-pick critique is pointed and direct; both volumes are generative, bringing new energy and insight to questions that have long preoccupied the art world. As Painter puts it: “What counts as art? Who is an artist? Who decides?” Painter gets more playful with these questions than she initially lets on. One of the most enjoyable aspects of “Old in Art School” is seeing her relax her historian’s grip on social meaning and open up to new ways of seeing. She became fascinated by process, copying the paintings of others in her own hand to discover how, for example, Max Beckmann delineated the distorted lines in a self-portrait, and how Alice Neel painted the artist Faith Ringgold’s dark skin. Painter derived a great deal of pleasure from the sensuousness of art supplies. Her “lying 20th-century eyes favored craft, clarity, skill, narrative and meaning,” but she learned that everyday subjects, including things she had previously deemed too ordinary, too confessional or too intimate, made for totally legitimate material. “Nowadays,” she says slyly, “even I contemplate making penis art.” Which isn’t to say that she loses sight of the art world — or The Art World, as she occasionally, and only somewhat facetiously, puts it. She quickly learned that school wasn’t an idyll or a refuge; if anything it was a hothouse, especially at the Rhode Island School of Design, also known as RISD, where she decided to pursue a graduate art degree. The timing of her application to RISD seemed strange, if not awful. Her nonagenarian mother, out in the Bay Area, was dying; her nonagenarian father, struggling with depression, kept weeping on the phone. Painter was still in her last year at Mason Gross and also happened to be finishing her seventh book, “The History of White People” (2010), which she refers to by the delightful acronyms “THWP” and “MFB” (M for “my” and B for “book”; you can figure out the rest). When she talked to people about graduate school, everyone told her not to bother. So of course she had to, “with a conviction born of defiance.” At RISD, her initial euphoria turned to gnawing self-doubt, when a bad experience with a student monitor and some deflating critiques sent her spiraling. She had to seek encouragement elsewhere, outside the school. Her (mostly white) peers and teachers stared at her work, often uncomprehendingly. When she recommended a bell hooks essay to a fellow student, he demurred. “He couldn’t relate to it, because the author was black. (Gasp!)” “My definition of personal, my sense of myself as an individual, was too tied up in notions of blackness for the others to care,” she writes. “I never felt animus from them, just an assumption of my inconsequence and, sometimes when they focused on me, their inability — a good-natured inability, it must be said — to say very much about my work.” In “Whitewalling,” D’Souza says that museums and galleries (the “white walls” of her title) might often mean well, but the inadequacy of good intentions is part of her point. She focuses on three controversies that roiled the art world over the decades — including, most recently, the exhibition of “Open Casket,” Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till, in the 2017 Whitney Biennial — to explore how artists and curators have handled issues of race and artistic freedom. D’Souza’s book is less about aesthetics than protest. Her politics are unequivocally radical. But she also sees how art has been expected to wield an almost supernatural power to extinguish fires that it didn’t create: “We both give art too much credit and place an undue burden on it when we imagine that it can interrupt or overturn such pervasive systems of power as white supremacy or capitalism.” Image Aruna D'SouzaCreditDana Hoey Reading D’Souza on how curation works can be clarifying. She’s excellent on “the censorial function of curating itself,” which might value “ambiguity, open-endedness, even dissension” on the one hand, but will always — by definition — entail some form of exclusion on the other. She also shows how predominantly white institutions, even those identifying as transgressive or avant-garde, have historically “sucked moments of black protest back” onto their terms. At under 150 pages, “Whitewalling” is a laser beam of a book, unwavering and on target. “Old in Art School” is more meandering, pleasingly and profoundly so, as Painter negotiates the artist she’s becoming: not identical with her historian self, but not running away from it either. “I was losing my reverence for coherence,” Painter writes at one point. And at another: “Don’t ask me to resolve the contradiction.” At the end of this memoir, she resolves “not to see myself through other people’s eyes,” and to trust her own more. It took her six years of art school and six decades of life, but she emerged with a growing body of work as well as a measure of self-acceptance — which, in a world full of bias and blind spots, can be the hardest thing to learn.

arts Two Leading Intellectuals Analyze What Ails America - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Two Leading Intellectuals Analyze What Ails America Supported by Nonfiction Two Leading Intellectuals Analyze What Ails America Image CreditCreditGabriel Alcala By Norman J. Ornstein Dec. 7, 2018 THE POLITICS OF PETULANCE America in an Age of Immaturity By Alan Wolfe 210 pp. The University of Chicago Press. $25. AMERICA, COMPROMISED By Lawrence Lessig 251 pp. The University of Chicago Press. $24. Among President Trump’s major accomplishments is the booming industry in books about him, his administration, the state of democracy in America, the rise of autocracy in America and abroad, the reasons for his rise, the bases of his support, the state of the Republican Party, the state of his mental health or lack thereof, the chaos in his White House and so on. Not all are strictly about Trump — the fact is the conditions and dynamics that brought us Trump long preceded him, and the changes in the fabric of our Republic are paralleled by changes in other longstanding democracies around the globe. Two of the nation’s top public intellectuals are adding to this expansive genre with short books designed for broad audiences. Neither is fundamentally about Trump; indeed, one barely mentions the president. But both are about the America that Trump’s ascent now typifies. Alan Wolfe, a distinguished professor emeritus at Boston College and prolific scholar of American political thought, gives us “The Politics of Petulance: America in an Age of Immaturity.” “America, Compromised” is by Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, the former head of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and an activist on campaign finance. Wolfe’s is two books in one: first, a polemic, aimed at Trump and his supporters, and at the broader fabric of our age; second, a brief intellectual history of modern America. He sets his frame early on: “It is … not an explanation of one rogue election we need. It is a discussion of what kind of nation we have become.” To get there, Wolfe focuses intensely on the so-called McCarthy era, the period in the 1950s when Senator Joseph McCarthy used deception, lies and demagogy to create an atmosphere of fear and division. Wolfe draws some parallels with today’s Trump era (beyond those of fear, division and deception, there is a direct link: McCarthy’s henchman Roy Cohn became Trump’s Svengali). But his book is less about McCarthy or his tactics and more about the views of a swath of political thinkers and public intellectuals who arose in that era to take on the ideas that made McCarthyism a threat to our democracy. Wolfe describes and examines a host of postwar political thinkers, many of whom, like Hannah Arendt and Joseph Schumpeter, had come from the horrors of Europe, but he focuses even more on a core group of American-born intellectuals like Richard Hofstadter, Daniel Bell, Lionel Trilling, Nathan Glazer, Irving Kristol, Seymour Martin Lipset and Reinhold Niebuhr, those he calls “mature liberals.” They set out the values and behaviors that embody what Wolfe views as political maturity, taking on both the world-government left and the populist, demagogic right. Wolfe is at his best when he is discussing these writers, first-class thinkers who responded powerfully to their era’s challenges. He contrasts their response to what he sees as the lamer reaction of the contemporary intellectual community to Trump — and suggests we no longer have a core of all-star intellectuals but instead a shallower group of “thought leaders.” And he tries to draw lessons from the writing of the old school of mature liberals to apply to the present day, a time, he says, when our political immaturity has led to the politics of petulance. The intellectuals Wolfe admires made a case for the appreciation of subtlety, ambiguity, intellectual curiosity and tolerance of divergent views — all qualities that are abundant in the world of thought but have never been cherished by the broader electorate. As he points out, James Bryce wrote 130 years ago, “The ordinary American voter does not object to mediocrity.” Image Wolfe notes, of course, that McCarthyism lost, which he attributes in large part to the eloquent and sustained pushback from these public intellectuals (although he stresses that it had taken the horrors of a depression and a huge war to remind liberals of their calling and responsibility). He lays out the conditions that led to our current crisis, but implies that these days we have neither the impetus from horrific conditions nor the intellectual heft to transcend Trump and Trumpism and to move beyond our current “immature democracy.” Certainly, there are reasons this era is different, but blaming a lack of intellectual heft both overemphasizes the importance of intellectuals and largely dismisses a pretty impressive collection of present-day thinkers, including many of the Never-Trumpers calling for a reassertion of conservative values from the right, and scholars of political thought, race and authoritarianism showing courage and fortitude from the center and left. He also does not give enough emphasis to other conditions: the rise of partisanship extending even to the courts, the importance of tribal media in a new communications age, the obliteration of campaign finance rules that had put some limits on the power of the oligarchic class. Focused as he is on ideas, Wolfe does not end with a series of reforms to reverse our decline. Instead, he offers advice to his readers: Don’t be petulant, appreciate the nobility of politics, trust experts, avoid conspiracy theorizing, don’t believe candidates who promise only good news, pay attention to political debates, be sensitive to norms and not just laws. All good ideas, but Wolfe has no road map or magic wand to get most Americans to buy into them. “America, Compromised” is about the country in the Trump era, but not about Trump. Indeed, Lessig would have written much the same book if Hillary Clinton were president and if Democrats had control of both houses of Congress. His focus is not on bad people doing bad things, but on how incentives across a range of institutions have created corruption, with deleterious consequences for the nation. Anyone who has seen Lessig’s mesmerizing TED Talk about Congress and political money knows the basis for this book, now extended to discuss a wider range of institutions, including finance, the media, the medical profession, the academy and the law. All of them, he says, have become corrupted by norms and misplaced incentives that in turn corrupt the behavior of actors who are themselves operating not out of venality but are caught in institutional webs. The rest of us? We inflict the greatest harm on society because we enable them. For Congress, Lessig notes that the framers were deeply concerned about corruption, but rarely focused on the evils of individual quid pro quos. They worried about institutions, the danger of politicians becoming dependent on forces beyond the voters who elected them — or, as Madison wrote, “the people alone.” Congress, Lessig believes, is corrupt even though the overwhelming majority of congresspeople are not. The institutional corruption here comes from political money. It corrupts the agenda, the issues that get the focus and attention, and moves Congress away from the needs and concerns of the voters. While our political institutions were not all or mainly linked to voters, at least not directly, the House of Representatives is and was meant to be a channel for the voices of the people. It has become something else entirely. Similarly, Lessig’s chapter on the media, in which he examines technology meeting market forces, reinforces the sense of dysfunction that flows from distorted incentives. One need only look at Facebook for a current example. Image With regard to finance, Lessig examines in different ways the 2008 collapse, from banks to ratings agencies that gave AAA ratings to entities that were absurdly dangerous. These agencies were created in the 19th century, and have had impeccable reputations because of their perceived independence and objectivity. But, Lessig says, the big three ratings agencies, designated as official by the Securities and Exchange Commission, compete to get the lucrative business of analyzing securities. Good ratings mean more business. Bad ratings, not so much. With financial institutions playing one agency off against the others, the results were predictable. Lessig quotes Roger Lowenstein, the author of a book on Wall Street: “Imagine the big rating agencies as three competitive saloons standing side by side, with each free to set its own drinking age. Before long, 9-year-olds would be downing bourbon.” The ratings failures were key contributors to the financial collapse. Individuals in the agencies did not take bribes — it was the perverse incentives that corrupted the institutions. In his essay on the academy, Lessig first writes scathingly of the psychiatric profession. In the era of miracle medications promising relief or cures, psychiatry has become captive to the pharmaceutical industry, altering the ways diseases have been classified and drugs prescribed. Other parts of the academic world have been corrupted as well, Lessig writes, with experts as hired guns who are now paid to testify. What’s more, legislation sponsored by the Democrat Birch Bayh and the Republican Bob Dole and passed in 1980 was intended to encourage academics to bring their research to the marketplace. But giving financial incentives to the academics for their work meant both more commercialism at public expense and more reasons for scientists to keep their findings secret, hindering the free exchange of research findings. Some of Lessig’s toughest words are for his own profession, the law. Lawyers used to prosecute white-collar crime, without partisanship or other biases. But somehow, in the aftermath of the catastrophic financial crisis in 2008, not a single individual miscreant was brought to the bar of justice. Why? Start with the fact that the gap between the incomes of prosecutors and lawyers in firms has ballooned; a prosecutor now struggles for a good life relative to his or her law school colleagues in the private sector. That has led to a revolving door between prosecutors’ offices and white-collar defense firms. Being “hirable” means public officials can’t be too hard on firms they might eventually join. It is not a matter of greed, but of distorted incentives leading to unsettling behavior. What to do? Lessig examines a range of ways to de-corrupt institutions. As with so many efforts, it is hard to find remedies that are realistic and practical. Still, some of Lessig’s ideas are not just pie in the sky. He recommends public financing for campaigns; delinking rating agencies and experts offering testimony from those paying for it; and using in-depth polls to gauge public opinion on key issues as a kind of shadow government. That two impressive public intellectuals like Alan Wolfe and Lawrence Lessig are weighing in on the challenges of our times, joining so many others, is reassuring. “The Politics of Petulance” and “America, Compromised” join an impressive array of books and essays that may, someday, have a future intellectual historian using them as examples to lament the fact that his or her contemporaries are not as eloquent or important as the group that arose in the Trump era to combat the threats to our way of life.

arts Turning the ‘Curse of Ham’ Into a Blessing - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|Turning the ‘Curse of Ham’ Into a Blessing Supported by Essay Turning the ‘Curse of Ham’ Into a Blessing Image CreditCreditMelinda Beck By Julian Lucas Jan. 7, 2019 Hexes and jinxes, maledictions, imprecations, anathema, damnation, fukú. Avada Kedavra, cursed be Canaan, Macbeth, “good luck” and screw you. Curses are versatile fictions, foundational to myth and literature, to the power of speech acts and religious taboos, even to national and ethnic identity. In some stories, they are the handicaps that mark future heroes — like the lame legs of Sundiata Keita, legendary “Lion King” of Mali, or Harry Potter’s lightning scar. In others, they are instruments of divine comeuppance, like the boulder of Sisyphus or the mark of Cain. The main requirement is to endow misfortune with narrative and moral significance, if not always with a corresponding sense of justice or proportion. In Charles Perrault’s original “Sleeping Beauty,” the prick of a spindle is enough to send the princess off to her 100-year slumber. Pandora merely opens a box. The curse has no concept of limited liability; a single transgression can quickly swell into a lasting stigma. Tertullian used Eve’s disobedience to slander women as “the devil’s gateway,” and Byzantine persecutors popularized the idea that God smote Sodom and Gomorrah — cities once thought guilty of inhospitality — for homosexuality. Perhaps the most opaque curse in the Bible, which Noah pronounced on his son Ham, has proved one of its most destructive. Noah, lying hungover and naked in his tent, awakens to realize that Ham has glimpsed him in this state, and, in an unaccountable fit of rage, damns Ham’s son Canaan and his lineage to perpetual servitude. The passage makes no reference to Africa, but centuries of Muslim, Jewish and Christian commentators have tethered Ham’s curse to blackness, thereby justifying slavery from the plantations of the Deep South to the salt mines of the Sahara. If theology often sharpens curses to dogmatic points, great novels can transform them into open-ended questions, unsettling easy pieties about cause and effect, past and present, crime and punishment. Toni Morrison’s novel “Beloved,” the story of a formerly enslaved woman’s confrontation with the infant she killed, moved a generation to reckon with slavery’s intimate violence and its enduring legacy. The fukú of Junot Díaz’s novel “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” — a curse brought to the New World by Columbus — gave new dimension to the deep interconnectedness of American histories, weaving a rich tangle of science fiction, Caribbean politics and family lore around the tragicomic life of a Dominican nerd in New Jersey. The narrator of “Oscar Wao” dubs his tale a “counterspell,” an apt description of storytelling’s power to reverse (or at least reverse-engineer) the vector of fate. What seems like a curse might also be a birthright, a special form of insight, a destiny. Four recent books by African women writers turn curse narratives to historically restorative ends. Reclaiming the device from essentializing myths — a “cursed” gender, a “cursed” continent — they ask what function curses play in the manufacture of histories, families, villages and nations, simultaneously paying homage to the ostracized. These are tales of the “curse” as universal warning and hard-earned insight; as means of giving redemptive shape to suffering; as latent superpower and catalyst to solidarity. Ancestral curses often “explain” a group’s essential character. But a 2017 novel by the Ugandan writer Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi inverts that conceit: What if a curse expressed all the ways that families, cities and nations fail to cohere? This is the question posed by KINTU (Transit Books, paper, $16.95), a sweeping portrait of Ugandan history that begins with the fall of a powerful clan in the 18th century and follows the family’s line through the 21st. The novel, like Genesis, is an origin story; it takes its title from the name of Buganda mythology’s “first man.” Makumbi’s original sinner is the nobleman Kintu Kidda, a beleaguered patriarch consumed by his diplomatic, military and conjugal responsibilities. He serves a bloodthirsty monarch and governs a recently conquered borderland, which he tours in a never-ending circuit of visits to his auxiliary wives. (Makumbi has called the novel “masculinist”; among its great strengths is her attention to the performative burdens patriarchy imposes on men.) Kintu often feels like “a seed dispenser … a slave to procreation and to the kingdom,” but at home, his problems are worse than sexual overcommitment. Married to estranged twins — he loves one; tradition makes the other obligatory — he struggles to command a family that simmers with resentments, rivalries, deceptions and internal contradictions. In Genesis, Ham sins against his father, Noah. In “Kintu,” the patriarch himself is culpable, and the crime is negligence. It begins when Kintu accidentally kills his adopted son and conceals the incident from the boy’s biological father, a Rwandan Tutsi living at the fringes of the community. When the man finds out, he curses Kintu, precipitating a chain of domestic tragedies that afflicts the clan for generations. In the chapters that follow, Makumbi traces the fallout in the lives of Kintu’s modern descendants. Image CreditMelinda Beck Though she ironically alludes to Ham in an epigraph from the 19th-century explorer John Hanning Speke — “I profess accurately to describe naked Africa … a striking existing proof of the Holy Scriptures” — the joke is how thoroughly her novel snubs his Victorian myopia. “Kintu” pointedly omits the colonial period, and with it the narrative of Europe in Africa that has dominated so much of the continent’s literature. Neither Ham’s nor Africa’s, “Kintu”’s curse grounds a fundamental inquiry into the making and unmaking of families, the negotiation of boundaries and roles and the perpetual question of who — whether in a clan or a country — really belongs. Writing with the assurance and wry omniscience of an easygoing deity, Makumbi watches her protagonists live out invariably provisional answers. They are pagans and Christians, vagabonds and military generals, newspaper columnists and victims of H.I.V. Some are looking for families, like the orphan girl vying for her neighbors’ charity in a crowded Kampala boardinghouse. Others are in flight from relatives, like the elderly Christian missionary nostalgic for British rule. Named Kanani (or “Canaan”), he believes that faith will save him from the family curse and spends his days proselytizing at captive commuters: “The church was like a bus and brethren were passengers on their way to heaven rather than a family.” None quite manage to escape or fulfill their appointed roles; when “Kintu”’s carnival of clans, royal courts, Kampala apartments and church groups concludes, it is hardly clearer what form “family” might take, or how individuals should reconcile themselves to kinship. There is, nevertheless, a beauty to how Makumbi’s characters improvise alternatives to what they do not have or cannot be. In one characteristically tender and comic moment, a young man without a father looks for a surrogate to negotiate with a school’s headmaster over a scholarship. His roommate obliges, and finds himself so caught up in the charade that he sheds prideful tears at his “son”’s test results. Dressed for the meeting in a pinstripe suit that makes him resemble “a broke black gangster from an American film,” he boasts and blusters with a parent’s loving obstinacy. It may be a curse that families never “work,” but it is surely a blessing that they can always be reinvented. If Makumbi’s Kintus are cursed like Cain, the heroes of Wayétu Moore’s SHE WOULD BE KING (Graywolf Press, $26) are cursed like Storm, Wolverine and Professor X. The Liberian-American writer’s debut novel is a Marvelesque national epic about Liberia’s independence centered on three supernaturally gifted misfits. The leader is Gbessa, an immortal girl expelled as a witch by her indigenous Vai people, who finds shelter among the black American settlers of Monrovia. (The American Colonization Society, an antebellum organization dedicated to resettling African-Americans in West Africa, established Liberia in 1821. The country declared independence in 1847.) Gbessa joins forces with two other renegades: a magically invincible plantation runaway from Virginia and a Jamaican maroon with the ability to disappear. These newcomers patrol the coast like abolitionist avengers, superpowering their way through every coffle and barracoon they encounter. Meanwhile, in the ballrooms of Monrovia, Gbessa uneasily assimilates into the Americo-Liberian settler elite. The trio’s powers — immortality, for Africa’s antiquity; invisibility, for maroon cunning; invincibility for the endurance of enslaved African-Americans — allegorize the diasporic strands united by the country’s history: Who needs Wakanda when Liberia already has it all? The varied and frenetic action makes for a novel that, while stimulating, is often confusing and overstuffed. Some sections read like folk tales or adventure novels, while those set in Virginia serve up reheated plantation melodrama. “She Would Be King” shows greater originality when Moore dissects Monrovia’s social world. Patronized by Americo-Liberian ladies who see themselves less as fellow Africans than as a civilizing vanguard, Gbessa negotiates a double exclusion that only intensifies once she marries the settlers’ military chief. A conflict between the new arrivals and her estranged kin forces her into the role of mediator, brokering a hybrid identity for Africa’s first republic. Few novelists have explored the singular relationship between Liberia’s black settlers, for whom “returning” to Africa was a form of deliverance from American white supremacy, and the indigenous people who fell under their dominion. Moore’s sophisticated treatment of this encounter showcases her novelistic talents, though the tension somewhat dissipates when the “real” enemies arrive: The complex dance of nation-building gives way to a Garveyite battle royale pitting the reconciled settlers and natives against French slavers who attack Monrovia. The triangular trade did not always unify those menaced by its advance. SEASON OF THE SHADOW (Seagull Books, $24.50), a novel by the Cameroonian writer Léonora Miano, considers slavery from the perspective of its first victims, West Africans for whom it was not a burdensome past but a nebulous and terrifying present. The story’s “curse” is a community’s decision to blame this incipient disaster on witchcraft, a cowardly act of scapegoating that leaves them defenseless against the very real apocalypse at hand. “Season of the Shadow,” translated from the French by Gila Walker, takes place in an isolated Douala village where a dozen men have disappeared. Several of their mothers are relegated to a communal dwelling to commiserate, an act that leads to their ostracism once a mysterious shadow materializes overhead. Like the Trojans who imprisoned the prophet Cassandra, the elders quarantine and ignore the bereaved women, with catastrophic results. Here at the beginning of slavery’s world-blighting Rapture, “night has become more than a moment in time. It is duration, space, the color of ages to come.” Reading Miano’s brilliant, pitiless novel is like treading water in an undertow. The approaching wave — more than four centuries high and tens of millions of victims long — is invisible from within the story’s deliberately confined perspective. But the omission only enhances its force. We may know all about the Middle Passage, but Miano’s characters know only that their boys are missing; that the neighboring towns’ hunters have built an unusual number of forest retreats; that somewhere at the world’s edge, the Coastlanders do a brisk business with the “men with hen feet.” (Beyond this enigmatic phrase, Europeans have almost no presence in the novel. The fleets of scavenging Guineamen anchor just beyond the frame, like U.F.O.s.) The elimination of hindsight is narratively thrilling and Miano’s decision to adopt a Douala perspective and chronology — rather than the diaspora’s elegiac retrospect — profoundly original. Image CreditMelinda Beck These are nobody’s “ancestors.” Miano’s protagonists are not the abducted but those who investigate their disappearance: the midwife, the chief’s scheming brother, a desperate mother who tracks her kidnapped son through the bush. None manage to save the village from its ruinous complacency but several find sanctuary in a hidden lake village beyond the slavers’ nets. (Slaving gave rise to many such settlements; Ganvié, perched over a lagoon in Benin, has been called the “Venice of Africa.”) Their desperate ingenuity serves as a powerful lesson: It is often the most vulnerable, those thought “cursed” because of circumstance, who first apprehend threats endangering everyone. Decades before the 1994 genocide in which her parents and 35 of her other relatives were killed, Scholastique Mukasonga endured its grim precursor amid Rwanda’s independence. Her memoir BAREFOOT WOMAN (Archipelago Books, paper, $16), translated from the French by Jordan Stump, is a tribute to her mother, Stefania, and the refugee women of Bugesera, a Land of Nod where the Hutu government relocated thousands of Rwandan Tutsis in the 1960s. Royal tradition and colonial race science once afforded the Tutsi minority a superior place in Rwanda’s social hierarchy, but Mukasonga grew up in the aftermath of this illusory privilege. Premised on a European obsession with the Tutsis as a eugenically or even biblically chosen race of “Hamites,” it ultimately proved a curse. Conceived as a “shroud” of sentences for her mother, “Barefoot Woman” is also a paean to the traditions of Rwandan womanhood Stefania preserved in exile. Bugesera’s deportees lived in a world of scarce bread, travel restrictions, constant surveillance and the daily threat of assault by Hutu soldiers, some of whom considered the rape of young Tutsi women a “revolutionary act.” Stefania’s house was a bulwark against this unrelenting terror; its back courtyard, a gathering place for local women, is “Barefoot Woman”’s inner sanctum. Enthroned on a termite mound in the courtyard, under the “parasol” of a tall coffee tree, Stefania presides over family matters and, on Sundays, a “genuine Parliament” of pipe-smoking wives, whose duties include matchmaking sessions where marriageable young women audition for Stefania’s endorsement. Around the hearth, old Rwandan folk tales dispel the gloom of exile. Yet loss is lodged in every reminiscence. Grief recalls Mukasonga to the hard present; emerging from the memory of her mother’s friends, she finds herself loitering by the window of a pipe shop in France. She stays outside — what savor could tobacco have without another woman to share it? Mukasonga is a master of subtle shifts in register — a skill inherited, perhaps, from the Rwandan traditions of intricate courtesy and assiduous privacy that Stefania maintained. She turns everything over restlessly: In her prose, poignant reminiscences sharpen into bitter ironies, or laments reveal flashes of comedy, determination, defiance. Interrupting the memory of her mother’s folk tales, Mukasonga reflects on the “other stories” invented by white people, “experts” who “concocted a tailor-made race just for us.” More painful still is the recollection that Stefania took pride in these ersatz origin stories, including a theory that Tutsis were not true Rwandans but had migrated from what she called “Businiya” (a corruption of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia). It was a story the génocidaires of 1994, endeavoring to reclaim their country for “real” Rwandans, took to heart — “Businiya, Abyssinia, Ethiopia: How could my mother have foreseen that those words would bring death to so many of us?” What solace is possible when a sustaining identity is also the germ of a tragedy — when who you are becomes a curse? It is a theme that Mukasonga perpetually revisits, often discovering the balm for traditional stigmas within tradition itself. One of “Barefoot Woman”’s most wrenching passages is also its most resolute. When soldiers rape and impregnate a young woman fetching water, convention dictates that she and her child are cursed. But “solidarity and pity” prove “stronger than tradition” as Stefania finds a way to circumvent the anathema. After the baby is born, she and several other women wash mother and child in the waters of a sacred spring, where legend holds that Rwanda’s founding monarch once thrust his spear into the ground. The improvised ritual is a retelling that also grasps at a redeemed future, and its impulse echoes in the novels of Miano, Moore and Makumbi. These books insist that if curses have any virtue, it may be in returning us to the beginning — that Archimedean point from which every story can be remade, where the difference between “malediction” and “benediction” can be as slight as a switched prefix.

arts Pittsburgh Report: Five Places for Healing Through Art - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|Pittsburgh Report: Five Places for Healing Through Art Supported by Critic’s Notebook Pittsburgh Report: Five Places for Healing Through Art A vibrant visual arts community offers museums and alternative spaces in which to commune and ponder how to move forward. Image Alex Da Corte’s “Rubber Pencil Devil,” from 2018, at the Carnegie International's 57th edition.CreditCreditAlex Da Corte and Karma New York; Tom Little By Martha Schwendener Jan. 2, 2019 For the art world, the biggest news coming out of Pittsburgh last year should have been the opening of the 57th edition of the Carnegie International, the oldest survey exhibition of visual art in the United States. Instead, news of that exhibition was eclipsed in October by a shooting at the progressive Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, which killed 11 people and wounded six. Art seems minor in the wake of such events. And yet, as time and history stretch out in the aftermath of trauma, art becomes a prime place where tragedy is acknowledged, memorialized and processed. Art is an inherently hopeful gesture, and as institutions increasingly become forums (“laboratories,” in the current parlance) for new ideas — not just places to show off wealth or wield “soft power” — they can be places to heal and ponder how to move forward. In Pittsburgh — where vast sums of money made relatively quickly during the Industrial Revolution were spent on art — museums and alternative spaces abound, complementing many schools and universities. Contemporary art, with its global ambitions, feels right at home. The city was, historically, a magnet for immigrants and home to indigenous peoples. A recent tour of Pittsburgh showed how the vibrant visual arts community, in many ways, offers a model for diversity and tolerance. Image El Anatsui’s “Three Angles,” draped on the Carnegie Museum of Art for the Carnegie International.CreditEl Anatsui and Jack Shainman Gallery; Bryan Conley Carnegie International, 57th Edition, 2018 Through March 25 at Carnegie Museum of Art; 412-622-3131, cmoa.org. This edition of the Carnegie International, organized by Ingrid Schaffner, includes 32 artists and artist collectives — and very few unfamiliar names. The upside of this approach is that many of the artists here are midcareer and know, from experience, how to operate within the potentially homogenizing context of a large exhibition and create exceptional displays. Several here are outstanding, activating the Carnegie Museum of Art’s collection and making you think differently about art history. On the outside of the museum, El Anatsui, the Ghanaian sculptor who has become one of the most imitated artists in Africa, has draped the upper facade of the entrance with a work made from his signature found bottle caps and printing plates sourced from a Pittsburgh printing press. The work treats the museum like a kind of body to be dressed with a garment. Inside the galleries, Ulrike Müller and Sarah Crowner use bright tiles, enamel, weaving and canvases sewn together to test the line between art and craft. Nearby, a terrific presentation of portraits by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye with cryptic titles suggests painting as a portal into the everyday lives of her characters, while Dayanita Singh’s installation with lush silver gelatin images bundled in cloth in India questions how history in the form of images is archived and stored. The boundary between furniture and sculpture is playfully transgressed in Jessi Reaves’s fantastic full-room installation, where art and design blend. You’re encouraged to sit on the sculpture-furniture. If you make the pilgrimage out to Fallingwater, Frank Lloyd Wright’s “cabin” masterpiece designed for the family of Edgar J. Kaufmann, you can see Ms. Reaves’s sculpture on the terrace, made during a residency there: a lanky homemade shelving unit with an iridescent burgundy zip-on mantle that looks like a sadomasochistic vampire’s cape. Back in the museum, Josiah McElheny, working with the curators John Corbett and Jim Dempsey, shows his MacArthur-award mettle with an expertly researched display. Curious musical instruments and documents relate to maverick composers like Harry Partch, Pauline Oliveros and Lucia Dlugoszewski, who created sculptural wooden instruments that are one of the standouts of the installation. Two artists who engage with the Carnegie’s collection in innovative ways are Karen Kilimnik and Jeremy Deller. Mr. Deller has installed tiny video screens in window-size cases in the museum, turning historical displays of upscale living rooms into updated everypersons’ dollhouses. Ms. Kilimnik is exhibiting her effusively florid paintings alongside the Carnegie’s decorative arts collection, as if to show how the salon-style hang, created to bring art (and intellectual discourse) to mass audiences in the French salons of the 18th and 19th centuries, could also be a form of aspirational kitsch. Image An installation view of Koyo Kouoh’s “Dig Where You Stand,” from the Carnegie International.CreditBryan Conley One of the most ambitious presentations here is the terrific show-within-a-show, “Dig Where You Stand,” organized by the Cameroon-born Koyo Kouoh, with research contributed by graduate students at the University of Pittsburgh. Drawing from the collections of the Carnegie Museums for what she calls a “visual essay,” she points out that changing language is the taproot of changing ideas. She wants us to rethink “coloniality” — different forms of colonialism and occupation — since Africa, she points out in the guide, is a continent with 54 very different countries; the one thing they all share is that they were colonized. Throughout the ocher-colored space she has paired objects and images to make you question their origins and messages. African sculptures sit near Mickalene Thomas’s photograph of black women assuming the pose from a famous Manet painting. Screenprints by Kara Walker are juxtaposed with a cutout silhouette of an “honorable” gentleman holding a whip. Ms. Kouoh throws all categories into a quandary. Bernd and Hilla Becher’s black-and-white photographs of outdated industrial structures in Germany — considered landmarks of conceptual art — are shown next to Teenie Harris’s photographs of a 1950s home-appliance fair for African-Americans in Pittsburgh. What defines art history and constitutes a survey museum? What’s included, championed and omitted — and how do those decisions reflect colonial and racist history? The implication is that every encyclopedic museum is probably sitting on a trove of exceptional objects that could be artfully rearranged to promote diversity, inclusion and tolerance, rather than acquisition and power. (Unless, of course, all the art should be “repatriated” and sent back to where it was made, though “home” may no longer exist.) Image A view of Karina Smigla-Bobinski’s installation, “ADA,” at the Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh.CreditTom Little Artists in Residence Through Aug. 4 at the Mattress Factory; 412-231-3169, mattress.org. The Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh’s premier alternative space, housed in a former industrial building and a couple of annexes, has become a mecca for installation art. Here you will find immersive works by the pioneering light artist James Turrell and one of Yayoi Kusama’s wildly popular “infinity rooms.” The focus, however, is on the temporary residents at the Mattress Factory and what they produce. The projects by 2018 residents include the Brazilian collective OSGEMEOS’s top-floor installation, with large yellow light bulbs sprouting from the floor, altered photographs and paintings that pay homage to cheap portrait studios in Latin America, and a wild zoetrope, a pre-film animation device that winds up a couple of times a day. Laleh Mehran’s darkened room in the basement relies on viewer-activated digital effects that update the ancient Persian concept of “Boroosh” or “glimmer of light.” In the nearby Monterey Annex, Karina Smigla-Bobinski’s transparent ball, studded with charcoal and inspired by nanobiotechnology and 19th-century computer prototypes, becomes a viewer-activated drawing machine you can bounce off the walls. Christina A. West’s electric apple-hued “Screen” (2018) is like a distorted fun house inspired by photographic green screens. In general, the works at the Mattress Factory are engaging crowd pleasers that challenge how we create and relate to our environments — although sometimes they sacrifice rigor for social-media “likes.” Image Zach Blas’s “Contra-Internet: Jubilee 2033,” from 2018, a video still, from “Paradox: The Body in the Age of AI,” at Miller ICA.CreditZach Blas ‘Paradox: The Body in the Age of AI’ Through Feb. 3 at Miller ICA at Carnegie Mellon University; 412-268-3618, miller-ica.cmu.edu. Located on a university campus and close to research laboratories devoted to information technology, “Paradox: The Body in the Age of AI,” a show of 11 contemporary artists organized by Elizabeth Chodos at Miller ICA, offers a perfect context for considering humans of the future. The title refers to Moravec’s paradox, the discovery that we can teach machines to reason and play chess — but not to master toddler-level sensorimotor skills encoded in the human brain through evolution. Claudia Hart’s installation with a virtual reality headset activates this principle by putting you in a new, disorienting sensorial environment. Jes Fan and Nick Cave create biomorphic sculptures that imagine new life-forms, and Zach Blas’s speculative video envisions a post-gender, post-capitalist cyberworld. Questioning the role of the artist in the age of artificial intelligence, Brian Bress includes his own work-in-progress as one of the illusionistic layers in a video laden with visual trickery, called “Sunset Geometry” (2018). Siebren Versteeg’s algorithmically generated painting machine makes attractive abstractions, suggesting that AI is slowly closing the gap between rational computing and corporeal creativity. Image “Michael” (2018) by Devan Shimoyama, from his show “Cry, Baby,” at the Andy Warhol Museum.CreditDevan Shimoyama, Richard Gerrig and Timothy Peterson ‘Devan Shimoyama: Cry, Baby’ Through March 17 at the Andy Warhol Museum; 412-237-8300, warhol.org. In the mid-1970s, Andy Warhol was commissioned by an Italian art dealer to create portraits of drag stars who treated gender — altered through clothing, wigs and makeup — as a medium. “Ladies and Gentlemen” (1974-75) is paradoxically one of Warhol’s largest and yet least-known series. A collaged painting made with glitter, rhinestones and jewelry by Devan Shimoyama, an art professor at Carnegie Mellon University, hangs alongside the “Ladies and Gentlemen” paintings, creating a near-perfect pairing. On another floor in the Warhol Museum, Mr. Shimoyama presents dozens of paintings, sculptures and photographs in which he uses himself as a boundary-testing and stereotype-breaking model, often in the imagined context of the African-American barbershop, a hotbed of heteronormative masculinity. A series of photographs created by Mr. Shimoyama during a residency on Fire Island in New York, in 2015, documents private rituals he performed on the beach with driftwood. He made the photographs at a moment when violence against black Americans was, once again, headline news, and began by reading about witchcraft, queer counterculture and chaos magic, photographing his body like a shaman, in the same way Warhol’s subjects performed in various genders to rise above a bleak real world.

The Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave uses paper to remake historical costumes and dresses in famous museum paintings. Inspired by a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in the mid-1990s, Ms. de Borchgrave’s crumpled, pleated and painted marvels sit perfectly within the Frick’s collection of old masters, imitating the silk, satin, velvet and brocade the artists captured in paint. There are re-creations here of costumes worn by queens and mythical goddesses in masterpieces by Botticelli and other painters, and of fashion designs by Paul Poiret and Jeanne Lanvin. Some of her most stunning works here, however, hang on walls: They recreate Central Asia caftans from the 1700s to the 1800s, which Ms. de Borchgrave first encountered in Istanbul. They demonstrate her considerable skill as a painter and expand the Frick’s Western European-inspired collection into the customs and aesthetics of cultures far beyond the aspirations of Pittsburgh’s Gilded Age patrons.

In his new book, “The War Before the War,” Delbanco argues that disputes over the fates of fugitive slaves did much to accelerate the divisions that led to the Civil War. “The fugitive slave law was an important force in bringing the public and the personal together for more and more Americans, and thereby woke them up to the fact that this was an existential moral problem,” Delbanco says. “How could you have a democratic republic based on the principle of liberty and equality in which millions of human beings were enslaved, some of whom were courageous enough to actually escape and tell you about it? It became more difficult to keep one’s head in the sand.” Image Rob Dunn also joins us this week, to discuss his new book, “Never Home Alone,” which is about the many (many, many) microbial life-forms that live in your house, your car and your place of work.

By Scott Bradfield Dec. 7, 2018 THE LITTLE SNAKE By A.L. Kennedy 132 pp. Canongate. $20. In A.L. Kennedy’s brief, moving parable about a snake that comes to dinner and lingers for a lifetime, evil isn’t an alien creature from another country. Rather, it arrives under our feet in the garden like a forgotten bracelet, tastes us amiably with its forked tongue, sleeps softly beside us on our pillow and, when we’re lonely, sends us pleasant dreams across vast distances. Every so often, it might go off to explore new places and people, but it always returns home. And even when it’s far away, it never stops whispering our name. “The Little Snake” takes readers from an Eden-like beginning to a post-apocalyptic wasteland and back again like one of those looping time-paradox narratives in a particularly perplexing episode of “Dr. Who.” (Surprisingly — or perhaps not surprisingly at all — Kennedy has written some recent fictional spinoffs of the British science-fiction-as-parable television series.) This short novel’s protagonist is a little girl named Mary who lives in a poorly governed city filled with elegant possibilities: “interesting songs and stories, foods and clothes and conversations.” The inhabitants reside in “great towers” presided over by dancing colorful kites. Their apartments “contained beautiful pools to swim in, or to keep fish, or perhaps vast tanks containing large reptiles like crocodiles and blue iguanas. And they had larders as big as living rooms and living rooms as big as meadows and probably meadows in their basements that were as big as small counties with jeweled roller coasters and golf courses made of cake.” Image But these vast spaces start to grow smaller when Mary is visited by a little snake named Lanmo, who advises her about all the things they don’t teach in school, such as the significance of love and jungles, and the necessity of avoiding lions, bears and hippopotamuses. He protects her from nightmares — especially the ones that might arise now that she has a snake sleeping on her pillow. When she leaves her dying city, he leads her to a newer, brighter one. And, most of all, he instructs her about the nature of snakes like himself, the kind one never reads about in books, the kind that always, inevitably, shows its deadly sharp teeth to everyone it meets. A. L. Kennedy has long been a surprising and pleasurable writer. Her prose style and the way she tells stories seem unspectacular at first — a series of genuinely odd observations on the world, conducted by unhappy people — but through the strength of her emotional accuracy and an idiosyncratic, often profound sense of humor she creates absorbing entrapments. After entering Kennedy’s world, it’s hard to find a way out, except through the final pages. In her more “realistic” fiction, such as the World War II period-drama “Day” or her recent novel about surviving the daily confrontations of London, “Serious Sweet,” distraught people think long and loud about themselves while, say, releasing a trapped bird from garden netting or enduring a painful visit to the gynecologist. There seems to be no situation, however awkward or mundane, in which Kennedy can’t discover humor and humanity. In “The Little Snake,” the swift emotional slippages click along, one after another, sentence after sentence, like an intricate concatenation of rainbow-bright dominoes. Funny, surprising and unexpected, her individual sentences seem to follow inevitably from the equally surprising sentences that precede them — as when Lanmo embarks on one of his journeys through a world confusingly populated by motley humans: “And the snake passed, faster than threats or rumors, over the world. He met with many humans to do his work. He met a woman who loved the shape of bicycles leaning against walls and he met a boy who loved apples and a young woman who played the violin and who loved a young woman who played the flute and he met an old man who hated everyone he saw for reasons he told no one. And Lanmo sometimes met little girls, and they would remind him of Mary, and on those days, at the time when the snake knew it would be sunset in her country, Lanmo would send his friend especially wonderful dreams.” Eventually, Mary grows old, and the little snake comes for her (as it must come for all of us). But even when the inevitable arrives, it feels inevitably surprising, slinking toward us through a garden of possibilities that grows wider as our steps grow smaller. Kennedy’s prose — like the endlessly unreeling speculations of her most interesting characters — is simultaneously logical and illogical, sad and funny, simple and profound, turning over and over in endless permutations, like an elegant small snake wrestling against the constraints of its own shiny and menacing skin. Scott Bradfield’s most recent book is “Dazzle Resplendent: Adventures of a Misanthropic Dog.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page 11 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Life Lessons.

arts Opinion | Could Trump Refuse a Subpoena? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Opinion|Could Trump Refuse a Subpoena? Opinion Supported by Could Trump Refuse a Subpoena? By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist June 4, 2018 Image President Trump attended the U.S. Coast Guard change of command ceremony in Washington on June 1.CreditCreditGetty Images This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, could President Trump really refuse a subpoena to testify in Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, as Trump’s lawyers have asserted in a letter obtained by The Times? The legal experts Steve Vladeck and Benjamin Wittes are skeptical. In a Lawfare piece on the subject last month, they wrote: “The bottom line, in our view, is that Mueller would probably prevail if and when a battle over a grand-jury subpoena makes its way into court. But it is not a sure thing, and the president has plausible arguments available to him that a court would have to work through before enforcing a subpoena for his testimony.” That same letter from Trump’s lawyers offers yet another admission that the president and his aides have been brashly lying for months — this time about whether Trump dictated a statement from his son Donald Trump Jr. regarding a meeting with Russians. Caroline Orr helpfully points to a CNN video with some of the earlier lies. In The Times, Harry Litman — a former deputy assistant attorney general — explains the central claim of the letter from Trump’s lawyers: that he is above the law. Good political news, really. My column today is about two big pieces of good news that have been partly buried by all things Trump: The United States is slowly moving toward universal prekindergarten and toward universal health insurance. The first piece of good news came from the city of Chicago, which announced it would start universal full-time pre-K. That means its public-school system will now start at age four. Chicago’s move is part of a nationwide trend. About 44 percent of four-year-olds nationwide are enrolled in a public pre-K program, a big increase over the past 15 years. And Virginia expanded its Medicaid program last week, making it the 33rd state to do so. No state that has expanded Medicaid — as part of Obamacare — has later undone the expansion. I argue in the column that Chicago and Virginia together offer a road map for using government as a force for good in the Trump era. For more on pre-K, I recommend this report by the National Institute for Early Education Research, which describes the recent growth and the remaining challenges. In my column, I mentioned research by the economist Elizabeth Cascio on the benefits of universal pre-K. Some other economists prefer targeted government programs that serve only lower-income students. To hear that case, read this op-ed by the economist Art Rolnick. Similarly, The Chicago Tribune worried in an editorial last week that the city’s new program would be too expensive. My view is that universal pre-K brings bigger benefits than targeted programs do, as Cascio’s research shows, and that the long-term returns are hugely positive. I’d be in favor of government cuts to many other programs before cutting — or failing to create — pre-K for budgetary reasons. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

arts Decoding Robert Rauschenberg - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|Decoding Robert Rauschenberg Supported by Decoding Robert Rauschenberg His quarter-mile-long mural is a self-portrait of a man who reshaped 20th-century art. Now, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, curators decipher the work’s meaning. By Roslyn Sulcas Dec. 24, 2018 Video Robert Rauschenberg Foundation; Photographs by Rozette Rago for The New York Times LOS ANGELES — Between 1981 and 1998, Robert Rauschenberg created a self-portrait a quarter of a mile long. Over 17 years, this Texas-born artist — by then established as a major figure who had reshaped 20th-century art — painted, drew, silk-screened, photographed, glued and combined objects on 190 panels, adding free-standing objects, including ambient sound from recordings he made over time. Lined up, the panels measure the distance between Rauschenberg’s home and his studio on Captiva Island in Florida, where he spent his last decades living and working, when he wasn’t traveling with ambitious artistic projects. Rauschenberg saw art as a catalyst for powerful social change, and the panels reflect his travel to countries with repressive regimes in the 1970s and early 1980s, where he spoke out for artistic freedom of expression. “The 1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece” is being shown in its entirety for the first time at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where it tells the fragmented, layered story of the artist’s life and his changing creative preoccupations. It also encompasses the many phases of his career: the early Combines, those found-object hybrids in the 1950s and 1960s; the assemblages of boxes that he called Cardboards in the 1970s; the scrap-metal Gluts of the 1980s. Here too are the brightly patterned shirts and cloths and the motifs — animals, umbrellas, street signs, images of athletes and sporting equipment — that pervade his work, as well as his ongoing experimentation with techniques and materials. “The thing that is marvelous is that it’s personal, like a memoir, but also mapped upon the whole world,” said Michael Govan, Lacma’s chief executive and director, who is also the exhibition’s co-curator, with Katia Zavistovski. “You see the emergence of globalism through the work, his interest in media, in transportation and space travel. From today’s perspective, it’s like the internet, with information flying off it. It all seems to point to the world getting smaller and access to images greater.” Image Robert Rauschenberg's "The 1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece," currently on view at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, includes street signs among its freestanding sculptures.CreditRobert Rauschenberg Foundation; Rozette Rago for The New York Times Mr. Govan said he had known about the work “probably since the 1980s when Rauschenberg was making it” and had long wanted to present it. Although Rauschenberg showed portions of the work, and several museums, including the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art and the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, have mounted near-complete versions, this is the first time all 190 panels are on view, as part of the exhibition “Rauschenberg: The ¼ Mile” at Lacma. (In Beijing, censors withdrew two panels after objecting to an image of Mao and what they interpreted as a swastika.) Rauschenberg, who died in 2008 at 82, began making art in the late 1940s, while studying with Josef Albers at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. There, he met the composer John Cage and the choreographer Merce Cunningham, with whom he would have long collaborative friendships. Their influence pushed Rauschenberg beyond the traditional idea of working in a single medium. From the start, he was an iconoclast, committed to using everyday materials and found artifacts, blurring the lines between sculpture and painting, between reproduction and individual creation, between objects and artworks. All of these impulses, interests and expressions can be found in the mural, which Ms. Zavistovski described as “ extraordinarily expansive and extraordinarily detailed.” In a wide-ranging discussion, Mr. Govan and she picked the panels they were particularly drawn to and described their relevance to Rauschenberg’s work and life. These are edited versions of their comments. Katia Zavistovski Panels 44-60, 67, 68 and 74, known as ‘Bob’s Army’ Image Panels 45-59 and 61 in the foreground.CreditRobert Rauschenberg Foundation; Photographs by Rozette Rago for The New York Times This section was completed in 1983, and was inspired by the terra-cotta warriors that had been excavated in the 1970s from the mausoleum of the first emperor of China. But what Rauschenberg shows in these panels are the outlined figures of his friends, family members, lovers, studio employees — all the people who filled his world. He includes images as clues to identify each person. The photographer Emil Fray has a camera; panels showing his friends David Case and David Bradshaw included printed reproductions of Michelangelo's “David.” The panels are extremely rich in content, but also in their use of materials. What appears as paint is actually saffron-dyed cloth from Southeast Asia, and there is an incredible layering of fabric, paint and solvent-transferred print images from all sorts of mass media sources, as well as actual objects, like a ruler and an umbrella.

The outline of his body, traced on fabric, references his early blueprint works from 1949 to ’51, a series of bodily impressions impressed on exposed blueprint paper. These are essentially cyanotypes, or photograms, but Rauschenberg referred to them as “blueprints.” There are also images that help to identify him: his Siberian husky; mangos and avocados, which grew on Captiva Island; birds; cars; and references to astronomy. He also included reproductions of the Great Sphinx of Giza and of a painting by Rubens, linking himself to art history. Panels 105-109 Image Panels 105-109.CreditRobert Rauschenberg Foundation; Photographs by Rozette Rago for The New York Times These panels relate to a project Rauschenberg founded called the Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange, known as ROCI. [Announced at the United Nations, it was pronounced Rocky, which was the name of his pet turtle.] From 1984 to ’91, he traveled to 10 countries that either had authoritarian regimes or restricted freedom of expression. He would engage in dialogue with communities and artists and stage exhibitions. He was working on ROCI concurrently with “1/4 Mile,” and incorporated a lot of what he saw and experienced as an activist into this work. The use of copper as the surface material is directly related to his time in Chile, where he visited a number of copper mines. He liked copper for its formal qualities — its reflectivity and ability to tarnish — but also saw using it as a form of solidarity with miners and against Augusto Pinochet [the country’s dictator].

There is a wide range of images: a pediment, a rooster, a watermelon, a house and palm tree, the image of Christ on the cross overlaid with a telephone pole. It’s difficult to create a distinct narrative, but I think it’s both a travelogue and social commentary, perhaps about infrastructure. I love this section because formally and visually it is beautiful, but also because the panels speak to a conviction about the importance of dialogue and exchange. Michael Govan Panel 24 Image Panels 18-24.CreditRobert Rauschenberg Foundation; Photographs by Rozette Rago for The New York Times This triangular plexiglass box, protruding off the wall, was made in 1981. It contains a world map and a junk rattan chair, and it reminds me of the capsule of a rocket, which you see many times in Rauschenberg’s work. In fact, there are many images of flying in general: planes, birds, arcs of motion. The chair here feels like a stand-in for the artist, flying around the earth in this broken rattan seat. The box seems to literally and metaphorically point the way, like an arrow. He was soon going to be traveling the world with the ROCI project, and it seems to declare that intention. It also makes me think of the internet now, and the way we are often armchair travelers with it.

The idea that he would use a thrown-away cardboard box or a broken chair is so beautiful, because it shows art for what it is: the transformation of nothing into something. Panels 179-183 Image Panels 179 -183, completed in Summer 1997, featuring silkscreened ink on Lexan with aluminum mounted on mirror.CreditRobert Rauschenberg Foundation; Rozette Rago for The New York Times This is a fantastic construction completed in the summer of 1997, and it comes near the end of the exhibition. It’s made of transparent Lexan that has been silk-screened. The way he constructed it, with the images on the clear Lexan, the zigzag angles of the panels and a mirror at the back, makes it a combination of sculpture and painting. The images are being rearranged all the time in an incredibly active, kinetic way, depending on where you are looking. For Rauschenberg, things are always variable and changing. There is always a place for chance in the John Cagean sense. Image Details of Panels 179-181, featuring silkscreened ink on Lexan with aluminum mounted on mirror.CreditRobert Rauschenberg Foundation; Rozette Rago for The New York Times I think in the art world, there has always been a certain lack of interest in Rauschenberg’s later work, from the 1980s and ’90s. The big Rauschenberg retrospectives at the Guggenheim and the Tate have certainly privileged the early work. But I always felt he came into his own in the ’80s; he had command of his mediums, the space in which to create huge projects and was traveling extensively. I think this project shows the way he made the personal reach to the edges of the world. Rauschenberg: The 1/4 Mile Through June 9 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; lacma.org. Correction:  An earlier version of this article omitted some of the panel numbers in a section about "Bob's Army." They are panels 44-60, 67, 68 and 74, not just panels 44-60. The article also misspelled the name of a photographer. He is Emil Fray, not Emile Frey. In panels showing his friends David Case and David Bradshaw, Rauschenberg included printed reproductions of Michelangelo's "David"; he did not paint Michelangelo’s "David." And a picture caption with the article misstated the panels shown. They are panels 23-24, not panels 21-24. Additionally, the article, using information provided by a source, also misstated the source of a detail from panel 106. It is from the interior of the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santiago, not the exterior. Using information provided, the article misstated the material used in panels 179-183.

Image Tommy Caldwell at his home.CreditCreditDaniel Brenner for The New York Times By Steven Kurutz Dec. 28, 2018 Age: 40 Occupation: professional rock climber; star of the documentary “The Dawn Wall”; author of “The Push.” Location: Estes Park, Colo. His favorite room: His garage, which he converted into a climbing gym and office. The big open room with a lofted work space is a big step up from Mr. Caldwell’s first practice wall at his childhood house, where he and his father glued rocks and fashioned a rudimentary arch from plywood. “This one,” he said, “is pretty awesome.” There’s a Weezer song where the lyrics go, “In the garage, I feel safe.” How do you feel in your garage? It’s totally like my Zen place. I put on music. I train. I get to recenter myself in there. My office is in there, too, so it’s my creative space. For the past decade, I’ve primarily been on climbing trips. But I’d just had my first kid, and was about to have a second one. I was also writing my book. I was going into the first period of my life where I was going to be home a lot. I wanted to hold on to my climbing fitness, so I built this home gym.

Usually, I chop wood to warm up. Then I go in there, climb around on the wall. I try to block out three hours, minimum. One of the nice things about indoor training is you can make holds that are better on your skin, so you can train more before your fingers wear out. You can get stronger faster climbing inside. There’s so much gear and clothing in here. Like this big bin of shoes. I have different shoes for different types of climbing, six or seven different shoes that I alternate. Some I can wear through in a few weeks. Then I have running shoes over by the door, ski boots. There’s an absurd amount of footwear in there.

That was just probably my kids goofing around with tape. The checkerboard wall is just for the kids. We’ll all go in there and train together and have fun. Sometimes we’ll put gummy bears on the holds, or cars, and they climb up to get them. It’s like a bounce house for the kids. Climbing in here, are you at a remove from the danger of your profession? As I get more experienced, I love the idea of going into big mountains and doing big climbs. But the problem is, it’s getting more dangerous, especially alpine climbing.

arts ‘The Jungle’ Review: Migrants’ Heartbreaking Search for Home in Calais - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Theater Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Theater|‘The Jungle’ Review: Migrants’ Heartbreaking Search for Home in Calais Supported by Critic’s Pick ‘The Jungle’ Review: Migrants’ Heartbreaking Search for Home in Calais Image Mohammad Amiri, left, and Ammar Haj Ahmad in the “The Jungle” at St. Ann’s Warehouse.CreditCreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times By Ben Brantley Dec. 9, 2018 The tumult that arises from many people of many nations trying to build a city together has subsided for the moment. It is the beginning of the second act of the thrilling drama “The Jungle,” which opened on Sunday at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, and it feels as if all the world is holding its breath. Everyone on and off the stage — and the boundaries between the two are unnervingly porous in this immersive London-born production — is focused on the 17-year-old Sudanese boy, newly bruised and bleeding, with the ugly lattice of scars on his bared torso. His name is Okot, and he is about to enumerate the times he died — and no, he doesn’t say “almost died” — during his journey, thousands of miles across desert and ocean, to this migrant camp in Calais, France. Portrayed by John Pfumojena with a concentrated stillness that absorbs light and sound, Okot asks an older member of the camp, a Syrian, if there is any point in his saying what he is about to say: “If I talk to her, you think she will understand?” Video Two scenes in 360 video from the immersive play “The Jungle,” about the Calais refugee camp in France. It opened in New York at St. Ann’s Warehouse.Published OnDec. 9, 2018CreditCreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times He’s referring specifically to Beth (Rachel Redford), an earnest young English volunteer in the camp. But the question encompasses us, the audience, too. Okot’s Syrian friend, Safi (the wonderful Ammar Haj Ahmad), answers, “She doesn’t know. They don’t know.” At the end of Okot’s narrative, an account that makes “tragedy” (Beth’s word) seem inadequate and frivolous, he is asked, “How did you survive?” Another member of the encampment, an Eritrean woman (Nahel Tzegai), answers for all of them, “We didn’t.” Up to that point, “The Jungle” has been a vigorously engrossing production, depicting the creation of the self-contained village of the title, a refuge for more than 6,000 migrants in 2015 and 2016. The play’s writers, the young Englishmen Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, set up an interactive arts center in that encampment, called the Good Chance Theater. “The Jungle” is based on what they observed and experienced there. As directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin, with a set by Miriam Buether (lighted by Jon Clark), the production places the audience at the teeming center of a colony of displaced people and provisional stores, houses and churches. Benches border a network of runways, making theatergoers feel like part of the clientele of the improvised Afghan restaurant, set up by Salar (Ben Turner), which serves as a meeting place for these citizens of many — and no — nations. The play begins in a moment of crisis, when the migrants are facing eviction by the French government, and then moves back in time to the camp’s early days, when its highly diverse members were trying to establish a system for living together. Though most of the 18 cast members have one very individualized part to play, they seem to be a countless legion. Their characters come from many countries — Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq and Iran, for starters. And the show summons, with uncanny clarity, the vigorous chaos from which a provisional order gradually emerges, as it asks, “When does a place become a home?” What we see does indeed seem to take the form, miraculously, of an autonomous nation in miniature, with a view across the channel of the British shore, the land they long to escape to. There is tension, of course, and apprehension and suspicion — particularly of the various well-intentioned, clumsy English people who arrive to help build houses and organize sanitation. But the clashes are often comic, and the pure energy of actors creating a world of people creating a world of their own is exhilarating. But don’t be lulled into basking in your admiration and empathy for this diverse tribe of nomads. As exciting and entertaining as their exertions may be, the scarring pasts these characters carry and the profoundly uncertain futures they face are beyond the comprehension of those of us with homes, or even countries, to call our own. That’s what registers so harrowingly when the second act begins, with its description of Okot’s journey of many deaths. No, we don’t know what the people in the camp went through to arrive there; no, we can’t. Image John Pfumojena as Okot in “The Jungle.”CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times Nor can the English creators of this show. And perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment of “The Jungle” is that it acknowledges this incomprehension without being paralyzed by it. A crowd- and critic-pleasing hit in London, where it was first staged at the Young Vic Theater before transferring to the West End, “The Jungle” arrives here with bruising relevance to Americans for whom immigration has become part of a fraught crisis of conscience. “The Jungle” inevitably summons thoughts of the caravan of Hondurans in Tijuana and of President Trump’s travel ban. (It is worth noting that three of the cast members nearly didn’t make it to New York because they are from the largely Muslim countries whose citizens are currently denied entry into the United States.) Yet “The Jungle” is not one of those consciousness-raising exercises routinely described as “worthy.” It is, above all, a work of absorbing theater, which uses the immediacy of that art to conjure the paradoxes and confusions of a world dealing with an unprecedented flux of uprooted lives. The sensory flow of those lives is captured in both the artfully arranged rush of bodies in constant motion and an exquisitely textured aural soundscape that embraces both the taunting roar of nearby highway traffic and the susurrus of disparate voices melded in song and prayer. (Paul Arditti is the sound designer.) There are no unconditional heroes among the characters so vividly embodied here. That includes our professorial narrator, Safi, whom Mr. Ahmad presents, beautifully, as a man ultimately stranded between altruism and self-preservation. Each performance is slightly larger than life, perhaps for clarity’s sake. And actors like Mr. Turner, as the charismatic restaurateur; Mohammad Amiri, as his industrious adolescent protegee; and Trevor Fox, as a hard-drinking, guitar-strumming Briton, have a touch of the music-hall charmer. But each is also defined by human fears and frailties. It’s the do-gooding, often hapless English who become surrogates for much of the audience, and they are given winningly ardent and angry life by, among others, Jo McInnes and, as a precocious city planner fresh out of Eton, Alex Lawther (the teen psychopath from the Netflix series “The End of the ___ing World”). The English volunteers are all, as Mr. Fox’s character points out, themselves refugees of a sort, fleeing from their own lives. But the comparison with the real migrants only goes so far. These English, after all, like most of the audience, have real homes waiting for them. By the end of this extraordinary work, it is achingly clear that for the migrants, even those lucky enough to cross the English Channel, home will never again be more than a memory, and an infinitely fragile illusion.

arts A Breezy Look at Eve Babitz, a Writer With a Born Feel for the Charms of Los Angeles - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|A Breezy Look at Eve Babitz, a Writer With a Born Feel for the Charms of Los Angeles Supported by Books of The Times A Breezy Look at Eve Babitz, a Writer With a Born Feel for the Charms of Los Angeles By Dwight Garner Dec. 31, 2018 Image CreditCreditSonny Figueroa/The New York Times In her memoir “Slow Days, Fast Company” (1977), Eve Babitz described the joys of “4/60 air conditioning,” which is what you get when you’re on the freeway with all four windows down and you’re traveling at 60 miles per hour. The best of Babitz’s writing keeps the windows cranked down, too, and she is always moving at speed. The recent rediscovery and reissue of her books — her memoirs are especially resonant — has been a deep pleasure to witness. Lili Anolik helped jump-start the Babitz revival five years ago when she published a warm retrospective of the author’s life in Vanity Fair. Anolik is back now with “Hollywood’s Eve: Eve Babitz and the Secret History of L.A.,” an expansion of that profile. Don’t arrive here in search of a proper biography. Anolik warns us up front that she “won’t attempt to impose narrative structure and logic” on Babitz’s life. Further, she “doesn’t believe, or expect you to, that facts, dates, timelines, firsthand accounts, verifiable sources tell the tale.” This is awkward. When did “logic” and “facts” and “firsthand accounts” get such a bad rap? (Did I miss a memo?) Anolik makes a show of tossing her car’s steering wheel out the window at the first turn. The resulting book is good and bad in almost equal measure. It’s good because Anolik has an instinctive grasp of why Babitz mattered as a writer and because, despite her apparent protestations to the contrary, she’s done her homework. “Hollywood’s Eve” fills in many of the gaps in our knowledge of Babitz’s life and work. It’s bad because it’s so breezily written, as if willing itself to become a work of what used to be called the New Journalism, that “4/60” does not begin to cover it. Reading it, you feel you’re taking part in three conversations, two on call-waiting. Anolik’s book is filled with interjections such as “I’ve got to break in here, say something” and “Hang on a second” and “Wait, I want to withdraw that statement” and “Now, look sharp because things are about to take a turn for the funky.” Her insights deserve better than this flip tone. What “Hollywood’s Eve” has going for it on every page is its subject’s utter refusal to be dull. “I think I’m going to be an adventuress,” Babitz reports saying as a child to her mother, in “Eve’s Hollywood” (1974), her first memoir. “Is it all right?” It was, and it is. Image Lili AnolikCreditMichael Benabib Babitz grew up under the Hollywood sign. Her father was first violinist for the 20th Century-Fox orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and her mother was an artist. Her godfather was Igor Stravinsky. “He’s been slipping you glasses of Scotch under the table since you turned 13,” Anolik writes, “and his wife, the peerlessly elegant Vera, taught you how to eat caviar.” When she was barely out of her teens, Babitz posed for a now-famous photograph of herself playing chess with Marcel Duchamp. He was clothed; she was naked. Babitz was beautiful and wild and opinionated. She was a star of Los Angeles’s bohemian art and music crowds. “Eve was our Kiki of Montparnasse,” the artist Ed Ruscha said. She designed album covers for Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds. She seduced Jim Morrison and many others. Among them was the writer Dan Wakefield, who commented: “Men didn’t conquer Eve Babitz, she conquered them.” Babitz was 28 and approaching burnout (she termed it “squalid overboogie”) when she began to write in earnest. With the help of Joan Didion, a friend, she sold an essay to Rolling Stone in 1971. Babitz being Babitz, she slept with Grover Lewis, her Rolling Stone editor, and later with the editor of her first book. Didion’s intervention is interesting because it’s among this book’s contentions that Babitz’s literary career was a reaction to that of her famous friend. Where Didion took a fundamentally dark view of Los Angeles, Babitz had a feel for her hometown’s charms and celebrated them. Anolik’s writing about Didion and Babitz is graceful until it isn’t. At one point she writes, referring to an earlier conversation with Babitz: “Now, I suppose, is the time to come clean. Eve was right. I do have homicidal designs on Didion. I think ‘Play It’” — Didion’s novel “Play It as It Lays” — “is a silly, shallow book. I think ‘Slow Days’ should replace it, become the new essential reading for young women (and young men) seeking to understand L.A. There. I said it.” Babitz had affairs with Warren Zevon and Annie Leibovitz and Steve Martin. (She advised Martin to wear white suits.) She once wrote a letter to Joseph Heller, the author of “Catch-22,” that contained two sentences: “I am a stacked 18-year-old blonde on Sunset Boulevard. I am also a writer.” She spent the entirety of her first book advance on a big meal at her favorite restaurant, Musso & Frank Grill, ordering the caramel custard for everyone in the house. Her books — there were memoirs, and then novels — never sold very well. She did too much cocaine. She wrote a screenplay for the Eagles, and when they delayed paying her she threatened to kill herself. (They paid.) She got into Alcoholics Anonymous in the early ’80s. Babitz suffered third-degree burns over much of her body in a freak accident in 1997, when she tried to light a cigar in her car, a VW Bug that Steve Martin had bought her, and her skirt and pantyhose caught fire. She essentially disappeared from public life. She is now 75. Anolik tracked her down in Los Angeles, where she listens to right-wing talk radio and mostly lives like a recluse. Anolik sometimes verges on condescending to Babitz (“what a sport and a champ and a trouper”). But she’s a sensitive reader of her work and owns a sly wit. About the nude photo with Duchamp, for example, Anolik writes: “She might have something on — the radio, for example, or Chanel No. 5.” In “Slow Days, Fast Company,” Babitz observed that “the best way to approach anything was to be introduced by the right person.” Anolik’s book succeeds in its primary mission: It sends you racing to read the work of Eve Babitz.

arts Apollo Theater Is Celebrated in a New Graphic Novel - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|Apollo Theater Is Celebrated in a New Graphic Novel Supported by Apollo Theater Is Celebrated in a New Graphic Novel Image The cover of the graphic novel, adapted from a history by the same author.CreditCreditAbrams ComicArts By George Gene Gustines Jan. 2, 2019 The graphic novel “Showtime at the Apollo: The Epic Tale of Harlem’s Legendary Theater” is like a sprawling Hollywood biopic. A sea of boldface names — James Brown, the Jackson Five, Dionne Warwick and countless others — make their way through the theater. The work, adapted by Ted Fox from his 1983 history of the same name, and illustrated by James Otis Smith, goes beyond the singers, dancers, comedians and other entertainers who have taken the stage of the Apollo, which celebrates its 85th anniversary this month. The book also shines a light on Harlem and black culture in America. Fox said he reworked his Apollo history into a focused narrative told in three acts, beginning years before the first performance at the theater. An early chapter highlights the Harlem Renaissance and some nightspots, like the Cotton Club, where black performers were popular, yet where black audience members were usually barred. It also notes that the Apollo name first turns up in 1922 — when it was the name of a burlesque theater. An early page of “Showtime at the Apollo” — published by Abrams ComicArts and arriving in stores on Jan. 8 — states simply, “It is an epic tale.” An illustrated prologue, “A Quest,” shows the author in March 1980, when he meets Bobby Schiffman, the son of Frank Schiffman (a founder of the Apollo). The younger Schiffman, who temporarily shuttered the theater in 1976, agrees to cooperate with Fox on the book on one condition: “Write about the way the Apollo really was, the good and bad.” Image The graphic novel includes an inside view of the theater inspired by news clippings from a 1937 New York World-Telegram article. The graphic novel juggles the sometimes harsh realities of the outside world and the magic of the performances on stage. There is drug abuse, robberies and riots — but the overall outlook remains upbeat. Like a biopic, the second act is filled with highs and lows. On Jan. 26, 1934, Hurtig and Seamon’s Burlesque is reopened as the Apollo Theater, whose inaugural show, “Jazz à la Carte,” is what the 85th anniversary this year commemorates. In 1935, there is rioting and looting in the neighborhood, following accusations that two white clerks at a local store, S.H. Kress & Co., beat a young black shopper. (About 3,000 people descended upon S.H. Kress, according to a report in The New York Times.) During the unrest, the Apollo is spared from any physical destruction, as it will be time and again. In 1943, Harlem experiences a worse riot when a police officer shoots and arrests a black soldier. A rumor of his death spreads and many white-owned businesses in Harlem are gutted, but there is an exception: “Nobody touches the Apollo,” the graphic novel reads. “A cordon of Harlemites forms spontaneously to protect the theater.” The book makes note of other riots in the ’60s and a shooting in the theater, in 1975, during a performance by Smokey Robinson. These sobering moments balance the euphoria of other events, like the live recording of a 1963 album by James Brown, which stays on the charts for 66 weeks; or a 1980 performance by George Clinton, who opts for the Harlem stage over Madison Square Garden, a scene whose panels are filled with the refrain “One nation under groove” and “It’s Saturday Night at the Apollo.” Image The bandleader Lionel Hampton, who was known for a disappearing act, of sorts. One historic moment that comes to life is a performance by the bandleader Lionel Hampton. A caption reads, “Hampton has a penchant for clearing the Apollo, even if it means leading the audience out with his own band!” On two sequential pages, Smith illustrates the band playing, the puff of smoke that allows Hampton to disappear from the stage, the rapturous audience and a march down West 125th Street to the cheers of those outside. The Apollo artwork is filled with characters whose faces are known worldwide, in a palette of black, white and multiple blues. “I find color in comics — especially modern digital coloring — to be distracting,” Smith wrote in an email. “I love the somewhat anonymous commercial illustration of the ’40s and ’50s, and the physical limitations of print techniques. I tried to use the blue mainly as a graphic element.” Image Hampton, in one of his famous marches across West 125th Street. Smith credits Pete Friedrich, an art director, for a lot of the design work, which includes smartly placed newspaper clippings that move the story along. The story notes that performing at the theater was physically demanding: During its heyday, an engagement meant a weeklong commitment of 31 shows. Benny Payne, who played piano for Cab Calloway, describes challenging logistics: playing two shows at the Apollo and two at the downtown Paramount theater on the same day, leading to frantic cab rides with back-seat outfit changes. Despite the unrelenting artistic demands of the space, it would be financial issues that brought the theater down: In late 1979, the I.R.S. closed the Apollo for payroll-tax violations. But the third act delivers the start of a happy ending: The Apollo gets taken over by new management in 1981, begins renovations in May 1983 and, one month later, is designated a New York City landmark. Financial mismanagement strikes again; The Daily News earns a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1999 for its coverage of the plight of the theater. Order is restored, followed by an outdoor renovation that is unveiled in 2005, with the theater’s marquee made to look as much as possible as the original — though this time with a multitude of lights. Image Some of the famed voices whose careers were helped by the Apollo’s Amateur Nights, which started in the 1930s. The final dialogue in the graphic novel belongs to Francis Thomas — a.k.a. Doll, or Mr. Apollo — who was a veteran of the Harlem entertainment scene. He was the theater’s manager, technician, and, ultimately, its caretaker, and he lived in an apartment in the theater. Thomas pulls back a metamorphic curtain on the Wednesday amateur nights, which began in the 1930s and continue today. “It’s Harlem’s high spot,” he says. “The Apollo will always be that.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C12 of the New York edition with the headline: Celebrating the Apollo Theater in a Graphic Novel.

Read!” My 3-year-old is captivated by surprising or funny-sounding words, and already appreciates some of my favorite books from childhood (I have, naturally, read him nearly all of William Steig, to me the undisputed master of children’s literature), as well as many newer picture books with good stories. But when both kids are on my lap, the chunkier board books, with fewer words and a smaller format, are best. I’ve learned to perform, as the added theatricality both pleases my son’s desire for wordplay and sonic delight and helps keep my daughter’s attention. These new board books find ways to break down the barriers between little listeners and the books themselves, helping parents like me put on a successful story time show. “You can read this book in the bath,” begins HUG THIS BOOK! (Phaidon, 30 pp., $9.95; ages 0 to 4), written by Barney Saltzberg and illustrated by Fred Benaglia. This one started out as a bigger picture book, but the new board book version is a clear winner, inviting touch and placing the youngest readers right in the middle of the action, in a familiar location. Later, they are told, “If you read this book being tickled, I dare you not to laugh.” Stimulated from awareness to empathic interest, my kids were enraptured, aware the book was talking about itself, directly to them. “You can kiss and hug and smell this book” elicited tiny smooching sounds from my daughter, while my son leaned in close and sniffed it. The sketchy, energetic illustrations in a limited but bright palette charmed us all. As if more proof was needed that the kids and this book were on the same wavelength, my son asked me to read it again even before we got to the last page: “Even though this book is over, it isn’t really the end. You can start at the beginning and read it to a friend.” Image From “Animal Shapes.” You know those books you carefully move to the bottom of the stack because you can’t stand to read them one more time? Well, ANIMAL SHAPES (Little Bee, 40 pp., $11.99; ages 0 to 4), written and illustrated by Christopher Silas Neal, is the opposite kind of book: so surprising and pleasing to an adult repeat reader like me that I even found myself suggesting it to the kids. With saturated colors and clean design, the book is a hilarious smooshing together of the two things in the title. (Another smooshing-together book by Neal, “Animal Colors,” was published at the same time, so a series may be in the making.) “When a soaring bird meets a triangle, they become a fly-angle,” one example reads, illustrated by a red bird from above, flying through the sky as an equilateral triangle. And while the book is educational, technically, introducing kids to shapes from a simple square to a nonagon, the lesson is beside the point. The mash-up is simply fun to see, and to say. “When jumbled giraffes meet a rectangle, they become a neck-tangle.” My kids couldn’t identify each shape, but they got the humor, repeating “neck-tangle” and laughing. Image From “A Pile of Leaves.” As a story lover by trade and inclination, I’m not much of a fan of wordless picture books. A PILE OF LEAVES (Phaidon, 24 pp., $18.95; ages 0 to 4), by Jason Fulford and Tamara Shopsin, is an exception, and not just because it actually begins with a page of words: “A pile of leaves is like a collage. Each layer adds something new and hides something underneath.” After that comes a twist: see-through pages that let you peer through a transparent window inside a colored frame. Each surprisingly sturdy plastic page shows a layer: a leaf or two, an acorn, ants and a leaf, a grasshopper and two leaves. Then, under that top layer are lost objects — a mitten, a key — the kinds of things that might be misplaced during a romp through a pile of leaves. My kids and I paged through the book once, silently. Then we started over and talked through it, discussing leaves and piles and missing objects. “It’s like digging through a toy basket for a missing piece,” my son said. Image From “My First Pull-Tab Fairy Tales.” The MY FIRST PULL-TAB FAIRY TALES (Auzou, 10 pp. each, $10.99 each; ages 0 to 6) series, illustrated by Marion Cocklico, doesn’t offer innovative twists on the original tales, but it does provide a great, simplified, engaging way to introduce young kids to some classics, including “Pinocchio,” “Little Red Riding Hood” and “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” The design is genius — pages sturdy enough to withstand thousands of pushes and pulls from tiny hands, with pull-tabs built into each page to avoid those dangling tags or folds of paper that rip or stop functioning almost immediately. The “Goldilocks” volume is cleverly designed with ways for small fingers to pull, push and slide Goldilocks through her adventurous intrusion inside the bears’ house. On my favorite page, Goldi is asleep in the bed that was just right, until you pull the tab and she awakens to the intense stares of the three bears with hands on their hips, standing in the doorway. My daughter’s favorite? The front door she could slide open to reveal a cat — again, and again, and again. Image From “House.” I was skeptical when I initially opened the box that contains HOUSE: FIRST WORD BOARD BOOKS (Chronicle, 12 pp., $18.99; ages 0 to 3), written and illustrated by Michael Slack, a set of five books nestled together. I loved the groovy 1960s look of the cover, but I worried it would be all gimmick, no charm. Yet as soon as I lifted the lid, the kids dived in, prying out the small books, each named for a different room in the house. As they opened them, they “read” them out loud, naming the objects they saw: “Sofa! Computer! Window!” in the living room book. My son selected the garage book and shouted: “Car! Recycling! VACUUM CLEANER!” (He has a passion for vacuums, so this was a true highlight.) Both kids grinned with the pleasure of reading their perfectly sized books to me, rather than the reverse, pointing to objects and identifying them. It’s the ideal kind of kid-design, smartly conceived to appeal to and engage little readers, and requiring no explanation or instructions. That night my daughter carried several of the smallest books in the set with her to bed — well, who else could they have been meant for? Caitlin Roper is the editorial director of NYTMag Labs.

Supported by By Robert Gottlieb Dec. 31, 2018 BORN TO BE POSTHUMOUS The Eccentric Life and Mysterious Genius of Edward Gorey By Mark Dery Illustrated. 503 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $35. Edward Gorey — who concocted the famous opening credits for the PBS “Mystery!” series — was himself a tantalizing mystery, one that Mark Dery, in an over-ample new biography, sets out to solve, only to acknowledge at the end that it can’t be done. Well, every human being is a mystery, and none of us can be “solved,” but Gorey certainly invites the discussion — by the life choices he made, by the nature of his accomplishments and by his provocative self-presentations. (“Part of me is genuinely eccentric,” he acknowledged, “part of me is a bit of a put-on. But I know what I’m doing.”) There are mysteries within the mystery, and for Dery the mystery that matters most is that of Gorey’s sexuality — he gnaws away at it relentlessly throughout the 400-odd pages of his narrative. Was Gorey straight? Not very likely. Was he gay? Probably, but not actively. Did he have any sexual life at all? Was he asexual? Gorey himself addressed the question in an interview he gave to Boston magazine late in life. “I am fortunate in that I am apparently reasonably undersexed or something. I’ve never said that I was gay and I’ve never said that I wasn’t.” Responding to the direct question “What are your sexual preferences?” he replied: “Well, I’m neither one thing nor the other particularly. I suppose I’m gay. But I don’t identify with it much.” Dery makes much of the fact that when the interview was reprinted after Gorey’s death, the final two sentences were suppressed, but by the time this particular reader had reached Page 410 of “Born to Be Posthumous,” he was so tired of the endless speculation that he wouldn’t have perked up if it turned out that Gorey’s interests lay in extraterrestrials. Image An illustration from “The Blue Aspic,” 1968.CreditEdward Gorey Gorey himself clearly got tired of the issue. “I realize that homosexuality is a serious problem for anyone who is,” he said, “but then, of course, heterosexuality is a serious problem for anyone who is, too. And being a man is a serious problem and being a woman is, too. Lots of things are problems.” There had certainly been no sexual intimacy between the young Ted and his greatest friend (and roommate) at Harvard, the very gay poet Frank O’Hara, or his other great poet-friend there, John Ashbery. It was another close Harvard friend, Larry Osgood, to whom Gorey confessed “that he once had a sexual experience in his late teens, I think. And he hadn’t liked it. And that was that. He wasn’t going to do that again.” According to Dery, “one of the great unsolved mysteries of Gorey’s life is what, exactly, happened at that first (and, by all accounts, last) attempt at sex, which put him off the idea forever. It’s Gorey’s Rosebud moment, the experience that made him who he was.” Here we have Dery at his most off the wall. Surely, many — most? all? — teenagers have had mortifying sexual experiences and haven’t been traumatized forever. Gorey did acknowledge that something important was missing from his life, writing to his great friend Alison Lurie when he was 28 that he “ought to be having a few direct emotional experiences, however small.” What he did have, by his own account, were “infatuations.” “I thought I was in love a couple of times,” he said when he was in his late 60s, “but I rather think it was only infatuation. It bothered me briefly, but I always got over it. I mean for a while I’d think, after some perfectly pointless involvement that was far more trouble than it was worth — I’d think, ‘Oh God, I hope I don’t get infatuated with anybody ever again.’” Image Gorey’s artwork in the opening of Masterpiece Mystery! on PBSCreditEdward Gorey A more fundamental issue than his presumed asexuality, it seems to me, was his resistance to, or immunity from, emotional intimacy. Dery puts it this way: “He had good friends, but whether he had any close friends is an open question,” and he quotes Ashbery as saying, “I feel that he was somehow unable and/or unwilling to engage in a very close friendship with anyone, above a certain good-humored, fun-loving level.” Jason Epstein, who launched Gorey’s brilliant career at Anchor Books, remarked of his tiny stuffed apartment, “There was no room for two in that apartment — or in that life.” Perhaps the closest Gorey ever came to intimacy was with Peter Neumeyer, an editor-writer with whom he collaborated on three children’s books beginning in 1968. Theirs was a true meeting of minds, as we realize from their almost feverish published correspondence, “Floating Worlds.” “You know far more about me than anyone else in the world,” Gorey wrote to Neumeyer. But surely it was the fact that the relationship was primarily epistolary that made it possible for him to express himself so openly. And it lasted only a year or so. Even with this intellectual crush, Gorey needed to withdraw from the pressures of intimacy. Nor was he remotely touchy-feely — a locution he would have abominated — apparently shrinking even from handshakes and hugs. When Dery asked Skee Morton (Gorey’s cousin, in whose house on Cape Cod he lived on and off for years), “Did you ever see him hug anyone?,” she answered, “He hugged me at my father’s funeral. I think that’s the only time.” Carol Verburg, a Cape Cod friend, said, “Physical contact … was not in Edward’s repertoire. His level of physical contact was cat level.” He certainly was more at ease with cats than with people: He had five of them — down from six — at the time of his death. “Of all his characters, his cats are the only ones who look truly happy,” Dery acutely remarks. People perplexed him. “In one way,” he said, “I’ve never related to people or understood why they behave the way they do. … I think life is the pits.” Image CreditHoughton Mifflin Harcourt Gorey liked to say that he had a “perfectly ordinary childhood.” “I was out playing Kick-the-Can along with everybody else,” he said, perhaps a touch disingenuously. But not many kids in Chicago had learned to read before they were 4, and had made their way through “Frankenstein” and “Dracula” and Dickens and a load of Victor Hugo before they were 8. Or had astronomical I.Q.s. Or drew their first picture at 1½ (“very funny little sausagey drawings, which are meant to be railway cars”). Nor did many Midwestern kids born in 1925 have a grandmother who had created a scandal when she divorced her husband, vice president of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company, to the accompaniment of headlines. (“TRIED TO DRIVE ME INSANE” and “PHONE MAN KEPT HER IN SANITARIUM UNTIL REASON FLED.”) As Gorey put it, “My grandmother would go insane and disappear for long periods of time.” No wonder asylums turn up in so many of his tales. And no surprise that one of the cousins remarked, “It was a fairly volatile family.” Volatile in other ways as well. Dery goes into far too much detail tracking the endless, clearly compulsive changes of residence the Gorey family undertook throughout his childhood, climaxed by his moving to Florida with his mother when he was 12, some time after his parents were divorced. Soon, though, he was back at school in Chicago. By the time he was 19, he had had at least 11 different addresses and had attended five different grammar schools. “Sometimes we just moved a block away into another apartment; it was all very weird.” His parents simply weren’t compatible. Dad (Edward Leo Gorey) was a crime reporter for The Chicago Evening American, Mom (Helen Garvey Gorey) was a mom. Both parents, Dery tells us, “were of Irish descent, though the Garveys — moneyed, Republican, Episcopalian — were the lace-curtain variety, several rungs up the socioeconomic ladder from the working-class, Democrat, devoutly Catholic Goreys.” By the standards of the day, Helen had married beneath herself. Soon after the divorce, Dad — who by now was publicity director of the Drake and Blackstone hotels — had married a Latina nightclub singer, Corinna Mura (born the far-from-Latina Corynne Constance Wall), whom we can see in “Casablanca,” singing “Tango delle Rose” in Rick’s Café. In time, this marriage crumbled too, and then, in 1952, 15 years after their divorce, Ed and Helen remarried. (One day that year, Skee Morton recalled, Ted said to her, “Oh, incidentally, my parents got married again today.”) He was never close to his father, didn’t speak of him and only rarely saw him. Whereas his tangled relationship with his difficult mother never untangled: “We were far closer than I really wished most of the time, and we fought a good deal right up until the time she died, at the age of 86. She was a very strong-minded lady.” Image CreditPatricia Wall/The New York Times One constant throughout Gorey’s peripatetic school years was his drawing. He was always making cartoons and designing things for yearbooks, and his great good luck was attending the Francis W. Parker School, an advanced, liberal place that encouraged individual thinking and creative work. It was there that he met his lifelong friend Connie (Consuelo) Joerns and palled around with Joan Mitchell, on her way to becoming a world-famous Abstract Expressionist artist — they liked each other while scorning each other’s art. (Gorey made it very clear that whatever he may have been, it was certainly not a painter.) In his application for a Harvard National Scholarship, after emphasizing his interest in looking at and making art, he lists his other preoccupations: music, ballet, theater and movies. And books. His application lists 69 books he had read in the current year, ranging from Homer and Plato to Joyce and P. G. Wodehouse — all these apart from the innumerable mysteries he read (and would read throughout his life), including “my favorite author in all the world,” Agatha Christie. (When she died, he reports thinking, “I can’t go on.”) This passion for detective novels may be the one cultural impulse he shared with his equally addicted parents. Accepted by Harvard, he postponed matriculating until his situation with the draft was clarified. The United States was well into the war, and he was, indeed, drafted in May 1943. Four months of basic training at Camp Roberts in central California (“God’s garbage pit”); then assignment — given his record-breaking intelligence tests — to learn Japanese; then, when that program was shut down, assignment to Dugway Proving Ground, in the Great Salt Lake Desert, to become a company clerk: typing, sorting mail, keeping the company books and, he reported, staying “sloshed on tequila.” And writing plays, which Dery convincingly labels “self-indulgent juvenilia.” The dialogue is over the top of the top: “Have you ever danced naked before a lesbian sodden with absinthe?” But here also are his lifelong Anglophilia, “love of nonsensical titles, preposterous names (Centaurea Teep, Mrs. Firedamp), even more preposterous place names (Galloping Fronds, Crumbling Outset) and absurd deaths.” And here are more resonant themes that will recur through the next 50 years: “the melancholy of lost time … the stealthy tiptoe of our approaching mortality … and of course, angst, ennui, the banal horrors of everyday life, arbitrary and unpredictable turns of events, cruelty to children (a governess kills her charge’s pet canary), the cruelty of children (a little girl bashes her big sister’s head in with a silver salver) and murder most foul.” Gorey had practically no formal art instruction — a few classes here and there — and Harvard was as much a social experience as an educational one: He majored in French, he says, to give himself an excuse to read all of French literature, having read everything he needed to in English. His favorite writers were and remained Austen, Trollope, E. F. Benson (the Lucia novels) and Arthur Waley’s adaptation of Lady Murasaki (“Genji” was a lifelong obsession). For a couple of years after graduating, he hung around Boston, mostly working in bookshops. Unlike so many literary young men and women of his moment, he didn’t rush to travel through postwar Europe. (Despite his lifelong passion for things English, he went abroad only once: to the Scottish islands for a couple of weeks, after falling in love with the Powell-Pressburger movie “I Know Where I’m Going.” There was a layover in Heathrow, the closest he ever got to seeing England itself.) He mounted a well-attended show of watercolors in Cambridge, and he helped to found and was deeply involved with the Poets’ Theatre there, which staged plays by O’Hara, Ashbery, Richard Eberhart, Archibald MacLeish, Yeats, Lorca and Beckett (the first American staging of “All That Fall”) and presented Dylan Thomas’s first American reading of “Under Milk Wood.” He contributed two plays of his own, as well as designing sets and everything else that needed designing. He was beginning to sell drawings to various publications, and in late 1952 sold his first cover art to a major magazine, Harper’s. But essentially he was treading water — and he was 27. Image CreditEdward Gorey And then a college friend, Barbara Zimmerman — married to Jason Epstein, a young publishing whiz at Doubleday — suggested to her husband that Ted would be the perfect person to create the jacket art for Anchor Books, the new line of quality paperbacks Jason was launching. Gorey dithered — “At first I said no, but then I thought, ‘I’m not really surviving very noticeably in Boston, so I’ll move to New York, much as I hate the place.’” And so at the start of 1953 he moved, “and embarked on what is laughingly called my career.” By now Gorey had more or less perfected his eccentric image: the full beard (possibly to hide a weak chin), the scarves, the rings, the sneakers, the full-length coats, which would morph into the fur coats that would identify him throughout the remainder of his 34 years in New York. With his old friend Connie Joerns serendipitously a co-worker, he stayed at Anchor for seven years, not only producing the art for 50 or so covers (all hand-lettered) but art-directing: doing layouts, pasting up mechanicals, setting type, all of which he learned on the job. Dery can be good on Gorey’s art: “His contrapuntal use of white space, solid black shapes, and fine-lined shading produces beautifully balanced compositions that make us want to linger on each scene, exploring every nook and cranny. At times, he lights his scene as if it were a movie set or a stage, spotlighting the central figure amid the surrounding shadows.” And he recognizes that the Anchor covers could be startling in their implications. No one saw this more clearly than Gorey’s friend Maurice Sendak, who recalled a cover illustration Gorey did for Melville’s novel “Redburn” featuring a prominently crotched male observer staring at three rough-tradish sailors. “The jacket,” Sendak remarked, “summed up completely the kind of confused homosexuality of that novel.” Image Gorey’s desk, Strawberry LaneCreditChristopher Seufert In due course, Epstein left Doubleday and Anchor behind, and Gorey followed, by now having achieved some visibility with the miniature picture-and-text volumes on which his fame and reputation ultimately rest. The first, in 1953, was “The Unstrung Harp,” a long (for Gorey) account of the agonies undergone by a novelist Dery describes as of “the hand-wringingly neurotic variety.” We find here already the fine line and fiendishly demanding crosshatching that would distinguish most of the hundred-odd books to follow. Then, a few years later, beginning with “The Doubtful Guest,” came a burst of superb oddities that no one knew quite what to make of but which took hold with a growing number of connoisseurs of … oddities. “The Fatal Lozenge,” “The Curious Sofa: A Pornographic Work by Ogdred Weary” (it was far from pornographic), “The Hapless Child,” the haunting “The Willowdale Handcar” (three friends disappear into the mouth of a tunnel and fail to emerge) and half a dozen books that, as it happens, I published at Simon & Schuster, including the eerie “The West Wing” (no text), “The Gilded Bat” (tragic tale of a ballerina) and what is perhaps Gorey’s most famous work, “The Gashlycrumb Tinies,” an abecedarian (alphabet to you) book that in 26 grim spreads carries us from “Amy who fell down the stairs” through “Neville who died of ennui” to “Zillah who drank too much gin.” Dery makes much of the question of whether works like these should have been published as children’s books, but there was no way that could have happened in the relatively bland days of the 1950s. Gorey did, however, illustrate a number of other writers’ books for children. My dealings with Ted were impersonal, although we had a nodding acquaintance from performances we both attended at the New York City Ballet. It was City Ballet that consumed him throughout his New York years. He had grown up on the Ballets Russes and Martha Graham, but soon after buying his first ticket for City Ballet, in 1953, he became a passionate devotee of Balanchine’s art. Famously, he attended every performance the company gave during its New York seasons — eight performances a week — skipping a few “Nutcrackers” only at the very last. To him, as to many of us, Balanchine was the greatest figure in all the arts of our time, and it was Balanchine who kept him anchored in New York. After Balanchine died, and disliking the city after 34 years of living in it as much as he had to begin with, Gorey decamped permanently to Cape Cod, where he had bought the house in which he lived until his death. Image An entry from “The Gashlycrumb Tinies,” 1963.CreditEdward Gorey Mark Dery, alas, knows practically nothing about ballet and ballet history. Everything he tells us is clearly received wisdom at best. He is equally weak in other areas. He refers frequently to Gorey’s love for silent film (which he identifies as one of a “pantheon of canonically gay tastes”), but his knowledge of silent film is as thin as his knowledge of ballet. (D.W. Griffith’s hardly obscure “Orphans of the Storm,” for instance, is not about “children in peril.” The Gish sisters are beautiful young women fending off wicked men.) Other mistakes of Dery’s are less factual and more the result of misunderstandings and a hyperbolic and dramatizing vision of cultural life. He sees things in terms of cults, cliques, inner circles, smart sets — a kind of outsider resentment. Yes, Gorey had pals who would join him in the lobby at intermission — or he would join them. Given his height and elaborate way of dressing he was more visible than other people, but there was nothing exclusionary or self-asserting about his manner. His views were firm, but his nature was modest. (Dery even ascribes “a cult following” to Gorey’s beloved movie “I Know Where I’m Going.” No. It came out in 1945, it got great reviews and a lot of people fell in love with it — and still love it. That’s not a cult.) Nor was “seeing a Balanchine premiere an indispensable part of being culturally au courant, of understanding the zeitgeist”; it was something you did because Balanchine was so important to you that you couldn’t wait to see his latest effort. But then Dery is a self-proclaimed “cultural critic,” and cultural critics tend to deal in zeitgeists, not art. For those in New York in search of Gorey’s work, the place to go was the famous Midtown bookstore the Gotham Book Mart (“Wise Men Fish Here”). There, piled up next to the cash register, could be found his latest productions, and there he was championed by the original owner, the imperious Frances Steloff, and her successor, Andreas Brown, who eventually took charge of Gorey’s business affairs. It was Brown who insisted on putting together the very popular “Amphigorey” anthologies that, even if the crowded format diminished the subtle effects of the individual volumes, brought Gorey out of the cold and, along the way, made him a considerable amount of money. And it was Brown who, when a theater producer wanted to translate Gorey’s modest Cape Cod production of “Dracula” to Broadway, strong-armed Ted into agreeing, exacting a huge advance plus “points” (that is, a percentage of the profits) and thereby making him financially secure for life. Gratifying, of course, but Gorey hated the fact that the “Edward Gorey Production of Dracula” simply enlarged his original set designs rather than substituting newly designed ones appropriate to the larger scale. When he first saw them, he told Dick Cavett in an extended interview, “I practically had cardiac arrest, is what I practically had.” (The Tony he won for “Dracula” — for costumes, bizarrely, not sets — he gave to a friend.) Image A “rather odd” couple from “The Listing Attic,” 1954.CreditEdward Gorey Brown’s merchandising of Gorey products presses on successfully today, with calendars, bookmarks, T-shirts, postcards, mugs — you name it! — widely available. Dery, however, takes potshots at Brown and his co-trustee of the now very rich Edward Gorey Charitable Trust, especially for their handling of the immense Gorey archive. Not coincidentally, perhaps, Brown would not sit for an official interview for “Born to Be Posthumous.” Nor did the two friends to whom Gorey left $100,000 each in his will: Connie Joerns and the dance critic Robert Greskovic, whom Dery barely mentions. And yet he boasts in his “note on sources” of the “more than 78 in-depth interviews with people who’d known Gorey, each of which was recorded and transcribed to ensure accuracy.” What does he think biographers do? He’s also proud of having “tracked down the addresses Gorey called home during his Chicago boyhood.” If only he hadn’t! At times his passion for detail is just bewildering. Did we need to know that Bobbs-Merrill, the publishing house where Gorey spent a “dreary” year, was located at 3 West 57th Street? Dery isn’t an experienced biographer, so it’s understandable that he stumbles. But he is an experienced writer, and although parts of his Gorey book are persuasively written — as are the bulk of the essays in his collection, “I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts” — the new book is so swamped in clichés that I kept being reminded of the famous pieces Frank Sullivan wrote for The New Yorker about a fictional Mr. Arbuthnot, “the cliché expert.” People in the Dery universe pound the pavement and keep an eye peeled, books both fly off the racks and roll off the presses, letters fly thick and fast, things speak volumes, are grist for the Freudian mills and do a land-office business (in no time flat). And, speaking of The New Yorker, Dery seems fixated on it — why else, when referring to a profile of Gorey by Stephen Schiff, does he identify him nine times as writing in the magazine? And speaking yet again of The New Yorker, why doesn’t Dery capitalize its “The”? Where, indeed, are the copy editors at his generally excellent publisher, Little, Brown? By the mid-80s, once Gorey was permanently installed in his house in Yarmouth Port, his books had become somewhat predictable and thin — more manner than content. “Gone,” Dery accurately reports, “was the spiderweb delicacy of his classic style, replaced by a thicker, bolder line. Gone, too, were the eye-buzzing pattern-on-pattern compositions and dizzily detailed wallpaper of his heyday, exchanged for monochrome backdrops.” One gets the feeling that he was going through the motions. Alexander Theroux, author of the interesting if factually precarious “The Strange Case of Edward Gorey,” told an interviewer that, in around 1990, Gorey had told him that “he’d lost his talent.” But he was enjoying his life. His enduring fascination with theater had gripped him again, and he was the driving force behind countless amateur plays, puppet shows and revues that absorbed most of his time and energy and gave him endless pleasure — sometimes more pleasure than they gave his local audiences. His tastes in his later years were if anything wider and seemingly more than ever incompatible with one another. Genji and Mozart and Balanchine, yes, but also “Buffy” and “Golden Girls” and “All My Children.” As for movies, he venerated the glorious silent serials of Feuillade and the masterpieces of Ozu and Naruse but he also indulged happily in the most graphic splatter films. When asked whether these popular tastes reflected “a scholarly interest in American pop culture,” he answered, “No, I just like trash.” Similarly, his highly personal collections, mostly culled from yard sales, extended to worn stuffed animals, telephone pole insulators, rocks and old machinery (“I just like rusted iron”). As for success, after “Dracula” he said, “I began to realize what it would be like to be rich and famous, but I’ve decided unh-unh.” In this, he uncannily resembles Paul Taylor. In other words, he un-self-consciously and firmly lived by his own lights — a perfect example of the “inner-directed man” of David Riesman’s “The Lonely Crowd.” An admiring Dick Cavett put it this way: “You have done exactly, as I see it, what you want to do.” To which Gorey, true to form, replied: “Well, I guess I have. But only because I didn’t really see any way of doing anything else.” He even died his own way, stubbornly refusing to take standard precautionary measures that would almost certainly have postponed the heart attack that killed him in 2000. His way baffled a lot of people, because there weren’t a lot of people like him. Chris Seufert, who filmed him for a documentary, said: “My background in anthropology really was appropriate. My sense, shooting him, was that he was indeed the last of a disappearing race. … But the thing with Edward was, there was no race. He was the most one-of-a-kind person you’d ever meet.” His mother, candid as always, summed things up this way: “But then, Ted always did puzzle me.” Robert Gottlieb’s most recent books are “Avid Reader,” a memoir, and “Near-Death Experiences … and Others,” a collection of essays.

arts Opinion | How to Apologize (Better) - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Opinion|How to Apologize (Better) Opinion Supported by How to Apologize (Better) By Margaret Renkl Contributing Writer June 4, 2018 Image A day after her show was canceled as the result of an insensitive tweet she had written, Roseanne Barr was back on Twitter, writing posts that swung from apologetic to combative.CreditCreditGetty Images NASHVILLE — A kid can pick up some handy information in Catholic school. The words to heartening songs. An understanding that human worth is inherent, unyoked to public accolades. The power of service over the power of self-gratification. A kid can pick up some not-so-handy information in Catholic school, too, but let’s save that discussion for another essay. One of the most useful things Catholic school taught me is the fundamental structure of apology. Whether or not you accept the notion of original sin in its most literal sense — I don’t — it’s impossible not to notice that we’re all born with a powerful inclination for fault and failure. We lie. We treat others unkindly. We nurture wrongheaded notions because they make us feel a little bit better about our imperfect selves. Roman Catholic catechism calls this tendency “the sinful condition,” but here in the 21st century, it’s more usefully known as being born a human being. We live in the Age of Outrage, a time when any public act of poor judgment is met with public fury. (Think of the case, just last week, of Roseanne Barr’s racist tweet.) That first round of fury is followed swiftly by more fury as new voices defend the pilloried one. Tweet something stupid, and it must follow as the night the day that Twitter will erupt with partisan howls on every possible side, right on up to the aggrieved tweeter in chief, who is clearly thriving in the Age of Outrage. One problem with the electronic whipping post is that people, no matter how patently flawed themselves, are disinclined to allow a flawed but truly remorseful person the room it takes to reform. A much bigger problem, though, lies with the offenders themselves, whose apologies ring hollow because they almost always involve some variety of self-justification. To be fair, a social media feed or press release is hardly a window to the soul. But among the higher profile cases, there is plenty to suggest that almost no one in public life knows what it means to be truly remorseful. Or at least how to express remorse. Here is what Ms. Barr said about her tweet last week: “It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting.” (Sanofi, the maker of Ambien, posted its own tweet to set the record straight: “While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects,” it read, “racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.”) Here is what the “Today Show” host Matt Lauer said about his #MeToo scandal: “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.” Here is what the NBC journalist Brian Williams initially said in a 2015 interview with Mr. Lauer, after being caught in a monstrous, oft-told lie: “I am sorry for what happened.” As though the lie had simply befallen him, independent of his own volition. When the Food Network fired celebrity chef Paula Deen for using a racist epithet, Ms. Deen told Mr. Lauer — yes, him again — she was sorry for the epithet but was not herself a racist. “Would I have fired me? Knowing me? No.” (No word on whether she would have fired Mr. Lauer.) To their credit, these public figures all issued much more comprehensive and seemingly heartfelt apologies later on, although Ms. Barr appeared to retract hers following an outpouring of support from conservatives, including the president. (“You guys make me feel like fighting back,” she tweeted. “I will examine all of my options carefully.”) If you are a Catholic of a certain age, you grew up reciting the Act of Contrition every day, and you thereby learned some things about remorse. (Maybe you learned only the language of remorse, but still: “We are what we pretend to be,” as Kurt Vonnegut observed.) “O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishments, but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin.” A child who learns these words learns that an apology consists of four parts: 1) Genuine remorse (not “I don’t remember it that way” but “I am truly, wholeheartedly sorry.”) 2) The expectation of unpleasant but entirely deserved consequences (not “I wouldn’t have fired me” but “I’m seeking help to confront my racism.”) 3) A resolution not to commit the same error again (not “I’m not as bad as some of these stories suggest” but “I’m much worse than I ever imagined, and I plan to devote the rest of my life to making amends.”) 4) A sincere effort to avoid the circumstances that led to the error in the first place (not “I won’t take Ambien any more” but “I will no longer hang out online with racists.”) The moral imperative of the Act of Contrition has its limitations, of course, starting with the question of who gets to decide what might offend God. (“You can safely assume that you’ve created God in your own image,” Anne Lamott famously pointed out, “when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.”) And God knows the world is still waiting for the Catholic Church to apologize for some criminal errors of its own. The prayer is nevertheless a good basic template for something that no longer seems basic at all: knowing how to clean up a mess of your own making. When a person causes egregious offense, the appropriate response isn’t damage control. The appropriate response is a genuine apology — not because you might get your TV show back but because to acknowledge a mistake is to participate fully in the human community. We all mess up. We all see through blinders. We all say hurtful things. We all nurture prejudices we don’t recognize in ourselves. It isn’t necessary to think of these tendencies as being part of a sinful nature to understand that they are endemic to human life. Even a full-throated apology won’t erase a colossal mistake. We will never make ourselves perfect. But we can try to make ourselves better, and the culture we live in, too. Margaret Renkl is a contributing opinion writer.

By Kristina Marie Darling Dec. 7, 2018 WE BEGIN IN GLADNESS How Poets Progress By Craig Morgan Teicher 164 pp. Graywolf Press. Paper, $16. The title of Craig Morgan Teicher’s new book, “We Begin in Gladness,” comes from a poem by William Wordsworth: “We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.” These lines have come to embody a cliché about poets’ downward emotional trajectories over the course of their careers, as if, writes Teicher, himself an accomplished poet, “writing poems and looking too long at the trials of the human mind and heart in a troubled world beckon poets to their undoing.” He acknowledges the great poets of the last century who “met terrible ends” at the mercy of deteriorating mental health (among them Sylvia Plath, Randall Jarrell and John Berryman), but insists, quoting the critic Joan Acocella, that “it is a species of sentimentality to think that the end of something tells the truth about it.” Teicher proposes a well-reasoned alternative: to read poets not so much by their experiences but by the evolution of their words — “by their journeys, by how their art grew and changed over the course of their writing lives.” Image In this thoughtful book, he does just that, contemplating a range of poets, from Plath (whose work he wants to rescue from the retrospective weight of her suicide) to francine j. harris (whose experimental verse, often about racism and her life in Detroit, frequently avoids conventions of grammar and punctuation and can have an improvised feel). Early on, Teicher declares that to truly understand poets’ work, we need to “become them, or, more impossibly, to have been them.” He has to settle for less intimate modes of comprehension, including, for instance, the concept of “apprenticeship,” which provides a useful lens for considering questions of influence and transformation. Teicher frames the experimental poet Brenda Hillman’s forays into Gnostic philosophy — an ancient mystical tradition within Christianity — as the impetus for a poetic breakthrough that allowed her to become “the metaphysical poet she was striving to be, and also to think deeply about the relationship between the realms of imagination and of experience.” And he excavates the collision of influences in W. S. Merwin’s work, which range from ancient Chinese poetry to Pre-Raphaelite painting and culminate in the masterly late poems of “The Shadow of Sirius,” a meditation on the nature of time. “Merwin locates himself in an ongoing stream of losses,” Teicher observes, taking “a wide view of time, the kind of wide view one would need a lifetime to take.” Teicher perceptively identifies the philosophical undercurrents in much of 20th- and 21st-century poetry and highlights important patterns of poetic influence. Yet he tends to neglect another key part of any poet’s development: the awakening of his or her political sensibility. He overlooks, for example, the fact that for poets like Plath and Louise Glück and Susan Wheeler, inhabiting — and substantively revising — a predominantly masculine creative tradition was itself a political act. For francine j. harris, politics are inextricable from her work’s philosophical concerns. Since the publication of her first book, “allegiance,” harris has been praised for her attention to (and criticism of) the aesthetics of violation. In her poem “katherine with the lazy eye. short. and not a good poet,” she writes in the voice of a young woman addressing an acquaintance — a fellow poet — who has been found dead: “i didn’t like you. this is the first i remembered your name.” In Teicher’s view, the poem’s title betrays a fear its speaker harbors about herself; the poem is a “cautionary” tale, a road “thankfully not taken.” But this reading makes abstract the palpable threat of the “empty woodsy highways” that surround the poem’s speaker and of her identification with the dead woman, who seems much like herself. By overlooking questions of social justice and the politics of language, Teicher offers us a portrait of these poets that, however well rendered, is nevertheless incomplete. Kristina Marie Darling’s next book, “Look to Your Left: The Poetics of Spectacle,” will be published in 2020.

arts ‘Deal or No Deal’ Gets a Revival, but Should Its Bevy of 26 Models? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|‘Deal or No Deal’ Gets a Revival, but Should Its Bevy of 26 Models? Supported by ‘Deal or No Deal’ Gets a Revival, but Should Its Bevy of 26 Models? Image The TV game show “Deal or No Deal” returned on Dec. 5 after a nearly 10-year absence, and so did its 26 “briefcase girls.” But a lot has changed since it went off the air in 2009.CreditCreditJeff Daly/CNBC By Lara Zarum Dec. 7, 2018 Game shows are as old as television, and for as long as they have existed, producers have decorated their sets with beautiful women who don’t say much but just might make your dreams come true. Perhaps nowhere has that format proved more tenacious than on CNBC’s “Deal or No Deal,” which returned for a new season Wednesday after a nearly 10-year hiatus, and features 26 female models in matching high heels and short, skintight dresses. It’s a formula that helped make “Deal” a prime-time hit when it debuted on NBC in 2005. That was 13 years ago. But in 2018, as the culture continues to grapple with the way women have been disregarded and sometimes abused by Hollywood and its machers, “Deal” and shows like it raise an awkward question: Is this a convention whose time is up? [Read our critics’ list of the year’s best TV including new series, streaming and foreign fare.] Series like “Deal” encapsulate the paradox of the modern game-show modeling gig: On one hand, it offers a stiletto-heeled foot in the door for many young women who aspire to careers in entertainment — Meghan Markle and Chrissy Teigen, among others, got their starts on “Deal or No Deal.” Image The host of “Deal or No Deal,” Howie Mandel. Historically, most game-shows with female models have been hosted by an authoritative man in a suit.CreditJeff Daly/CNBC Vanna White, who has been turning letters on “Wheel of Fortune” since 1983, has shaped that gig into a long, multifaceted career. “I’ve turned what I’ve been a part of for 36 years into other things, and I don’t feel any lower than Pat Sajak,” she said, referring to her male co-host. “I feel equal to him.” On the other hand, it is unclear whether those advantages are worth the broader message it may communicate in the wake of #MeToo. “I do feel it’s a bit tone deaf,” said Nicole Martins, a professor at Indiana University Bloomington who focuses on media and body image. “These women are used as eye candy, and it reinforces the idea that these women should be appreciated for how they look.” Things have changed since the days of “Barker’s Beauties” on “The Price Is Right,” named for the show’s older male host, Bob Barker. Yet, despite profound changes in television, hot girls in heels holding and gesturing to objects have remained a staple of contest programming. Image Early game shows like “Queen for a Day” established the format in which a male host is aided by models, who rarely if ever speak. Jack Bailey, center, was that show’s host.CreditEverett Collection The earliest game shows, like the popular 1950s program “Queen for a Day,” featured models posing in fur coats and gowns and holding prizes next to wide grins. Carol Merrill, the model on the original run of “Let’s Make a Deal,” from 1963 to 1977, said she grew up watching shows like “Queen for a Day.” “I’d see the gals and they’d be holding the products close to their faces and smiling into the camera,” she said, “and I really never knew their names.” That began to change while Merrill was on “Let’s Make a Deal.” That show’s host, Monty Hall, said her full name each time he called on her, making her the first game-show model to become a household name. Although Merrill didn’t wear a microphone, hearing her name over and over piqued the audience’s curiosity. “We got letters saying, ‘Can she talk, even?’” Merrill said. In response, the writers planned a kind of gag for the show’s 2,500th episode: Hall asked Merrill a couple of questions, and Merrill finally spoke. And spoke. Image The host Monty Hall and the model Carol Merrill of “Let’s Make a Deal,” 1968. Hall spoke Merrill’s full name each time he called on her, making her a household name.CreditThe Denver Post, via Getty Images “I talked and I talked, like I am now,” she said, “and they went away to a commercial and they came back and I was still talking.” For as long as game shows have existed, so has the tendency of many to reinforce gender stereotypes. Early entries like “Queen for a Day,” “Supermarket Sweep,” and “Missus Goes-a-Shopping” confined female contestants to the role of homemaker, competing to win a cart full of groceries or a new baby crib. Invariably these shows were — and for the most part, still are — hosted by authoritative men in suits. Elana Levine, a professor of media studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has studied the sexualized role of women in American television, sees the persistence of the game-show model is a bow to nostalgia. As these programs reboot for new generations, the models are a comfortingly consistent feature. “But game shows are about winning money or commercial goods, and the figure of the spokesmodel is very much part of that,” Levine added. “She’s kind of on display as another product.” Image The host Bob Barker with Janice Pennington, left, and Anitra Ford in 1972. Pennington and Ford were among the models on the show, referred to as “Barker’s Beauties.”CreditCBS On “Deal or No Deal,” that display is ostentatious. At the top of each show, its host, Howie Mandel, greets the throng of models: “Hello, ladies!” The women reply in singsong unison: “Hi, Howie.” Each “briefcase girl” holds a case containing a dollar amount between $1 and $1 million, which she reveals at the contestant’s request. The models themselves often have a more positive perspective, and their role is generally more evolved than it once was. In the revived version of “Deal or No Deal,” they interact more with the contestants than in the previous version, and when they speak, their full names and Twitter handles appear onscreen. Mahogany Lox, a model on the revival, said the producers encouraged the women to be themselves. A singer and a D.J. (her grandfather is the Motown founder, Berry Gordy), she released a single last month titled “No Deal.” “They want your personality to shine and for you to connect with the people,” she said. Game-show fixtures like Merrill and White helped popularize the idea that a TV model could be more than just a pretty face. Officially, White is Sajak’s co-host on “Wheel of Fortune.” But she faced derision early on for the perceived simplicity of her job. Image Vanna White and Pat Sajak have hosted “Wheel of Fortune” together since 1983. White has parlayed her role into pop icon status and several lucrative spokeswoman gigs.CreditABC, via Everett Collection “I was put down quite a bit for that in the beginning,” she said. That role has been a mostly silent one. (When White published a memoir in 1987, she called it “Vanna Speaks!”) But White has used the visibility to her advantage, building her status as a public personality and pop-culture icon. That has included lucrative spokeswoman gigs for companies like Spring Air mattresses and Lion Brand yarn, which designed White — an avid knitter — her own line. Historically, the game-show-model format has exposed glaring inequalities, both onscreen and off. Kathleen Bradley, who in 2014 published a memoir about her experiences on “The Price is Right,” became the first long-term African-American game-show model when she was cast — in 1990. But despite her 10-year presence on the show, she and her fellow models were never offered proper contracts, working week-to-week. “Price” and Barker were accused of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination in multiple lawsuits in the 1990s. (Barker has denied the accusations.) The former “Price” model Gwendolyn Osborne-Smith said there was a sea change in the dynamic between host and model when Drew Carey replaced Barker in 2007. She recalled being present during an interview when Carey was asked what he wanted the models to be called, now that they were no longer “Barker’s Beauties.” Image From left, the announcer Rich Fields, the host Drew Carey and the model Manuela Arbelaez, Amber Lancaster, Lanisha Cole, Gwendolyn Osborne and Rachel Reynolds of “The Price Is Right.” The dynamic between host and model is said to have changed significantly since Carey took over from Barker.CreditArt Streiber/CBS, via Getty Images “And he said, ‘They’re not mine,’” Osborne-Smith said. “‘They’re their own people, and you can call them by their names.’” The models felt freer to be themselves during interviews after that, she said. By 2010, the models of “Price” were wearing microphones on set — with Carey, they became more like a sitcom ensemble, bantering with the host and the contestants. In 2012, the show hired its first male model, and it now has two regular male models, James O’Halloran and the former N.F.L. player Devin Goda. Bradley said she welcomed the changes. “They have incorporated the models much more into the show, which is great,” she said. “I like how they have them speak.” Mike Richards, the executive producer of “Price is Right,” said his biggest challenge was to balance respecting the tradition of a long-running series with making a show that felt current. “I’ve been on the show 10 years now,” Richards said, “and everything we’ve done is threading that needle, whether it’s changing the set, the lighting, the prizes, new games, redoing old games, how the models and the announcer are used. We the producers don’t take any of it for granted.” Levine, the Wisconsin media professor, argued that the tradition’s value was not self-evident. “This is the way game shows have been for a long time,” she said. “That doesn’t mean it’s not still really sexist, and really troubling that this is the way for a young woman to establish herself.” Related Coverage The Best TV Shows of 2018Dec. 3, 2018 Image You Think It’s Easy to Schlep Those Cases in Four-Inch Heels?Feb. 13, 2008 Image OpinionDaphna Joel and Cordelia Fine Can We Finally Stop Talking About ‘Male’ and ‘Female’ Brains?Dec. 3, 2018 Image Bob Barker Gives CBS a Good GoodbyeJune 19, 2007 Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more Reader Center Wirecutter The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more Reader Center Wirecutter The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword Cooking email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2018 The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions

Representatives for Spears said her father’s colon spontaneously ruptured, causing him to spend 28 days in the hospital. “We’re all so grateful that he came out of it alive, but he still has a long road ahead of him,” the singer wrote. “We have a very special relationship and I want to be with my family at this time just like they have always been there for me.” I don’t even know where to start with this, because this is so tough for me to say. I will not be performing my new show Domination. I’ve been looking forward to this show and seeing all of you this year, so doing this breaks my heart. pic.twitter.com/kHgFAVTjNA— Britney Spears (@britneyspears) January 4, 2019 Jamie Spears has played an outsize role in his daughter’s music and merchandising career since 2008, after she suffered an infamous and prolonged public breakdown. Since then, her father and a lawyer, Andrew Wallet, have overseen Spears’s life and finances via a court-approved conservatorship, known sometimes as a guardianship, designed for people who cannot take care of themselves — typically the old, the infirm and the mentally disabled. (Though much of Spears’s arrangement is kept private in a Los Angeles probate court because of her fame, filings have cited an undisclosed mental illness and substance abuse as the reasons for the decade-long conservatorship.) Spears, one of the best-selling artists of all time, last released an album, “Glory,” in 2016. Though she has also toured and appeared on television since the conservatorship took effect, Spears’s primary project in recent years has been a tightly controlled, greatest hits Las Vegas residency. Beginning in 2013, “Britney: Piece of Me” ran for four years at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, grossing a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows. Traditionally the domain of performers in the twilight of their careers, Vegas residencies have become a more common revenue source for pop acts since the success of shows by Spears and Celine Dion, with similar productions in recent years from Jennifer Lopez, Gwen Stefani and the Backstreet Boys. Lady Gaga’s “Enigma” residency will run at the Park MGM throughout this year. Representatives for Spears said “Domination” was “on hold until further notice,” but added that Jamie Spears was expected to make a full recovery. In October, Wallet, the lawyer and co-conservator, cited the expected success of the new Vegas show as he requested his fee for overseeing Spears’s business be raised to $426,000 a year. He said in court filings that the singer’s estate, which had been “nearly out of funds,” had raised its worth to at least $20 million since 2014, because of the singer’s “increased well being and her capacity to be engaged.” He added, “The next several years promise to be very lucrative.” Related Coverage The 28 Best Albums of 2018Dec. 6, 2018 Image Is Britney Spears Ready to Stand on Her Own?May 4, 2016 Image Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword Cooking email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2019 The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions

Kelly, has faced accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse. This week, a six-part documentary on Lifetime is taking an expansive look at the allegations against Mr. Kelly, a chart-topping artist whose history has invited extra scrutiny in recent years. The series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” includes testimony from several women who accuse the singer of abuse, as well as commentary from Mr. Kelly’s critics, including the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke, and the singer John Legend. The six episodes, each an hour long, cover the long history of allegations against Mr. Kelly. They feature women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers, as well as associates and relatives of the singer. Mr. Kelly has continuously denied the allegations against him. The documentary has become the subject of widespread attention and fierce debate on social media, with many expressing gratitude to the women who continue to tell their stories. “I wish that he would experience a kind of social death, and that people who still vociferously declare him innocent — or their favorite artist, or worthy of having his work separated from who he is — that they are denied that,” said dream hampton, an executive producer of the documentary. The six parts of the series were scheduled over three days of broadcast, from Thursday through Saturday. The third and fourth episodes focused on Mr. Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial and the sex tape at its center. The fifth and sixth episodes examine more recent allegations and follow parents who were trying to free their daughters from Mr. Kelly’s influence, Ms. hampton said. While some fans of Mr. Kelly still defend him, many critics say that he has escaped the consequences of his actions for far too long. “No one cared because we were black girls,” the writer Mikki Kendall said in the documentary. [Here is a timeline of the accusations against Mr. Kelly.] Ms. hampton agreed that race was an integral part of this story. She added that black boys and girls in the United States were often perceived as older than they are, and mentioned Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by a police officer in Cleveland in 2014. “We know black boys are perceived to be older than they are by police, and we absolutely do an equivalent thing to black girls,” Ms. hampton said in an interview Friday. “We perceive them to be more sexual at an early age. We perceive them to be older. And that is rooted — there is no other way to say it, and it’s not hyperbole to say — it’s absolutely rooted in this country’s history of slavery, which has gone on longer than it hasn’t.” Mr. Kelly was still featured as an artist on the RCA website on Saturday. The label did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a representative for Sony Music, which oversees RCA Records, declined to comment. Mr. Kelly’s management also declined to comment. His team has previously said it would “vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.” Mr. Kelly is not currently facing criminal charges. In 1994, when Mr. Kelly was 27, he married Aaliyah Haughton, who was 15 but was listed as 18 on a wedding certificate, according to Vibe Magazine. The marriage was annulled in 1995. Ms. Haughton, who was a popular singer in her own right, died in a plane crash in 2001. Mr. Kelly was accused of having sex with a teenager in a lawsuit in 1996, and again in 2001. Both lawsuits were settled, but the music critic Jim DeRogatis, who reported on them, continued to investigate the accusations against Mr. Kelly.

Kelly claim that during the 1990s and 2000s, associates of the famous singer knew that he liked to prey on underage girls. In 2002, a video that appeared to show Mr. Kelly having sex with a teenage girl and urinating in her mouth was sent to Mr. DeRogatis at The Chicago Sun-Times, which reported that the footage was being investigated by the Chicago police. Later that year, Mr. Kelly was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago for child pornography. He pleaded not guilty, and for more than five years his case did not make it to trial. During that time he released albums including “Chocolate Factory,” which contained the chart-topping song “Ignition (Remix).” Arguments in the 2008 trial centered on whether the man shown in the video was indeed Mr. Kelly, and whether the girl’s identity or her age could be verified. The jury decided that the girl, who did not testify, could not be identified, and Mr. Kelly was found not guilty. In the documentary, one juror was asked about the women who had said, during the trial, that they also were victimized by Mr. Kelly when they were young. “I just didn’t believe them, the women,” the juror answered. “I know it sounds ridiculous. The way they dress, the way they act — I didn’t like them.” Image R. Kelly waved to fans while being escorted from Cook County Court in Chicago in 2002.CreditCharles Bennett/Associated Press For years after the trial, Mr. Kelly continued to perform. In 2017, an article by Mr. DeRogatis in BuzzFeed News reported on allegations that the singer was controlling several young women by taking away their phones and limiting contact with their families. That same year, a campaign of protests, in person and on social media under the hashtag #MuteRKelly, began to pick up steam. In 2018, Spotify announced that it would remove Mr. Kelly from its official playlists, though his music would remain on the streaming platform. A screening of the Lifetime documentary in Manhattan last month was called off after anonymous threats were called in to the venue, CNN reported. The documentary’s producers include Ms. hampton, Tamra Simmons, Brie Miranda Bryant, Joel Karsberg and Jesse Daniels, according to Lifetime. Some of the people featured in the documentary, including Mr. Legend and the columnist Jamilah Lemieux, have pointed people to organizations like A Long Walk Home, a Chicago-based nonprofit working to end violence against girls and women; and Girls for Gender Equity, a nonprofit that has created a guide for viewers of the documentary, including those who are survivors of sexual assault.

arts Five Great Podcasts From 2018 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Arts Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Arts|Five Great Podcasts From 2018 Supported by Five Great Podcasts From 2018 Image We may not have reached peak podcast yet, but we can’t be too far off. With so many new downloads to wade through, putting together a definitive list of this year’s best seemed an impossible task. And do you really need us to tell you that the new season of “Serial” returns the show to its excellent, addictive heights? (For the record, it does.) Instead, we asked our critics to crack open their phones and share the shows that truly clicked with them this year. THE SONIC DEEP DIVE ‘Dissect’ Most great art refuses to let your appreciation hit bottom. The bottomlessness is part of what lures you back. That painting, movie, play, book, star never stops giving. But Cole Cuchna’s album podcast, “Dissect,” actually attempts to bottom out, close-reading great records with college-lecture authority and autograph-hound zeal. Season one unpacked Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly.” Season two dismantled Kanye West’s “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.” It’s this most recent third season, though — oriented around most of Frank Ocean’s discography — that really let the show flash its forensic plumage. See, Cuchna is more than a music nerd. He’s a scuba artist, deep-diving into Ocean’s art and emerging with little bits of treasure, which he delivers in a congested monotone. It isn’t just Cuchna’s assumed assertion that Ocean’s work is as bountifully ornate as Lamar’s or West’s. It’s that the show, which is now being produced by Spotify, thrives as an achievement of contemplative audio. The show’s time with Ocean’s debut, “Channel Orange,” makes leaps of interpretive wonder, followed by long stretches of corroborating music clips. Maybe the allusions to color on a song like “Pink Matter” mean this. Or maybe they mean that. Sometimes the combination of insights adds up to one possibility. But what’s especially revelatory about the Frank Ocean episodes — but, really, Cuchna’s entire project — is the way all this sleuthing isn’t about finding a final answer or a means to an end. It’s actually just another opening. No art or artist is ever fixed. And so the show still lets some of Ocean’s mystery be. — WESLEY MORRIS THE TRUE-CRIME SURPRISE ‘The City’ In some ways this is the stuff Chicago crime stories are typically made of: the mob, corrupt politicians, greed. But the first season of “The City,” a new long-form podcast series from USA Today, is far more surprising than that, also encompassing themes of class, gentrification and environmental racism. The show’s creator and host, Robin Amer, plus a team of investigative journalists, dig into the story of North Lawndale, a predominantly black working-class neighborhood that became the site of illegal waste dumping in the early 1990s. Over the course of 10 episodes, “The City” details the many ways residents tried to force politicians to address the issue, and the many ways they were routinely ignored or dismissed. As the accounts of severe health problems resulting from the waste build up, and the narrative zooms out to include the F.B.I. and then-Mayor Richard M. Daley, it’s both an infuriating and mesmerizing listen. — AISHA HARRIS smart girl talk ‘The Cut on Tuesdays’ In the growing ecosystem of podcasts for women, a few typical forms have crystallized. There is the panel of feminist thinkers; the interview with a lady boss; the conversation between friends. “The Cut on Tuesdays,” a new show from New York Magazine’s women’s site, “The Cut,” offers a surprise: It is a wide-ranging critical essay in podcast form. Shepherded by the host Molly Fischer, who is a natural, this show has inherited the impeccable taste of its parent site. It’s informed by feminism but not hamstrung by ideology. It’s self-aware but not indulgent. It is clever enough to avoid the rhetorical traps that lay about the women’s content business: It seems uninterested in either one-note outrage or hyper-positive empowerment. All of this helps it make even an old saw feel sharp. Recently the show took on a debate that’s been raging among feminists for 40 years — pubic hair, or the lack thereof — and capably argued that for all the popular discussion of its symbolism, there is precious little talk about the stuff itself. So it convened a diverse group of women — some expert, some anonymous — to talk about their own. “The Cut” is a rare thing: a pure pleasure, not at all a guilty one. — AMANDA HESS THE page-turner ‘Lethal Lit: A Tig Torres Mystery’ Tig Torres, a high school junior, has a true crime podcast. Its purpose: To discover the true identity of the Lit Killer, the well-read murderer who terrorized Tig’s hometown, Hollow Falls, a decade ago. Trouble is, the Lit Killer is listening in. And he or she wants Tig on permanent hiatus. This never happens to Sarah Koenig! A digital-native Nancy Drew bristling with wit, snark and vocal fry, Tig is the creation of comics writers Alex Segura and Monica Gallagher. Each episode (there are six in the first season of “Lethal Lit”) is structured as a podcast within a podcast as Tig and her classmates narrate their investigations, searching for clues in battered copies of “Lord of the Flies” and “The Great Gatsby.” Call it nerd-pride noir. The vocal talent is variable, but the writing is savvy, the nods to genre are droll and the cliffhangers — don’t go into the abandoned amusement park, Tig! — just about unbearable. — ALEXIS SOLOSKI THE courthouse saga ‘In the Dark’ The injustices within the justice system are manifold, and Season 2 of “In the Dark” examines a case whose specifics defy both belief and morality. A Mississippi man named Curtis Flowers has been tried for the same crime six times, despite a lack of credible evidence against him, and this podcast methodically examines each facet of his case. The thoroughness of the reporting here is extraordinary. The show’s host and lead reporter, Madeleine Baran, brings the same clarity of purpose and vision to sifting through thousands of documents in an abandoned warehouse as she does to dismantling common misconceptions about ballistics. This isn’t a whodunit but rather an examination of power and the people who wield it, and it’s fascinating and devastating. — MARGARET LYONS The Best of 2018 The Best TV Shows of 2018 Another year brought another embarrassment of TV riches, as departing favorites gave way to audacious new series, and streaming services brought viewers a world of outstanding foreign fare.Dec. 3, 2018 The Best Movies of 2018 Our chief film critics single out a Mexican remembrance of things past and four American documentaries about the way we live now.Dec. 5, 2018 The 65 Best Songs of 2018 One-off collaborations, movie soundtracks and internet upstarts provided some of the most exciting music this year.

arts Dangerously Deep Sleep Is Contagious in ‘The Dreamers’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|Dangerously Deep Sleep Is Contagious in ‘The Dreamers’ Supported by Books of The Times Dangerously Deep Sleep Is Contagious in ‘The Dreamers’ By Dwight Garner Jan. 7, 2019 Image CreditCreditAlessandra Montalto/The New York Times The virus first presents itself, as do most of the iniquities in American life, at a college party. A girl feels unwell, leaves early, and falls asleep. What she takes is no little beer nap. She doesn’t wake up. The virus spreads further, in Karen Thompson Walker’s second novel, “The Dreamers,” at another dorm-room party a few days later. Peach-flavored wine, that vector for the transmission of all things hazardous to the human spirit, is consumed. Tequila is passed in shared shot glasses. Now we have, to borrow the title of a novel by the medical-thriller writer Robin Cook, a contagion. More students fall asleep, like flowers fainting in their vases. None will be woke, politically or otherwise, for a long time, if ever. Before long, hundreds of citizens of the small fictional town of Santa Lora, Calif., have been infected by this sleeping sickness. Helicopters and Humvees and news crews, the secondary symptoms of any catastrophe, arrive. A cordon sanitaire is established. H. L. Mencken said that the ideal way to knock down any infectious disease is to “shoot instantly every person who comes down with it.” The president in this novel isn’t going to order that to happen, is he? Doctors determine that these sleepers are dreaming intensely, as if taking part in a communal screening of a Stanley Kubrick movie. If and when they awaken, what news will they have to bring? Walker has a gift for spooling out these kinds of details, as if we are kittens and she is trailing string. It’s a gift she displayed in her best-selling and well-reviewed first novel, “The Age of Miracles” (2012). That book, narrated by a sixth-grade girl, was about what would happen if the earth’s rotation slowed and parts of the planet crisped up and bubbled, like the surface of a crème brûlée. I can’t say that I read “The Age of Miracles,” but I did listen to the audio version with my family on a long summer drive. We listened to half of it, at any rate. We didn’t return to the book for the drive home. It seemed awfully tepid, even to my children, for a novel about the likely end of the world. What spell “The Age of Miracles” did manage to cast was predicated on two aspects. For one, as Irving Kristol put it, the “premonition of apocalypse springs eternal in the human breast.” Tell me a story in which the world is ending and CNN is covering it, and I will sit and listen for a while. Image Karen Thompson WalkerCreditDan Hawk Photography LLC For another, Walker’s first novel tapped neatly into our fears about the melting of the permafrost. Global warming has a role to play in “The Dreamers,” too. There is drought in California, and the book’s fictional college sits by a lake that’s evaporating. Sunken boats and other ancient items emerge from the receding waters. One of the sleepers, a doomsday prepper with two young daughters, wakes from his long sleep and relates this premonition: “The oceans moved a hundred miles inland. Los Angeles was swallowed.” By fire, by water: Like Kenny in “South Park,” L.A. always takes it in the end. Walker needs to keep the plots of her novels spinning, like plates on sticks. When the action slows, you realize what a limited and sentimental novelist she too often is. “The Dreamers” introduces us to many characters, nearly all of them exceedingly nice. There’s Ben and Annie, young academics new to town, and their baby. There’s Catherine, a specialist in psychiatric disorders. There’s Mei, a college freshman, who is lonely until the contagion gives her life purpose: along with another student, she devotes herself to assisting others. There are Libby and Sara, the pre-teenage daughters of the doomsday prepper. To keep themselves sane, these girls take in animals that wander the streets, some still wearing leashes, while their owners slumber. None of these characters says or does an interesting thing. Anarchic instincts and impure thoughts are kept to the barest minimum. Minds race in neutral. Reading this book’s bland dialogue is like watching players on center court use dead tennis balls. Pillow-soft banalities amass in drifts: “Not everything that breaks can be repaired”; “He has seen it already, how a child can unite them but also divide”; “There are certain circumstances under which the changing of a diaper is a sacred act”; “The only way to tell some stories is with the oldest, most familiar words: This here, this is the breaking of a heart.” Implausibilities pile up, too. What kind of small town lets its children go trick-or-treating after 12 people have caught a possibly deadly disease and local hotels have filled with contagious-disease experts? The most promising voice in this novel briefly emerges early on and then disappears. That voice belongs to a collective narrator not unlike the one Jeffrey Eugenides employed in “The Virgin Suicides.” Listening to that voice, you can almost hear the novel this might have been. In this scene, a boy named Caleb approaches the parents of a child who is ill: “The girls watch him shake hands with Kara’s father. They watch the way he holds his Cubs cap at his side while he speaks to Kara’s mother. And the girls — every one of them — long to smooth his hair, which is sticking up on one side and sweaty from where the cap has been. “The girls love him right then for talking to those parents. They love him for knowing what to do.” Walker knows what to do when she’s sinking her initial hooks into her readers. But she’s such a mild writer here that a true sense of menace is never allowed to bloom. Follow Dwight Garner on Twitter: @DwightGarner. The Dreamers By Karen Thompson Walker 303 pages.

arts With a Centerpiece Like This, Who Needed Cake? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|With a Centerpiece Like This, Who Needed Cake? Supported by critic’s Pick With a Centerpiece Like This, Who Needed Cake? At the Frick, an exhibition devoted to Luigi Valadier, the Roman silversmith to popes, sovereigns and aristocrats. Image At the Frick Collection, a detail of a table centerpiece, or deser, made by Luigi Valadier in 1778. It is a mix of gilt bronze, enamel, colored marbles, amber, lapis lazuli, amethyst, garnets, ivory, and agate.CreditCreditMichael Bodycomb By Roberta Smith Dec. 27, 2018 Money can’t buy you everything, but in 18th-century Rome, it could underwrite some pretty amazing acquisitions: a shoebox-size, neo-Classical, gilt silver casket for your wine; a Rococo clock consisting almost entirely of vivacious curves (not a straight line anywhere); or an exquisite bronze miniature of a famous Greek sculpture like the Apollo Belvedere, just the thing for a royal study. On a more ambitious scale, surplus income might procure a complete gilt silver service for Mass in a private chapel or a large and astounding centerpiece called a deser, fit for banquets and made of small copies of temples from the Roman Forum in assorted marbles, semiprecious stones and antique cameos — each more gorgeous than the next. In all cases, the gilding of silver or bronze is done with gold, which creates a thin-skinned but luxurious radiance. These ostentatious items would all have come from the bustling workshop of Luigi Valadier (1726-1785), among the most sought-after of Roman silversmiths who was, as well, an outstanding draftsman, designer, goldsmith and sculptor in bronze. And “you,” to be clear, would have been a member of a princely Italian family — a Borghese, Chigi or Orsini — an emissary of the King of Sweden, Madame du Barry or perhaps the Roman Catholic Church, in need of half-size gilt bronze and silver saints for the High Altar of the Cathedral of Monreale in Sicily. Image A design for the Temple of Mercury (ca. 1778), by Valadier's workshop. Pen, ink and watercolor on paper.CreditSovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali; Museo Napoleonico The fruits of Valadier’s versatile talent and fluid style are arrayed through three increasingly exciting galleries at the Frick Collection, in the first museum exhibition devoted to the artist in the United States. Two very different objects greet you at the beginning of “Luigi Valadier: Splendor in Eighteenth-Century Rome.” One, relatively mundane, is an inventory of all the works, tools and materials from Valadier’s workshop, compiled after his death by his son Giuseppe, who collaborated with his father on some of the objects here. This document, acquired by the Frick in 2017, enabled art historians to reconstruct Valadier’s career and the remainder of his life’s works, whose survival rate seems to rise in direct proportion to its distance from Rome. It was crucial to the research of Alvar González-Palacios, a lifelong Valadier scholar who organized the exhibition with Xavier F. Salomon of the Frick and wrote its detailed catalog. Nearby stands the Herm of Bacchus, a showstopping sculpture Valadier and his workshop created in 1773 for the Palazzo Borghese in Rome that now resides in the city’s Galleria Borghese. The nearly columnar body is made of a rare colored marble called alabastro a rosa, whose patterns of red and white evoke flowers, clouds, pooling water and mountain ranges, while the serene, almost mask-like face of its bronze head confirms that Valadier’s love of antiquity was not an exercise in mere copying. Above this visage, the restlessness of a thick mass of hair adorned with a wreath of delicate ivy leaves balances the quiet agitation of the marble. This work movingly celebrates the equal collaboration that may be special to the decorative arts: between the power of natural materials and ingenious human skill that brings out their glory. Image The statues of six saints (ca. 1773) Valadier made of silver and gilt metals for the Cathedral of Monreale's altar.CreditMichael Bodycomb Image “Bas-Relief with the Crucifixion of St. Peter” (ca. 1770). Gilt bronze, lapis lazuli and silver.CreditMichael Bodycomb Image “Bacchus and Ariadne” (1780-85). Orta alabaster, bronze, and gilt bronze, ancient intaglios and cameos, crystal, ancient glass paste.CreditMichael Bodycomb Valadier’s career lasted only 25 years, a triumph brought down by a cardinal sin of the obscenely wealthy: the failure to pay bills. He was born to French parents in Rome, where his father, André (later Andrea), was a prominent goldsmith who trained Luigi, his eldest son, as Luigi would train Giuseppe, forming a three-generation dynasty. But while the workshop that Valadier established after his father’s death thrived, it was beset by soaring overhead and lagging receivables. The resulting stress seems to have become unbearable on Sept. 15, 1785, when Valadier, 59, threw himself into the Tiber and quickly drowned. This exhibition has three acts: Secular, Ecclesiastic and, for lack of a better word, Miraculous. The first gallery holds objects for the home, albeit exceptionally grand ones, accompanied by a number of excellent drawings by the metalsmith. The attractions here include a massive ten-sided table with a porphyry top and an elaborate base adorned with large gilt bronze masks of the four seasons. In contrast, an oil lamp is so attenuated that it resembles an exotic flowering plant, in silver. The light of its four candles were magnified by reflections in a curved piece of silver bobbing at the end of a wire, like part of a Calder mobile. Tools for snuffing or trimming wicks, and the like, dangle from the candelabra, along with a small bell for summoning servants when all else fails. The only other sign of real life is much grimmer. The survivor of a set of four silver soup tureens themed to the seasons is here; it symbolizes winter, with the sculpted handle of its lid depicting the crouching form of a little barefooted waif, the wind at her back, tending a brazier. It would be nice to think she ruined someone’s dinner. Image "Herm of Bacchus" (1773), in its home at the Galleria Borghese in Rome. Bronze, alabastro a rosa, bianco e nero antico and africano verde.CreditMauro Magliani Valadier’s gifts expand in the spare gallery of Ecclesiastic objects, first with a poignant silver relief of the crucifixion of Saint Peter, who gracefully opens his arms as if to greet heaven, while the background quivers with the contrasting textures of rocks and trees. Such marvels multiply in the six silver half-size sculptures of saints from the High Altar in the Monreale Cathedral. Here the faces register character and emotion above garments whose refined textures include fur, embroidered trim, fringe and ordinary cloth seemingly created by thousands of punches with a pinpoint. The show culminates in the Oval Room on the Frick’s ground floor, where the skills of Valadier’s workshop and his own love of antiquity are in full cry. The centerpiece, a deser tribute to the Roman Forum, occupies a long vitrine. It was frequently produced by Valadier’s workshop, but only three survive. This one, with five temples, two blocky triumphal arches, three obelisks and a decorated base, is the most complete. Having belonged to Charles V of Spain, it exists in two halves, each owned by museums in Madrid that are rarely united. The temples have stunning color combinations, like the lavender marble entablature with garnet swags on the Temple of Mercury. Antique cameos and intaglios abound in other decorations. A pediment is fit with a triangular ivory relief that must have adorned a miniature temple during ancient times. For further excursions in the antique, the deser is flanked by two large cameos each about 6 by 8 inches, one in stone, one in glass, both depicting Bacchus. For each, Valadier created small ornate marble frames resting on miniature gild lions. Distinguishing his elements from ancient ones is a fascinating guessing game that demonstrates one culture literally building on another, appropriating yet making something new. Empires come and go — but the decorative arts still cast their spell.

Mr. Mendes, the genial 19-year-old pop singer who got his start on Vine, easily scored his third straight No. 1 album on the Billboard chart this week with his self-titled third LP, topping the first-week results for ASAP Rocky and Pusha-T, whose back-and-forth with Drake generated plenty of chatter. “Shawn Mendes” (Island) earned a total of 182,000 album units, including 142,000 in sales and 50 million digital streams, according to Nielsen Music. (The album sales were helped along by a ticket-bundle deal that included the new release with tickets to Mr. Mendes’s tour.) The singer’s latest, which includes the current radio hit “In My Blood,” topped the first-week sales totals for his previous No. 1 albums, “Illuminate” in 2016 and “Handwritten” in 2015. Pusha-T’s “Daytona” (G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam) came in at No. 3 in its first week, falling short of Post Malone’s streaming smash “Beerbongs & Bentleys” (Republic), which was No. 2 in its fifth week out. “Daytona,” the Kanye West-produced album that included the lines that rekindled an increasingly personal battle with Drake, sold 39,000 albums and had 54 million streams, according to Nielsen, for a total of 77,000 album units. ASAP Rocky’s “Testing,” which dropped without a hit single or hip-hop drama but had an accompanying art installation, landed at No. 4 with 75,000 units (bolstered by 89 million streams), while Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy” held at No. 5 in its eighth week.

This Weekend Supported by 7 Classical Music Concerts to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend Image A scene from “4.48 Psychosis.”CreditCreditStephen Cummiskey/ROH By David Allen Jan. 3, 2019 Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ‘4.48 PSYCHOSIS’ at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (Jan. 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, 8 p.m.) It’s a mark of the Prototype Festival’s stature as a natural home for contemporary opera and music-theater that, from its scrappy origins only a few years ago, it is now hosting a production that had its premiere at Covent Garden in London. Philip Venables’s adaptation of Sarah Kane’s last play is directed by Ted Huffman and features William Cole conducting the ensemble Contemporaneous. 212-647-0251, prototypefestival.org BENJAMIN APPL at the Park Avenue Armory (Jan. 6, 3 p.m., Jan. 8 & 10, 7:30 p.m.) Appl is perhaps the leading young voice in the generation following on from the one dominated by Christian Gerhaher, and here he introduces himself in his North American recital debuts with the trilogy of late Schubert song cycles, sung in the plush Board of Officers Room: “Die Schöne Müllerin” on Sunday, “Schwanengesang” on Tuesday, and “Winterreise” on Thursday. James Baillieu is the pianist. 212-249-5518, armoryonpark.org ARTEK at Corpus Christi Church (Jan 10-11, 8 p.m.) Celebrating the completion of a recording, this excellent early music group gives a complete account spread over two nights of Book 7 the Madrigals by Monteverdi, a composer with whom they have had a long and productive relationship. 212-866-0468, gemsny.org ‘CARMEN’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 9, 8 p.m., through Feb. 8) Carmen returns to the Met’s stage for the second time this season, in Richard Eyre’s staging. The Carmen remains Clémentine Margaine, joined now by Roberto Alagna as Don José, Aleksandra Kurzak as Micaëla and Alexander Vinogradov as Escamillo. Louis Langrée conducts. 212-362-6000, metopera.org NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 10, 7:30 p.m., through Jan. 12) The up-and-coming conductor Jakub Hrusa is on the podium at the Philharmonic this week, and brings with him music from his native Czech Republic in the form of Charles Mackerras’ suite from Janacek’s “The Cunning Little Vixen.” Also on the bill are Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade” and Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No.3, with Simon Trpceski at the keyboard. 212-875-5656, nyphil.org ‘PARTITA FOR 8 VOICES’ in Times Square (Jan. 7, 4 p.m. & 7 p.m.) Caroline Shaw’s still-wondrous score, sung as ever by the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth, is staged in Times Square with free admission. Curated by Raul Zbengheci and directed by Ximena Garnica, the performance also features dancers from the Leimay Ensemble. 212-647-0251, prototypefestival.org ‘PRISM’ at La MaMa (Jan. 6-7, 9-12, 7:30 p.m.) In the course of praising this new opera — with a libretto by Roxie Perkins — upon its debut last November, the Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed wrote that the composer Ellen Reid “is a major voice thus far mainly recognized only in L.A.” Let us hope that changes with these performances, directed by James Darrah, and in the most competent of musical hands, with Julian Wachner conducting the Choir of Trinity Wall Street and NOVUS NY. 212-647-0251, prototypefestival.org Correction:  An earlier version of this article stated that Richard Baker would conduct the ensemble Contemporaneous for the performances of “4.48 Psychosis.” Because of an illness, he has been replaced by William Cole.

This Weekend Supported by 23 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend Image An installation view of “Painted in Mexico, 1700-1790: Pinxit Mexici,” which closes on Sunday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.CreditCreditCharlie Rubin for The New York Times July 19, 2018 Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘THOMAS BAYRLE: PLAYTIME’ at the New Museum (through Sept. 2). In the digital fever dream of Mr. Bayrle’s work, pixelated pictures twist and bend and resolve into fuzzily warped images. Abstract films and videos pulse with psychedelic patterns. But if Mr. Bayrle’s art seems like the ultimate in early computer design, most of the 115 paintings, prints, films and sculptures in his first major New York retrospective are actually handcrafted, generally using his signature “superform” of a large image made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller ones. Ultimately, Mr. Bayrle’s work instead offers a window into digital thinking or, it could be said, how we got to where we are now. (Martha Schwendener) 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org ‘HUMA BHABHA: WE COME IN PEACE’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 28). This spare and unsettling sculptural installation for the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden Commission includes two figures: one that is somewhat humanoid but with a ferocious mask-face and that visually dwarfs the jagged Manhattan skyline behind it, and another bowing in supplication or prayer, with long cartoonish human hands and a scraggly tail emerging from its shiny, black drapery. The title is a variant on the line an alien uttered to an anxious crowd in the 1951 science-fiction movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” but it ripples with other associations: colonization, invasion, imperialism or missionaries and other foreigners whose intentions were not always innocent. The installation also feels like an extension of the complex, cross-cultural conversation going on downstairs, inside a museum packed with 5,000 years of art history. (Schwendener) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘CANOVA’S GEORGE WASHINGTON’ at the Frick Collection (through Sept. 23). When Canova’s statue arrived in Raleigh, N.C., in 1821, the American press went wild for the likeness of the first president, wearing Roman military dress and drafting his farewell address, by the Italian neoclassical sculptor. Ten years later it was destroyed by fire — but the Frick has brought the full-scale plaster model of the lost statue over from Italy for this smashing show that reveals how European artists were inspired by American revolutionary ideals. Canova’s Washington, looming all alone over the Frick’s circular gallery, wears thickly curled hair instead of the pulled-back style he sports on the dollar bill, and in both his costume (leather skirt, strappy sandals) and his bearing, he embodies the ideals of the new republic, where principles come before power. Supplementary materials include a life mask of Washington and several smaller Canova models, including a nude Washington with some rather nice pecs. (Jason Farago) 212-288-0700, frick.org ‘THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests — in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows — served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met’s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a “sculpture” divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘GIACOMETTI’ at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through Sept. 12). This museum-filling outing for the signal sculptor of Western modernism is rather cautious — but revisionism can wait another day when the art looks as good as it does here. The Swiss artist’s witty and erotic early sculpture, such as the still-shocking “Disagreeable Object” (a phallic torture device with a spiked business end), enraptured the Surrealists in early 1930s Paris, but Giacometti was never content with an art of ideas, and in his filthy studio, he soon started making elongated, emaciated humanoids that have since become emblems of Europe’s postwar trauma. If you know Giacometti best for the bronzes that now go for obscene sums at auction, it’s a particular pleasure here to see his work in plaster, a medium he adored; the humility of the handwork testifies to his anxious mastery. (Farago) 212-423-3800, guggenheim.org ‘HEAVENLY BODIES: FASHION AND THE CATHOLIC IMAGINATION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Cloisters (through Oct. 8). Let us pray. After last year’s stark exhibition of Rei Kawakubo’s irregular apparel, the Met Costume Institute is back in blockbuster mode with this three-part blowout on the influence of Catholicism on haute couture of the last century. The trinity of fashion begins downstairs at the Met with the exceptional loans of vestments from the Vatican; upstairs are gowns fit for angels in heaven (by Lanvin, Thierry Mugler, Rodarte) or angels fallen to earth (such as slinky Versace sheaths garlanded with crosses). The scenography at the Met is willfully operatic — spotlights, choir music — which militates against serious thinking about fashion and religion, but up at the Cloisters, by far the strongest third of the show, you can commune more peacefully with an immaculate Balenciaga wedding gown or a divine Valentino gown embroidered with Cranach’s Adam and Eve. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘HISTORY REFUSED TO DIE: HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SOULS GROWN DEEP FOUNDATION GIFT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 23). This inspired foundation is dispersing around 1,200 works by black self-taught artists from the American South to museums across the country. The Met’s exhibition of 29 of the 57 pieces it received proposes an exciting broadening of postwar art. It is dominated by the dialogue between the rough-hewed relief paintings of Thornton Dial and the geometrically, chromatically brilliant quilts of the Gee’s Bend collective. But much else chimes in, including works by Purvis Young, Joe Minter and Lonnie Holley. (Roberta Smith) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘ALEJANDRO G. IÑÁRRITU: CARNE Y ARENA’ at 1611 Benning Road NE, Washington (through Aug. 31, 9 a.m.-9 p.m.). Perhaps the most technically accomplished endeavor yet in virtual reality — but closer in form to immersive live theater, created by a two-time Oscar winner — has arrived at a former church in Washington after outings in Cannes, Milan, Los Angeles and Mexico City. In “Carne y Arena” (“Flesh and Sand”), you explore the exhibition on your own with a motion-sensitive headset that transports you to Mexico’s border with the United States; brutal encounters with border guards interweave with surreal dream sequences, which you can perceive in three dimensions. The characters are computer renderings of the bodies of actual migrants; the landscapes are photographed by Mr. Iñárritu’s brilliant longtime cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. It remains too early to say whether virtual reality will reshape art institutions, but this is a rare achievement, and not only for its political urgency. Tickets will be released only on the website at 8 a.m. Eastern Time on the 1st and 15th of each month of the exhibition’s duration. (Farago) carneyarenadc.com ‘THE INCOMPLETE ARAKI’ at the Museum of Sex (through Aug. 31). It remains a bit of a tourist trap, but the for-profit Museum of Sex is making its most serious bid yet for artistic credibility with a two-floor exhibition of Japan’s most prominent and controversial photographer. Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or “the beauty of tight binding.” Given the venue, it’s natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki’s omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving “Sentimental Journey,” picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral. (Farago) 212-689-6337, museumofsex.com ‘BODYS ISEK KINGELEZ: CITY DREAMS’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through Jan. 1, 2019). The first comprehensive survey of the Congolese artist is a euphoric exhibition as utopian wonderland, featuring his fantasy architectural models and cities — works strong in color, eccentric in shape, loaded with enthralling details and futuristic aura. Mr. Kingelez (1948-2015) was convinced that the world had never seen a vision like his, and this beautifully designed show bears him out. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through Nov. 4). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘GEORGIA O’KEEFFE: VISIONS OF HAWAI‘I’ at the New York Botanical Garden (through Oct. 28). Finding out O’Keeffe had a Hawaiian period is kind of like finding out Brian Wilson had a desert period. But here it is: 17 eye-popping paradisal paintings, produced in a nine-week visit in 1939. The paintings, and their almost psychedelic palette, are as fleshlike and physical as O’Keeffe’s New Mexican work is stripped and metaphysical. The other star of the show, fittingly, is Hawaii, and the garden has mounted a living display of the subjects depicted in the artwork. As much as they might look like the products of an artist’s imagination, the plants and flowers in the Enid Haupt Conservatory are boastfully real. On Aloha Nights every other Saturday in July and August, the garden is staging a cultural complement of activities, including lei making, hula lessons and ukulele performances. (William L. Hamilton) 718-817-8700, nybg.org ‘RENOIR: FATHER AND SON/PAINTING AND CINEMA’ at Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia (through Sept. 3). Jean Renoir transformed the history of cinema with humanistic, precisely edited films like “The Grand Illusion,” and especially “The Rules of the Game” — considered one of the greatest films ever made, though it was a box-office flop on its release in 1939. Yet the critic he strove most to please was his father, the Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This terrific dad-and-lad exhibition, organized with Paris’s Musée d’Orsay, interweaves painting and cinema into a heartfelt survey of Jean Renoir’s career, and finds paternal influence in the pastoral romance of “A Day in the Country” or the bright landscapes of his 1959 color film “Picnic on the Grass.” The irony? It is Jean Renoir who now seems the more inventive artist, even if he was convinced that “I have always imitated my father.” (Farago) 215-278-7000, barnesfoundation.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘THE SENSES: DESIGN BEYOND VISION’ at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (through Oct. 28). There’s a serious, timely big idea at this exhibition: As social media, smartphones and virtual reality make us ever more “ocularcentric,” we have taken leave of our nonvisual senses — and need to get back in touch, literally. Thus “The Senses” features multisensory adventures such as a portable-speaker-size contraption that emits odors, with titles like “Surfside” and “Einstein,” in timed combinations; hand-painted scratch-and-sniff wallpaper (think Warhol’s patterned cows but with cherries — cherry-scented, naturally); and a device that projects ultrasonic waves to simulate the touch and feel of virtual objects. The show also presents commissions, videos, products and prototypes from more than 65 designers and teams, some of which address sensory disabilities like blindness and deafness, including Vibeat, which can be worn as a bracelet, brooch or necklace and translates music into vibrations. And if you bring the kids, they will likely bliss out stroking a wavy, fur-lined installation that makes music as you rub it. (Michael Kimmelman) 212-849-8400, cooperhewitt.org ‘CHAIM SOUTINE: FLESH’ at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 16). The Russian Jewish artist Chaim Soutine (1893-1943), who spent most of his life in Paris, is best known for bloody, ecstatic paintings of beef carcasses. But it wasn’t death that interested him — it was the immaterial life force of the material world. Along with an instructive lineup of naked fowl, silver herring and popeyed sardines, this indispensable tribute to the transcendent but still undervalued painter centers on a stupendous 1925 “Carcass of Beef,” glistening scarlet, streaked with orange fat and straddling a starry sky. (Will Heinrich) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS: STANLEY KUBRICK PHOTOGRAPHS’ at the Museum of the City of New York (through Oct. 28). This exhibition of the great director’s photography is essentially Kubrick before he became Kubrick. Starting in 1945, when he was 17 and living in the Bronx, he worked as a photographer for Look magazine, and the topics that he explored are chestnuts so old that they smell a little moldy: lovers embracing on a park bench as their neighbors gaze ostentatiously elsewhere, patients anxiously awaiting their doctors appointment, boxing hopefuls in the ring, celebrities at home, pampered dogs in the city. It probably helped that Kubrick was just a kid, so instead of inducing yawns, these magazine perennials struck him as novelties, and he in turn brought something fresh to them. Photographs that emphasize the mise-en-scène could be movie stills: a shouting circus executive who takes up the right side of the foreground while aerialists rehearse in the middle distance, a boy climbing to a roof with the city tenements surrounding him, a subway car filled with sleeping passengers. Looking at these pictures, you want to know what comes next. (Arthur Lubow) 212-534-1672, mcny.org ‘DAVID WOJNAROWICZ: HISTORY KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 30). This artist was there when we needed him politically 30-plus years ago. Now we need him again, and he’s back in this big, rich retrospective. Wojnarowicz (pronounced Voyna-ROH-vich), who died at 37 in 1992, was one of the most articulate art world voices raised against the corporate greed and government foot-dragging that contributed to the early AIDS crisis. But he was far from a one-issue artist. From the start, he took outsiderness itself, as defined by ethnicity, gender, economics and sexual preference, as his native turf. And from it he attacked all forms of exclusion through writing, performing and object making. In the show, we find him working at full force in all three disciplines, and the timing couldn’t be better. Not long before his AIDS-related death, during the culture wars era, he wrote, “I’m convinced I’m from another planet.” In 2018 America, he would have felt more than ever like a criminal migrant, an alien combatant. (Holland Cotter) 212-570-3600, whitney.org ‘WORLD ON THE HORIZON: SWAHILI ARTS ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN’ at the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington (through Sept. 3). The Swahili coast of East Africa is home to a crossroads culture. For millenniums, the port cities in Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique have been centers of long-distance trade and cultural exchange from multiple directions. To the west, they were anciently connected by caravan with Central Africa; to the east, by ship with India, China and Japan; to the north, with an Arab world that included Oman, Iran and Yemen; and to the south, via roundabout shipping routes with Europe and the Americas. This exhibition makes evident both the great beauty and the deep disturbance of those connections — East Africa was a nodal point on the international slave trade. (Cotter) 202-633-4600, africa.si.edu Last Chance ‘LIKE LIFE: SCULPTURE, COLOR AND THE BODY (1300 TO NOW)’ at the Met Breuer (through July 22). Taking a second run at the splashy theme-show extravaganza, the Met Breuer has greater success. This one is certainly more coherent since it centers entirely on the body and its role in art, science, religion and entertainment. It gathers together some 120 sculptures, dolls, artist’s dummies, effigies, crucifixes and automatons. Many are rarely lent and may not return anytime soon. (Smith) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘PAINTED IN MEXICO, 1700-1790: PINXIT MEXICI’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through July 22). Most religious art is visual theater, none more so than the great Roman Catholic Church paintings of 18th-century Mexico, which are at the center of this extraordinary exhibition, one of the high points of the season. Only within the past few decades has Spanish colonial art been awarded anything like center-stage status, and for reasons of unfamiliarity alone, the show is not to be missed. However, the real attraction is drama. You don’t have to be religious to respond to a painterly tour de force like “Apotheosis of the Eucharist” by Rodriguez Juarez, which, like an organ chord, opens the show. Commissioned for the convent of Corpus Christi in Mexico City, the work’s inspiration was as much political as devotional. (The convent was founded for Indian women of noble birth, at a time when “noble” and “Indian” were mutually exclusive concepts in much of Europe.) But what most matters about it now — and surely did when it was new — is its visionary imagery: the swirling clouds, the fainting saints, the angel-borne host that beams like a high-power flashlight. The show also features unforgettable portraits and cityscapes, though heaven remains the focal point. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘ADRIAN PIPER: A SYNTHESIS OF INTUITIONS, 1965-2016’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through July 22). A clarifying and complicating 50-year view of a major American artist’s career, this exhibition is also an image-altering event for MoMA itself. It makes the museum feel like a more life-engaged institution than the formally polished one we’re accustomed to. For the first time it has given over all of its sixth-floor special exhibition space to a single living female artist who is best known for her art about racism, and for good reason: It’s powerful work, brilliantly varied in form. She has also consistently used her own image in inventive, distanced, self-mocking ways, as in two well-known self-likenesses done several years apart: one, a pencil drawing titled “Self-Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features” (1981); the other, a crayon-enhanced photograph called “Self-Portrait as a Nice White Lady” (1995). In these images, as in all of her work, her aim is not to assert racial identity but to destabilize the very concept of it.

Carol Burnett sometimes daydreams of being young again and reliving her unparalleled career, she said at Sunday night’s Golden Globes, but then she stops short. “I realize how incredibly fortunate I was to be there at the right time, because what we did then couldn’t be done today,” she said. Burnett, 85, considered the “queen of comedy,” was accepting the inaugural Carol Burnett Award, an accolade that focuses on life achievement in television. And she took the moment to reflect on the opportunities that were available to her when she began a variety show called “The Carol Burnett Show” in 1967, which ran for “11 joy-filled years,” as she put it, and earned 25 Emmys. Burnett won five Golden Globes for the program, which drew about 30 million viewers a week. In her acceptance speech on Sunday, Burnett, who has been in the industry for seven decades, said she fell in love with movies as a young girl and then with television as a teenager. “What fascinated me was the way the stars on the screen could make people laugh or cry or sometimes both,” she said. “And I wished and I hoped that maybe, just maybe, some day, I could have the chance to do the same thing. Well, those childhood dreams came true.” But it was the message that those dreams may not pan out for someone today that was her focus. “The cost alone would be prohibitive,” she said, adding that other variety shows of the era, which ruled in the small screen, “could never see the light of day today because the networks just wouldn’t spend the money.” “They are not going to take a chance,” she went on. “It’s sad to say today’s audiences might never know what they are missing.” Even while making this more sobering point, though, Burnett did not pass on a punch line: “So here’s to reruns and YouTube!” Burnett said she was “gobsmacked” to not only be accepting the award but also to have it named after it her — “does this mean I get to accept it every year?” she joked. Burnett has collected numerous awards throughout her career including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a Kennedy Center Honor, the Mark Twain Prize for Humor and two Peabody Awards, one of which she accepted last year. “I’m just happy that our show happened when it did, and that I can look back and say once more I am so glad we had this time together,” she said in closing, using the same words — and signature gesture, an ear tug — that she closed her show with for all those years. The ear tug, which began as a secret greeting for her grandmother, has since become an iconic symbol, likely to forever represent the comedian.

By Jeffrey Rosen Dec. 7, 2018 JOHN MARSHALL The Man Who Made the Supreme Court By Richard Brookhiser Illustrated. 324 pp. Basic Books. $30. A Republican president and Congress declare war on the federal courts, eliminating newly created judgeships and canceling the Supreme Court session so the court can’t meet for more than a year. The chief justice, who considers the president a populist demagogue, fears further attacks on judicial independence. The president accuses his former vice president of treason, and the chief justice presides over the trial himself, upholding a subpoena that requires the president to turn over relevant evidence. And after the vice president is acquitted, the chief justice leads a court that represents the last bastion of resistance to mob rule, defending the sanctity of contracts against attacks from populist presidents and the states, upholding the power of Congress to regulate the national economy and forcing the president and state courts to acknowledge the supremacy of the Constitution. Image Chief Justice John Marshall’s battles with Thomas Jefferson and then Andrew Jackson, the two populist presidents in question, seem freshly relevant in our age of renewed anxieties about the future of the American republic. And, as Richard Brookhiser’s fine new biography, “John Marshall,” makes clear, the polarization of the age of Marshall matched (or even surpassed) our current battles over the composition of the Supreme Court. What differed in Marshall’s day was the great chief’s ability to win over Republican justices appointed by his archrival, Thomas Jefferson, and to join him in a series of unanimous opinions. By persuading the justices to set aside their partisan differences and to speak in one voice, Marshall established the court as an emblem of bipartisan legitimacy in a polarized time. As Brookhiser’s compact and balanced account makes clear, Marshall famously transformed the judicial branch into one fully equal to the president and Congress in stature and legitimacy. And he did so by declining to pick political fights he couldn’t win in the short term while declaring broad constitutional principles that would shore up the authority of the courts in the long term. This narrative, familiar to law students, has certainly taken on new relevance in the age of Donald Trump, when battles between the president, the chief justice and the courts are once again provoking talk of constitutional crisis. Brookhiser, a senior editor of National Review and the author of several books on the founding fathers, draws no present-day parallels, but it’s impossible not to think of our current vexations when reviewing 19th-century Republican efforts to impeach Federalist judges. The House did indeed impeach a Federalist justice, Samuel Chase, for being “highly arbitrary, oppressive and unjust,” but after Marshall testified for Chase, the Senate acquitted him. Congress then expanded the size of the Supreme Court from six justices to seven, to give Jefferson the chance to fill vacancies with Republicans. But Marshall won over the Republican justices by convincing them of the court’s institutional legitimacy. At a time of tribalism and polarization, culminating in threats by the states to nullify federal laws and secede from the Union, Marshall’s central idea, shared with his Federalist heroes George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, was that “we the people” of the United States as a whole are sovereign and united, as opposed to “we the people” of the individual states. “Our Constitution is not a compact” of states, Marshall wrote in an anonymous pamphlet defending his own opinion upholding Congress’s power to charter the Bank of the United States. “It is the act of a single party. It is the act of [the] people of the United States.” (Abraham Lincoln invoked the same argument in denying the South’s power to secede from the Union.) In an opinion echoing Washington’s Farewell Address, which had defined the United States as “one people,” Marshall wrote an eloquent paean to national unity: “In war, we are one people. In making peace, we are one people. In all commercial regulations, we are one and the same people.” Insisting that America was a republic rather than a direct democracy, he criticized Jefferson as a proto-Trumpian demagogue: “His great power … is chiefly acquired by professions of democracy. Every check on the wild impulse of the moment is [therefore] a check on his own power. … He looks, of course, with an ill will at an independent judiciary.” Jefferson’s allies, led by Senator Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky, responded by proposing to attack judicial independence by limiting the tenure of federal judges, preventing the federal courts from hearing cases, making judges removable by Congress, allowing the Senate to overturn the Supreme Court and increasing the size of the court to 10 justices. Although Johnson was a populist legend for having killed the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, these proposals went nowhere because of the bipartisan unity on the court that Marshall managed to inspire. Could the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts, who has embraced Marshall as his model, play a similar unifying role in defending the Constitution against populist threats to judicial independence today? That depends on his fellow justices. And although Brookhiser’s biography reminds us that American politics has always been polarized, today the polarization threatens to transform the deliberations of the court. The life of Marshall reminds us of the urgent importance of Roberts’s efforts to persuade his colleagues to unite around a shared commitment to defending the legitimacy of the court by rising above partisan politics. Jeffrey Rosen is the president and C.E.O. of the National Constitution Center and a law professor at George Washington University. His new book, “Conversations With RBG,” will be published next year.

arts A New Book About Mussolini Is Provoking a Debate Over His Legacy - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Books Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Books|A New Book About Mussolini Is Provoking a Debate Over His Legacy Supported by Books News A New Book About Mussolini Is Provoking a Debate Over His Legacy Image “In the Italian imagination, Mussolini remains a kind of totem, a figure of great charisma, a kind of perverse national father whom we have repressed,” said Antonio Scurati. “This book has brought him out of that repression.”CreditCreditRight: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images By Emma Johanningsmeier Dec. 8, 2018 ROME — Mussolini is invading Italy’s bookstores. For weeks, Antonio Scurati’s “M,” a doorstop of a novel about the rise of the dictator, Benito Mussolini, has sat on Italian best-seller lists. The book is set to be adapted into a major television series by Wildside, the same production company that is co-producing the HBO series based on Elena Ferrante’s “My Brilliant Friend.” And this fall, it conquered Frankfurt’s book fair, where HarperCollins snapped up the English rights to the book. “In the Italian imagination, Mussolini remains a kind of totem, a figure of great charisma, a kind of perverse national father whom we have repressed,” Scurati, 49, said in a recent interview. “This book has brought him out of that repression.” The unexpected popularity of “M” has also provoked a debate in Italy on Mussolini’s legacy. Scurati’s cheerleaders says his book is a much-needed reminder of the evils of fascism, particularly for young people. But critics say the resurrection and repackaging of Mussolini for the 21st century presents dangers in a time when right-wing governments are being elected around Europe, including in Italy. (For what it’s worth, Jonathan Burnham, president and publisher of the Harper division of HarperCollins said, “it is compelling reading for anyone interested in 20th century history.” He called the book “a timely investigation of how fascism can take root in a society.”) The book, clocking in at 839 pages, gives the impression of heft, as does its Spartan cover art of a black M against a white background. Although it has been marketed as a novel, it blurs the lines between novel and history textbook. It consists of short, detail-laden chapters interspersed with excerpts from historical telegrams, newspaper articles, letters and police reports. The chapters feature an omniscient narrator, but focus largely on the perspectives of Mussolini and his collaborators. All direct quotes in the book are drawn from historical sources, and Scurati said most of the novelistic reimagining of characters’ inner thoughts is based on such sources as well. He spent several years reading about Mussolini in preparation to write “M,” and has described it as a novel in which “nothing is invented.” Some critics worry that the neutrality of Scurati’s narrative, which has been marketed as the first novel to tell the story of fascism “without any political or ideological filter,” could reintroduce Mussolini not as a historical monster, but as a sympathetic protagonist. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar of fascism at New York University, described it as “a symptom” of the rehabilitation of Mussolini. “The history of fascism is a history of dictatorship, of leader-worship,” she said. “This book is part of this phenomenon that’s resurrecting the cult of the leader.” A self-described anti-fascist, Scurati knew he was walking a fine ideological line with his book, which aims to capture the fascination Mussolini exerted over Italians without falling prey to it. But the way he sees it, his book is an anti-fascist history lesson disguised as a novel. “If fascism was evil, if it brought evil into Italy and Europe, that should come out naturally in the narration,” he said. Image Mussolini is still “at the heart of the Italian conscience,” said Antonio Scurati, who said the idea for this book came to him while watching famous video footage of Mussolini giving speeches.CreditFox Photos/Getty Images The novel opens on a demoralized postwar Italy in 1919 and chronicles the fascists’ improbable rise to power. It describes the midnight assassinations of socialist leaders and the kidnapping and murder of Giacomo Matteotti, the early fascists’ most vocal opponent, but also intimate episodes like Mussolini’s concern over his sick child. It culminates in Mussolini’s Jan. 3, 1925 speech in Parliament, which historians consider the inauguration of his authoritarian regime. Scurati said he had the idea for this book about five years ago, while doing research for his novel, “The Best Time of Our Life,” about the anti-fascist Leone Ginzburg and watching famous video footage of Mussolini giving speeches from balconies. He said Italians had seen these clips “too many times, so many times we don’t really see them anymore.” “I thought at a certain point: This person is still, in a certain sense, at the heart of the Italian conscience,” recalled Scurati, who teaches literature and creative writing at IULM University in Milan. In Italy, the birthplace of fascism, Mussolini has never carried the same stigma as Hitler in Germany. The dictator still known as “Il Duce” enjoyed wide public support during his two-decade rule, despite his persecution of anti-fascists and Jews. Some in Italy today are willing to overlook those things for the perceived social stability of the fascist era. In the collective memory, “Italy always came out as the lesser evil with respect to Nazi Germany,” Ben-Ghiat said. “Because of that, Italians were able to say, ‘Well, we weren’t so bad. We weren’t the architects of the Holocaust.’” Today, Mussolini is less taboo than ever. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and head of its leading political party, sometimes quotes the fascist dictator. Meanwhile, Italian neo-fascist groups, which experts say are attracting many young people, hold frequent marches in cities throughout Italy. In February, a dark comedy called “I’m Back” depicted Mussolini returning to life as a TV and YouTube sensation. (It was an adaptation of the German film, “Look Who’s Back,” which was based on a satirical novel in which Hitler reappears.) Mussolini’s villa near Rimini in eastern Italy has become a popular wedding venue, while his tomb at Predappio attracts a steady stream of visitors. Scurati said he has been bombarded with letters from young readers enthused about a book they say has engaged them more than history classes at school. He is planning a trilogy that will end with Mussolini’s death in 1945. “Young people don’t come from the culture of fascism, or from that of anti-fascism. They’re a blank slate,” said Antonio Tricomi, a comparative literature professor at Italy’s University of Urbino who also teaches high school. He struggles to talk to his younger students about fascism, he said, because to them the fascist era might as well be “the Middle Ages.” But Tricomi is not so optimistic about the novel. “It wouldn’t surprise me if a good portion of the readers of this book bought it not because they share the author’s anti-fascist sentiments,” he said, “but because they like Mussolini.” Follow Emma Johanningsmeier on Twitter: @emma_jmeier.

Image David Wojnarowicz’s “Untitled (Face in Dirt),” from 1991, shows the artist sinking into the earth (or is he rising, Lazarus-like, from it?) in Death Valley. It is part of “David Wojnarowicz: History Keeps Me Awake at Night,” an exhibition opening Friday at the Whitney Museum of American Art.CreditCreditPrivate Collection David Wojnarowicz: History Keeps Me Awake at Night NYT Critic's Pick By Holland Cotter July 12, 2018 Like an irate guardian angel, the American artist David Wojnarowicz was there when we needed him politically 30-plus years ago. Now we need him again, and he’s back in a big, rich retrospective, “David Wojnarowicz: History Keeps Me Awake at Night,” at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Wojnarowicz (pronounced voyna-ROH-vitch),who died at 37 in 1992, was one of the most articulate art world voices raised against the corporate greed and government foot-dragging that contributed immeasurably to the global spread of AIDS. Yet he was far from a one-issue artist. Image Wojnarowicz’s “Untitled (Time and Money),” from his Ant Series, 1988-–89.CreditSecond Ward Foundation From the start, he took outsiderness itself, as defined by ethnicity, gender, economics and sexual orientation, as his true native turf. And from it he attacked — through writing, performing and object-making — all forms of exclusion and oppression. Not long before his AIDS-related death, he wrote, “I’m convinced I’m from another planet.” In 2018 America, he would have felt more than ever like a criminal migrant, an alien combatant. Alienation was the driving theme of the life story he told, repeatedly and often, a tale romantically massaged but based in fact. He was born in Red Bank, N.J. in 1954. His father, a merchant marine, was an abusive alcoholic. After his parents divorced, Wojnarowicz lived in foster homes and went to Catholic school. A shy child, he immersed himself in suburban nature. Already attuned to the vulnerability of innocence, he adopted stray animals as pets. By his teens he was having sex with men in exchange for cash, which became a means of support after a move to Manhattan. Although he barely squeaked by in high school, he was deep into self-education. Reading Jack Kerouac, Jean Genet and the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, he bypassed the Aquarian 1960s, and went, via Beat culture, straight to the anti-authoritarian outrage of punk. For several years, he identified as a poet — in my view, he was never not one — and then his focus changed and broadened. By 1979, he was in the East Village. He collaborated with friends on a band called 3 Teens Kill 4 (they made music with toy instruments and tape recordings), and started cruising the derelict shipping piers — the so-called gay “sex piers” — along the Hudson River, some near where the Whitney now stands. He shifted from poetry to art, operating outside, and sometimes in pointed opposition to, a traditional art world context. Uninvited, he stenciled images of fighter planes and falling figures on SoHo walls. He painted murals on the West Side piers. For his early gallery-ready work, he photographed three male friends wearing a cutout mask of Rimbaud’s face in different spots around the city. Image A work from the artist’s series “Arthur Rimbaud in New York,” 1978-–79. Wojnarowicz was deep into self-education, reading Jack Kerouac, Jean Genet and the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud.CreditPrivate Collection A set of “Arthur Rimbaud in New York” photographs, along with the original paper mask, opens this show, organized by two Whitney curators, David Breslin, the director of the museum’s collection, and David Kiehl, a curator emeritus. The image of Rimbaud as a loner bad boy — shooting up, masturbating, prowling Times Square — embodied Wojnarowicz’s early view of what an artist should be: a guerrilla infiltrator, disrupter of what he called the “pre-invented world” that we’re all told is normal, a world of fake borders, gated hierarchies and controlling insider laws. Image “History Keeps Me Awake at Night (For Rilo Chmielorz),” from 1986, gives the exhibition its title.CreditPrivate Collection Despite his anarchistic impulses, Wojnarowicz was a methodical worker, a planner. The Rimbaud series was carefully developed through notebook drawings, examples of which are on view. Self-taught, he painted the way certain writers write, with deliberation rather than grace, putting down one word, one idea, one image at a time, wedging and stitching them into a dense visual weave. By the mid-1980s, he had refined this practice and was ready to expand the scope of his art from local applications (posters advertising his band) to more ambitious ends. A vital catalyst for change was the photographer Peter Hujar (1934-1987). They met in 1980, were briefly lovers, and Hujar soon assumed the role of mentor, encouraging the younger artist to stretch himself, which he did. Although it’s sometimes said that Wojnarowicz’s work turned political only after he received an H.I.V.-positive diagnosis in 1988, the show reveals otherwise. A salon-like central gallery is lined with large-scale pictures from the mid-1980s that are basically the equivalent of the history paintings produced by Nicolas Poussin and Thomas Cole, big-thinking panoramas that addressed contemporary politics in a classical language of mythology and landscape. Image “Earth,” from 1987, is among the artist’s quartet of paintings of the four elements. They each depict an ecological Armageddon, though there’s much more going on as well.CreditThe Museum of Modern Art, New York Image “Fire,” 1987.CreditThe Museum of Modern Art, New York Image “Wind (for Peter Hujar),” 1987, with a panorama of charred earth, a blue sky, an open window and a floating bird’s wing.CreditThe Second Ward Foundation True, Wojnarowicz’s formal means — stenciling, spray painting, collaging — are anti-academic. But his fact-and-fantasy images of existential violence and degradation, past and present, are in an old allegorical mode. With its allover collage of rifle targets, national flags and United States currency, the 1986 painting that gives the show its title could easily be re-dated to 2018. So could the quartet of 1987 paintings named for the four elements: Earth, Water, Wind and Fire. Each depicts an ecological Armageddon, though there are other things going on too. The picture called “Water” is set in an oceanic version of outer space, with darting sperm for stars and a mother ship, seen in cutaway view, packed with visions of fecundity and sexual warmth. And “Wind (for Peter Hujar)” has a sense of airiness and release that is unusual for this artist. Above a chunk of charred earth, liberatory images rise: a blue sky, an open window and a floating bird’s wing. Hujar died of AIDS-related illness in 1987. Wojnarowicz was with him at the end, and in a radically memorializing gesture, took on-the-spot photographs of his friend’s corpse: head, hands, feet. Some of these images are in the show as framed prints. Others are incorporated into a text painting begun the following year. In it, Hujar’s hands are dimly visible, like ghosts, behind a curtain of words. Breath-catching in their ferocity, they read in part: Image “Untitled,” 1988. Wojnarowicz was with his dear friend and mentor, Peter Hujar, when he died in 1987. In a radically memorializing gesture, he took on-the-spot photographs of his friend’s corpse: head, hands, feet.CreditEstate of David Wojnarowicz and P.P.O.W. Gallery, New York “I say there’s certain politicians that had better increase their security forces and there’s religious leaders and health care officials that had better get bigger dogs and higher fences and more complex security alarms for their homes, and queer-bashers better start doing their work from inside howitzer tanks because the thin line between the inside and the outside is beginning to erode and at the moment I’m a thirty seven foot tall one thousand one hundred and seventy-two pound man inside this six foot frame and all I can feel is the pressure all I can feel is the pressure and the need for release.” In this piece, and others that followed, Wojnarowicz unabashedly turned, as he said, “the private into something public.” He collapsed political, cultural and personal history in a way that he hadn’t before. He took his outsider citizenship as a subject and weaponized it. The move was strategically effective:It got a lot of attention, including a barrage of right-wing attacks that have persisted into the near-present. Image Wojnarowicz incorporated images of his friend’s corpse into the text painting “Untitled (Hujar Dead),” from 1988-–89.CreditWhitney Museum of American Art, New York When, in 2010, and in a mangled form, his unfinished film “A Fire in My Belly” (1986-87) was included in a group show of queer art at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, both the Catholic League and members of Congress declared it blasphemous and demanded its removal. The museum complied. The piece is in the Whitney retrospective. It’s a harsh artifact, with conceptual blind spots. Shot primarily in Mexico, it makes Mexican culture look freakish and violent in a way one might have hoped this artist would have resisted. (His inclusion of cartoonish images of pre-Columbian sculpture in paintings feels similarly misjudged.) At the same time, it’s the work of an artist deeply invested in dealing with mortality and spirituality, huge subjects rarely, and usually only obliquely, addressed in American contemporary art. Whether you trace his interest to residual Roman Catholicism or to the last-rites urgencies of the AIDS years, it’s real, and right there in the work. In 1990, two years after Wojnarowicz tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS, he made what he knew would be a final trip out of New York. He traveled to the American Southwest with the photographer Marion Scemama. On a drive through Death Valley, he asked her to make his portrait. For the shoot, he dug a hole in the ground and buried himself in dirt so that only part of his face was visible. The picture, which is famous, comes at the end of the exhibition. Does it show the artist sinking into the earth? Or rising, Lazarus-like, from it? For sure, his profile is high in New York this summer. In addition to this retrospective, the first of its size since 1999, there’s an exhibition of related archival material, “The Unflinching Eye: The Symbols of David Wojnarowicz,” at the Mamdouha Bobst Gallery at New York University. And P.P.O.W. Gallery in Chelsea, which has exhibited the artist since the 1980s, has a show called “Soon All This Will Be Picturesque Ruins: The Installations of David Wojnarowicz,” featuring a genre of work not included at the Whitney. Image “Untitled (One day this kid...),” 1990.CreditThe Estate of David Wojnarowicz and P.P.O.W Gallery, New York, NY, via Whitney Museum of American Art, New York In his lifetime, Wojnarowicz became a star, though an unconventional one, unsmooth, unpredictable, unstylish even, with his clotted paint, uncouth symbols, and jabbing ideas and words. (One gallery in the Whitney is devoted entirely to the artist reading from his incendiary writings which may, in the end, prove to be his most important body of work.) There’s little about his art I would call sublime, yet I think of him as angelic. I think of him as being something like the Angel of History, as imagined by the philosopher Walter Benjamin, an omniscient being who looks back to the human disasters of the past and sees them repeating themselves in the present and future, which is exactly what’s happening in this country right now. Who would want to stick around to watch this dispiriting spectacle? A rightly and righteously angry angel might. And the Angel of History has no choice. The winds of change, constant and strong, force his wings open but won’t let him fly. It’s his job, which is an artist’s job, to stay. So forward, with purpose and something like love, he goes. Correction:  An earlier version of this review misstated, in one instance, the year when David Wojnarowicz received an H.I.V.-positive diagnosis. As correctly noted elsewhere in the review, it was 1988, not 1990.

It turned out — at least this year — the diversity wasn’t just in the nominees, but also in the winners selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Several performers of color won in some of the most prestigious categories, including the night’s best actor in a movie drama, the Egyptian-American star Rami Malek. And the diversity extended to the stories being told. Best animated movie went to “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” in which a version of the superhero is an Afro-Latino teenager. (The directing team behind the movie included an African-American filmmaker, Peter Ramsey.) Best comedy went to “Green Book,” about the relationship between an African-American pianist and his Italian-American driver. One winner, Darren Criss, spoke onstage about the issue, noting, “This has been a marvelous year for representation in Hollywood, and I am so enormously proud to be a teeny, tiny part of that as the son of a firecracker Filipino woman from Cebu that dreamed of coming to this country and getting to be invited to cool parties like this.” Video The show’s co-host Sandra Oh set the tone of the night early with an emotional speech about diversity in Hollywood.

Although Christmas is over, it’s hard to wean yourself from holiday movies. Now that Valentine’s Day is approaching, a Christmas-themed film about love might help you get ready for February’s celebration. With a star-studded cast — Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Keira Knightley, among others — the film follows several intertwining love stories, including that of a prime minister who falls for a young staffer, and one about a marriage on the brink and plagued by infidelity. Despite a few questionable subplots involving a young woman and a much older man in a position of power, which prompted the critic A. O. Scott to label the movie’s portrayal of love “shallow and dishonest” in The New York Times, the feature remains a cult classic and even received an unorthodox 15-minute sequel nearly 15 years later. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (2004) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. In this film, based on H. G. Bissinger’s 1990 nonfiction book, the director Peter Berg brings the small town of Odessa, Tex., where football reigns, to the screen. Here, the game takes precedence over everything, rivaling religion. Inspired by the Permian High Panthers’ 1988 season, the movie offers glimpses into the personal lives of the boys tasked with upholding their town’s honor, like the star quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), who is the victim of an abusive father (Tim McGraw). The players, as well as their coach (Billy Bob Thornton), must learn to navigate the pressures of being hometown heroes. Berg went on to create a television series of the same title, writing and directing its pilot episode.

arts For AT&T, Balancing Change and Preservation Under the Same Broken Pediment - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Art & Design Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Art & Design|For AT&T, Balancing Change and Preservation Under the Same Broken Pediment Supported by Critic’s Notebook For AT&T, Balancing Change and Preservation Under the Same Broken Pediment Image Rendering of the new revision to 550 Madison Avenue from Snohetta, which conserves Philip Johnson and John Burgee’s original pink granite facade and rose window and replaces the 90s-era windows.CreditCreditLMNB and Snøhetta By Michael Kimmelman Dec. 5, 2018 Sometimes the city works. There was a plan, which provoked protests. The Landmarks Commission, with unusual readiness, swooped in. The new plan is better. The tale argues for the whole messy, infuriating way New York occasionally stumbles toward progress. Tuesday night, in a Manhattan high school library, before a subcommittee of Community Board 5 and a small audience, the architects and developers of what used to be called the AT&T building — freshly minted as an official city landmark — presented their revised proposal to turn a historic, now vacant skyscraper into a Class A 21st-century office tower. This time the idea no longer involves stripping away the base of the building’s pink granite facade, the proposal that incited the Landmarks Commission earlier in the year. This time, less is more. And credit to those who stood up for saving an architectural lightning rod. A year ago, you may recall, the architecture firm Snohetta unveiled its initial plan to reincarnate the 37-story, 647-foot-high building with the Chippendale crown on Madison Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets, which Philip Johnson completed in 1984 with his partner, John Burgee, for AT&T. Conceived to convey permanence, the signature building opened in the midst of the telephone company’s breakup. Sony took the place over by the early 1990s. Lately, it had fallen vacant, a relic of an age when giant businesses commissioned whole skyscrapers for themselves. The development team, led by the Olayan Group, which acquired the site in 2016 for $1.4 billion, hired Snohetta to do the makeover. Image Snohetta’s original renovation proposal stripped away the base of the original facade for a fluted glass scrim.CreditDBOX and Snøhetta Snohetta’s big move in the first go around, visually speaking, was swapping out the lower portion of the building’s masonry facade for a diaphanous curtain wall. With its Apple store vibe, the fluted glass scrim exposed the building’s supporting steel structure and allowed light into a grand but gloomy second-floor sky lobby. It was a gambit that brought to mind Snohetta’s popular expansion of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Designed in the mid-1990s by Mario Botta, the museum’s masonry exterior always conveyed something of the air of a mausoleum, closing the building off from what was still a blighted part of the city. There, as well, Snohetta’s task was to update a divisive but potent project and civic symbol from the Postmodern era. In the case of AT&T, even Johnson conceded, as long ago as 1994, that the building had problems. Talking about the public loggias and rear arcade, he acknowledged “the area at the base wasn’t used and became cold and unfriendly.” But Snohetta’s initial scheme undid the formal logic of how the mass of the granite facade is poised on its monumental base of big-footed columns. Image Portrait of the architect Philip Johnson with a model of his design for the AT&T building from Life magazine in 1978.CreditTed Thai/The LIFE Picture Collection, via Getty Images The glass interrupted the tower’s pulled-taffy proportions, and spoiled what was even more distinctive than the broken pediment: the supersized Italianate portico, facing Madison Avenue, with its semicircular arches and big, quasi-ecclesiastical rose window. Years ago, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown famously described functional structures dressed up with signs or ornaments as “decorated sheds.” AT&T was one of Johnson’s decorated sheds, its brawny granite skin wrapped around a basically conventional steel frame. Snohetta’s glass wall, in effect, dressed the shed in drag. Picture LeBron James in uniform. Now picture LeBron James in uniform but wearing ballet slippers and an ankle-length, see-through plastic apron. The architects’ proposal, to its credit, also eradicated the clumsy 1990s-era ground-floor renovations by Gwathmey Siegel, which had made everything worse. Those renovations enclosed Johnson and Burgee’s open-air loggias with retail spaces. They made the pedestrian plaza in the back even drearier. Snohetta imagined a tree-filled public garden going back there, stripping away the hulking four-story annex that long served as a de facto indoctrination center for Sony customers, adding a grassy berm and leafy nooks with plenty of seating. But it was the change to the facade that roused picketers along Madison Avenue to tote “Hands Off My Johnson” signs and appeal to the Landmarks Commission. Protesters were doubly enraged after Olayan went ahead and demolished the lobby anyway, to add new elevators. That was an underhanded move. Even so, the anger of the protests came as a surprise to some of those for whom the armoire-shaped tower had long been an object of, if not disdain, ambivalence. As the critic Justin Davidson put it, Johnson’s design for AT&T “deliberately made it hard to distinguish between true grandeur and mock grandiloquence.” The building was at once a one-liner and one-of-a-kind. Detractors talked about the broken pediment on the city skyline as if it were the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from “Ghostbusters,” another mid-80s confectionary menace. Image The building today, viewed from the southeast, with its enclosed pedestrian plaza at the rear and heavily mullioned store windows.CreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times Image A rendering from Snohetta shows proposed revisions to 550 Madison, including a reopened bay of the original loggia linked to a new open-air park, replacing the current enclosed pedestrian passageway. A slender, Y-shaped awning will cover the park.CreditLMNB and Snøhetta But suddenly, young architects and preservationists, in particular, saw its defacement not as a strategy for resuscitating a dead building but as yet another assault on an increasingly vulnerable and admirable era in 20th century architecture. That revisionism extended to the work of Brutalists like Paul Rudolph, whose concrete behemoths, publicly reviled, had also come to be seen afresh by a generation of designers and design lovers. I have always loved Rudolph’s works, despite their practical problems. I never loved the AT&T building, although it became part of the mental furniture of the skyline and then, incrementally, began to stand out by contrast with so many new glass towers. It had also become a fixture in classes about late 20th century architecture, a textbook example of Post-Modernism, parable of the star architect, catnip on Instagram. And its chutzpah provided a timely antidote to the polite, public-spirited, retro-modernism that is now architecture’s default mode. Love it or hate it, 550 Madison was the opposite of polite. So it was good news when officials designated the exterior of the tower a city landmark in July. Preservation shouldn’t be a popularity contest, after all. At the same time, buildings need to remain viable for the sake of their owners, occupants and neighborhood. The trick is balancing the two. On Tuesday evening, Nick Anderson, project manager from Snohetta, presented the firm’s new strategy to the community board members. It leaves Madison Avenue’s facade along with the north and south sides of the building completely intact — in total, 94 percent of the exterior, Mr. Anderson said, won’t be touched. What will go are Gwathmey Siegel’s ugly tinted bay windows, with their obtrusive, heavy mullions. They’re going to be replaced with clear glazing, discreetly recessed to give visual prominence to the building’s columns and the vertical voids between them. Image A view of the new park with its half-moon waterfall, dozens of trees and new seating.CreditMoare and Snøhetta In the back, seven new windows will be added to bring daylight into the sky lobby from the west. Another, tall, arched window will also be inserted between the new elevators in the lobby to open a vista straight from Madison Avenue through to the garden. There were grumblings on the community board about the lobby’s demolition and whether the transparency of the arched window betrayed the sepulchral spirit of the original building. It does, but in the end the subcommittee endorsed the window and moved on to the proposed garden. With the elimination of the annex, and the return of the rear bays of the loggias to their original open-air configurations, the garden will become a new public park the size of the Museum of Modern Art’s sculpture garden, an indisputable upgrade. A slender, Y-shaped canopy will replace the half-barrel glass vault and mess of catwalks that now obscure the sky. Seasonal plantings will be conceived around a series of “outdoor rooms,” Mr. Anderson explained, whose “Platonic geometries” of circles and half-moons allude to the arches and round window on the facade and to other works by Johnson. In 2002, The Times critic Herbert Muschamp reviewed the Westin Hotel on Eighth Avenue by Arquitectonica, the Miami-based firm, a blue and pink-orange glass building that many New Yorkers, quite rightly, found hideous. “The very embodiment of beauty’s evil twin,” Muschamp wrote. “Not being too hung up on beauty is what makes life here possible, even thrilling,” was Muschamp’s response. He embraced the building’s outsider taste. Johnson was the ultimate insider. That said, 550 Madison raises a similar point. The city’s beauty derives from its cacophony of tastes and cultures, its tolerance. We don’t have to find every building we preserve beautiful. But we do need an occasional building like 550 Madison to remind us of who we are.

She said she had to fight “the ivory tower doorkeepers who often overlook or dismiss the works of black women historians, especially those of us who teach at historically black universities and colleges.”CreditCreditVinetta Paige-McCullough By Katharine Q. Seelye Jan. 4, 2019 Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, a historian who helped bring to light the long-suppressed role of black women in the women’s suffrage movement, died on Dec. 25 at her home in Columbia, Md. She was 77. Her daughter, Jeanna Penn, confirmed the death. The cause had not yet been determined, she said. Dr. Terborg-Penn, a professor of history at Morgan State University in Baltimore for more than three decades, was the author of seven books, most notably, “African American Women in the Struggle for the Vote, 1850-1920” (1998). It was one of the first book-length examinations of black women in the suffrage movement, and it challenged the existing narrative that was dominated, and framed, by white activists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Dr. Terborg-Penn’s book was a counterweight to “History of Women’s Suffrage,” a six-volume work, begun in 1881, that was edited by Anthony, Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage. That opus more or less erased from the picture the many black women who Dr. Terborg-Penn said had attended suffrage meetings, organized suffrage clubs and promoted the cause. Stanton, moreover, had expressed racist views, especially when arguing that women should have the vote before black men. Dr. Terborg-Penn identified more than 120 black women, including Mary Church Terrell and Sarah Parker Remond, and described “hundreds of nameless black women” who had participated in the suffrage fight but whose activity had been little noted and their speeches seldom recorded. Black women, she said, were shunted aside in the history books because their goals had diverged from those of the white, mostly upper-middle-class women who had led the charge. White women wanted parity with white men, while black women, only just emerging from slavery, wanted to use the ballot box to fight the racial oppression that was engulfing the South. Image Dr. Terborg-Penn’s 1998 book was a counterweight to a six-volume 1887 history that had more or less erased from the picture the many black women who fought for the right to vote. The racial split became glaringly obvious in 1913, when the white organizers of a major suffragist parade in Washington ordered black participants to march in the rear. The 15th amendment, ratified in 1870, granted black men the right to vote, outraging some white women, who thought that they should have the vote before black men. As Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National Women Suffrage Association, said at the time, “Never before in the history of the world have men made former slaves the political masters of their former mistresses!” While the 19th Amendment, ratified in 1920, said that the right to vote could not be denied on the basis of sex, in practice this applied only to white women. Blacks of both sexes, especially in the South, were effectively barred from voting by poll taxes, literacy tests and other forms of intimidation, including lynching, until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Dr. Terborg-Penn was one of a handful of scholars delving into this history. In the predigital age, that meant reading old newspapers on microfiche, unearthing original manuscripts and the minutes of political meetings, and combing through collections at Howard University, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, part of the New York Public Library. “She committed the first decades of her career to the deep research that was required to pull back the curtain, dispel the myths and otherwise challenge the story about the history of women and the vote that had been, to an important degree, crafted by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton,” Martha S. Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said in a telephone interview. While bringing to life this neglected aspect of American history, Dr. Terborg-Penn and a few others also established a new field of study. “These are people who literally created the field of African-American women’s history, and Dr. Terborg-Penn’s writing on suffrage was a critical part of that,” Francille Rusan Wilson, national director of the Association of Black Women Historians, said in a phone interview. Dr. Terborg-Penn was a founder of the association in 1979 and its first national director. Image Suffragists marching along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington in 1913 drew an enormous crowd.

Buck, via Library of Congress In 2008, in a conference titled “Black Women in the Academy” in New Orleans, Dr. Terborg-Penn said it had not been easy to overcome the skepticism and inherent racism expressed by some of her own teachers and colleagues with regard to her work. She said she had to fight “the ivory tower doorkeepers who often overlook or dismiss the works of black women historians, especially those of us who teach at historically black universities and colleges,” of which Morgan State is one. “Nonetheless,” she added, “we have made a way when there was no way.” Rosalyn Marian Terborg was born on Oct. 22, 1941, in Brooklyn. Her father, Jacques Arnold Terborg, was a jazz guitarist who also worked as a skycap at New York airports. Her mother, Jeanne Knox (Van Horne) Terborg, did administrative work. The family moved from Brooklyn to Queens in 1951, and Rosalyn graduated from John Adams High School there in 1959. She earned her bachelor’s degree in history from Queens College in 1963. Her activism, fueled by her father, who believed strongly in civic engagement, blossomed in college. She led a protest when Queens College would not let Malcolm X speak on campus. On weekends, with a handful of other black students, she marched in front of an F. W. Woolworth & Co. store in Manhattan in solidarity with blacks who had staged a sit-in at an all-white Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., where they had been refused service. “We got the same response in New York City as in North Carolina,” Dr. Terborg-Penn recalled at a conference in 2016. “White America was not ready for this. We needed to stay in our place.” She went on to earn her master’s in history from George Washington University and her Ph.D. in history from Howard University in 1977. Notable Deaths 2018 A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 An early marriage while she was in Queens ended in divorce. In 1968 she married William Thomas Penn; they separated a decade later and were divorced in 1990. In addition to her daughter, Jeanna, she is survived by her brother, Jacques Arnold Terborg Jr., and a grandson. Dr. Terborg-Penn’s graduate years were highly productive. She won an award for an essay, “Discrimination Against Afro-American Women in the Women’s Movement.” She and Sharon Harley, a fellow graduate student, published “The Afro-American Woman: Struggles and Images.” And her dissertation, titled “Afro-Americans in the Struggle for Woman Suffrage,” became the blueprint for her groundbreaking book two decades later. She began her teaching career at Morgan State as an instructor in 1969 and retired as a professor of history in 2006. She continued to work with graduate students and retired fully from Morgan in 2009 with the title university professor emerita. Dr. Terborg-Penn also studied women in the African diaspora. As part of that work she explored her own family history in the Caribbean, South America and Europe, and helped organize the Association for the Study of the Worldwide African Diaspora. Shortly before her death, she attended a meeting of the Association of Black Women Historians, held in Los Angeles, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. “Generations of historians regard her as an important figure in their study and scholarship,” her daughter said in a phone interview. “They were so excited to see her.

arts Stalin’s Soaring Moscow Towers Sorely Need Body Work - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Europe Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Europe|Stalin’s Soaring Moscow Towers Sorely Need Body Work Supported by Moscow Dispatch Stalin’s Soaring Moscow Towers Sorely Need Body Work By Neil MacFarquhar Dec. 29, 2018 Image The Moscow State University building, at nearly 800 feet, is the biggest of the so-called “Stalin high-rises” that were built to symbolize the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany and which transformed Moscow’s skyline.CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York Times MOSCOW — Mikhail Posokhin still remembers the lip-smacking displays in Grocery Store No. 5 from his boyhood, when in 1955 his family moved into one of Moscow’s seven new, gothic skyscrapers. More cathedral than marketplace, the grocery boasted marble floors and pillars, high ceilings with elaborate chandeliers and stained glass windows. Fish circled inside a large aquarium, while brightly lit display cases presented rarities like caviar heaped in crystal bowls. Unlike other Moscow stores, milk, sausage and chocolate bars were never scarce. Muscovites came to gawk in droves, even if it was mostly the privileged elite — handed the high-rise apartments for free — who could afford to shop. “These complexes presented a new life never seen by people before,” said Mr. Posokhin, a prominent Moscow architect whose father designed the building. “They were supposed to express the victorious spirit and the grandeur of the era.” That was then. Grocery Store No. 5, in the Kudrinskaya Square tower, now sits dusty and abandoned, some of its broken windows replaced with plywood. Screens erected above the building’s entrance shield pedestrians from tumbling masonry. Up close, statues of muscular men and Madonna-like mothers look mottled. Most of the city’s so-called “Stalin high-rises” — both residential and government buildings — desperately need renovating. They are stuck in limbo, however, over who will foot the substantial bill. Since the residential apartments were privatized in the 1990s, the government considers the owners responsible. The residents, particularly the impoverished elderly who inherited apartments from the now deposed Soviet elite, believe that City Hall or the Kremlin should restore structures considered historical monuments. “In Russia, there is still no culture of owning real estate,” said Elizabeth Lihacheva, director of the Schusev State Museum of Architecture, noting that even people who spend $1 million for an apartment often don’t want to pay one kopeck toward cleaning its courtyard. Ideology inspired the construction of the Stalin high-rises, rechristened for tourists with the more palatable name of the Seven Sisters. When World War II ended, large swaths of Moscow lay in ruins. Stalin thought the city, marking its 800th anniversary, lacked the grandeur required of a triumphant capital.

The most luxurious buildings of the Soviet era, many of the seven towers are now crumbling but remain symbols of Moscow.CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Image The hulking Radisson Royal Hotel, known in Soviet times as the Hotel Ukraine, was the largest hotel in Europe when it opened with 1,000 rooms. Its post-Soviet owners spent some $300 million erasing its slightly seedy past to create a 535-room luxury hotel, but some relics endure, including a ceiling fresco in the lobby depicting a Ukrainian grain harvest.CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York Times “Stalin was basically building a Soviet Empire,” Mrs. Lihacheva said. “It needed to be expressed in architectural terms.” Prewar plans for a monstrosity called the Palace of the Soviets, topped by a statue of Lenin twice the height of the Statue of Liberty, were abandoned because the swampy ground would not support it. The idea was reconceived as eight buildings, a kind of expansive crown encircling the capital’s strategic points and echoing the Kremlin walls. Then, as now, the Kremlin’s denizens measured themselves in comparison to the United States. Stalin thought people would find Communism deficient if Moscow lacked skyscrapers. Yet simply aping American style would not do, either. “They go to America and they say ‘Ah, the buildings are so huge’,” the Soviet dictator said, according to a 2011 history of the buildings. “Let them come to Moscow and see that type of building. Let them say, ‘Ah!’” The government decree issued in 1947 to start construction ordered that the buildings look uniquely Russian. So the décor is Russian baroque, even if various American landmarks heavily influenced the architects, including the Wrigley Building and the Tribune Tower in Chicago, as well as the Woolworth and Municipal buildings in Lower Manhattan. Some people find the resulting confection magnificent, others eerie and intimidating. The heavy stone cladding and crenelations of their fortresslike exteriors would fit right into Gotham City. On a dark snowy night, with exterior lights casting deep shadows across their imposing facades, one almost expects the Batmobile to come roaring out of any one of them. In a city previously dominated by church bell towers, the buildings’ spectacular scale reshaped the skyline. They became symbols of Moscow and defined the modern face of the Soviet Union. Clones were constructed in various outposts of the empire, including Warsaw, Riga and Bucharest. After Stalin died in 1953, the new leader, Nikita Khrushchev, found the entire project ostentatious, so construction of the 8th building, just off Red Square, was canceled. The rest, costing what was at the time a staggering $500 million overall, were completed by 1957.

All students, along with various academic departments, were housed in the building’s 6,000 rooms until the 1970s.CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Each tower comes draped in its own lore. The Moscow State University building, for example, was the biggest of the lot and at nearly 800 feet, was Europe’s tallest building until 1990. Besides various academic departments, its 6,000 rooms housed all students until the 1970s, with beds, desks and bookcases meticulously designed for small spaces. Students describe an unfortunate side effect of decades without renovation — a sharp, chemical smell clings to the dorm and its residents — although this could not be verified as the university did not permit an American reporter to enter the building. “I could always tell by the smell if a student sitting next to me in an exam lived in the dormitory,” said Roman Yankovskiy, a young lawyer who nonetheless loved the building and spent the last three years compiling a book about it. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs tower originally had a flat top, and legend has it that Stalin, passing in his car, found that too American and ordered a Kremlin-like spire installed. Mrs. Lihacheva of the Architecture Museum said that the true story was Stalin only inquired about the flat top. It was the head of construction, fearing the ruthless dictator, who ordered a metal spire jammed onto the completed building. The federal government is paying for a gradual renovation of this building, due to be completed by 2026, with the massive hammer and sickle on the front to be preserved as a historical detail. The government buildings have fared better than the residential blocks. In the 1990s, for example, when factories bought scrap metal by the kilogram, thieves hacked the original bronze Art Deco handles off many apartments in the Krasnaya Vorota tower. The Kudrinskaya Square tower, known as the House of Aviators, housed numerous air defense officers and scientists. Irina V. Pozdeeva, 84, and her late husband inherited an apartment there 14 years ago from her father-in-law, a lieutenant general who had helped develop missiles. The 13-foot ceilings accommodate shelves for about 20,000 books. But the collective spirit of the place has ebbed, she said, with rich, often absentee owners buying up the 450 apartments. This is the building that Mr. Posokhin moved into as a boy. The architect recently designed a giant Art Deco building with a flat top as a tribute to the original vision of the Stalin high-rises.

The apartment’s 13-foot ceilings accommodate shelves for about 20,000 books.CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York Times But the Russian bank moving in demanded a spire — now sometimes illuminated at night with the colors of the Russian flag. “Our mistake was corrected,” Mr. Posokhin said with a wry laugh. Built near the Kremlin, the Kotelnicheskaya Embankment building is the only residential high-rise to have been renovated. The city called it “emergency” repair, but residents of other buildings grouse that it got special treatment because important functionaries still live in some of its 700 apartments, including a senior Kremlin apparatchik who reportedly bought almost an entire floor. The KGB, which supervised construction of the Embankment and University buildings, used prison laborers. Some left boards inside the walls painted with the names of their Gulags. One well-built prisoner was also the model for an exterior frieze. Each residential building was a self-contained Soviet Valhalla, with a grocery store, post office, movie theater and garage, unheard-of luxury at the time. They also included innovations for Russia like garbage chutes, which brought their own problems. Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a famous poet, wrote a lengthy ode to unwanted bedfellows crawling in through the chutes: The cockroaches are staging their attack. Admirals and ballerinas, The nuclear scientist and the poet, Burrow under bedclothes. Roach-refuge? Not to be had!

Tol; Claude Monet By Elizabeth A. Harris and Alexandra Stevenson Dec. 9, 2018 The van Gogh and the Monet are safely in storage in Switzerland. The Oscar that once belonged to Marlon Brando is in a federal warehouse in Texas. Those were easy enough to corral. But when the $250 million yacht was finally captured in Bali, the United States government couldn’t let it bob in the water unattended, so it had to pay for a crew. The $35 million Bombardier jet has been grounded, but it needed an engine test costing up to $25,000. And no one is quite sure what to do with the see-through grand piano now sitting in a supermodel’s Malibu home. It won’t fit through the door. All of the items, and many more, had been bought by a flamboyant Malaysian financier named Jho Low, who prosecutors say helped siphon billions of dollars from a Malaysian government investment fund, then went on a colossal spending spree. It is one of the largest international kleptocracy cases the United States has ever pursued. It is so expansive that just tracking down, retrieving and maintaining the loot has become a complex multinational operation in itself. Image Mr. Low bought the supermodel Miranda Kerr a see-through grand piano similar to this one.CreditPeter A. Tol Court documents and interviews describe a recovery effort that involves half a dozen federal agencies, a bevy of contractors and investigators in countries including Switzerland, Luxembourg and Malaysia. Its targets include more than a dozen properties in New York, California and London, including a $31 million condominium in the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, the Viceroy L’Ermitage Beverly Hills hotel and a $17.5 million mansion in Beverly Hills that came with a gold-tipped pyramid floating in a reflecting pool. The process has been slowed because of the pending criminal case, which itself is lagging because Mr. Low, 37, is a fugitive believed to be hiding in China. There are also thorny legal issues because Mr. Low and some of the other defendants have denied wrongdoing and are challenging the forfeitures. Several of the items are owned by trusts, and Mr. Low “does not consider it proper for any government to seize property belonging to the trusts or himself,” said Robin Rathmell, Mr. Low’s lawyer. The United States took the lead in the investigation because it has been cracking down on the flow of illegal money through the American financial system, and because until a few months ago, Malaysia’s own government was being run by the very people accused of ripping it off. Image Jho Low in 2014. He and others have been charged with stealing billions from a Malaysian investment fund.CreditDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images The fund at the center of the investigation, called the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund or 1MDB, was supposed to benefit ordinary Malaysians. It raised billions of dollars from banks and borrowed from investors, ostensibly to finance projects like a joint venture with a Saudi oil company and the purchase of power plants. But prosecutors say 1MDB became a “massive, brazen and blatant” money-laundering scheme, in which billions were diverted into the bank accounts of senior officials, including the former prime minister Najib Razak, his family and associates and Mr. Low. The scandal led to the ouster of Mr. Najib. It also has ensnarled Goldman Sachs, which helped 1MDB raise money; a Justice Department employee who pleaded guilty to helping Mr. Low funnel money into the United States; and Elliott Broidy, a top fund-raiser for President Trump who was paid to lobby the administration to stop the investigation. (Mr. Broidy is not accused of any crime.) Laundering the money, prosecutors say, involved a complex network of opaque bank accounts and shell companies registered in exotic locations like the British Virgin Islands. But the idea was simple: Use 1MDB as a vehicle to draw in big money. And then spend it. Some $200 million was used to buy artwork. There was a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth $27.3 million, said to have been given to Mr. Najib’s wife. (Her lawyers say that while she saw the necklace, which has gone missing, she never actually received it.) Image The Justice Department said more than $200 million was spent on artworks, including Monet’s “Saint-Georges Majeur,” now sitting in storage in Switzerland.CreditClaude Monet Tens of millions of dollars went toward financing Hollywood films including “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Daddy’s Home” through a production studio called Red Granite Pictures, which was owned by Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib’s stepson. Red Granite has settled with the government for $60 million without admitting wrongdoing. A quarter billion was spent on a custom-built mega-yacht with a movie theater, helicopter pad and enough space for dozens of crew members. Indonesian authorities said the boat’s transponder was turned off at times, making it difficult for the F.B.I. to track it, but the yacht, called the Equanimity, was finally seized in Bali this year. The United States then staffed it with a crew until it was turned over to Malaysia’s custody. Mr. Low, who had a self-proclaimed taste for the very finest things, also used some of the money to lavish gifts on celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and the Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, prosecutors say. In 2014, Mr. Low bought the clear-acrylic grand piano from Crystal Music Company in the Netherlands and had it delivered to Ms. Kerr in Malibu. Peter Tol, the company’s founder, declined to discuss the price but said that his custom pieces now cost from $170,000 to upward of $1 million. It has been a centerpiece of Ms. Kerr’s home. She has been photographed lounging on its lid in a Giorgio Armani gown and has been recorded tapping out a simple song called “The Flea Waltz.” Image Ms. Kerr has relinquished jewelry that Mr. Low gave her and has agreed to give up the piano — if the government even wants it back.CreditMarcy Swingle for The New York Times Mark Fabiani, a lawyer for Ms. Kerr, said she is happy to relinquish the piano. But it’s not clear that it is worth the effort to get it out. “If you move it, you might damage it, and then you have to restore it,” said Michael Case, the asset forfeiture coordinator for the United States Marshals Service in Manhattan, speaking generally about such operations. This extraction would be especially complicated. When Mr. Tol delivered the piano, he was horrified to learn it would be left on an outdoor deck, protected only by an overhang. “This was hurting my soul very much,” he said. “I strongly advised them to close that area.” Ms. Kerr followed his advice. But those new walls are a problem for the government, which believes it would have to do some demolition to get the piano out, according to two people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorized to speak publicly. Then a very expensive house would have to be repaired. So for now, the piano stays. Other tokens of Mr. Low’s esteem have been easier to retrieve. Ms. Kerr handed over a substantial amount of jewelry, including a 11.71-carat heart-shaped diamond and a pair of 11-carat diamond earrings. Image The government has to maintain the assets before they can be sold off. An engine test for a Bombardier jet like this one costs up to $25,000.CreditBombardier Mr. DiCaprio, too, has relinquished his gifts, including Picasso’s “Nature Morte au Crâne de Taureau” (Still Life With Bull’s Head) and a collage called “Redman One” by Jean-Michel Basquiat, both of which he had stored in Switzerland. He also gave up Brando’s 1954 Oscar for “On the Waterfront.” According to “Billion Dollar Whale,” a book about Mr. Low by two Wall Street Journal reporters, the statue had disappeared from Mr. Brando’s Hollywood home; Mr. Low bought it for $600,000 from a film memorabilia dealer. Unfortunately for the government, when any post-1950 Oscar is put up for sale, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has the right to buy it for $1, a spokeswoman for the academy said. In Malaysia itself, the haul has been immense. Just days after Mr. Najib was voted out, the police raided six residences connected to him. They seized 35 bags of cash in 26 currencies, and it took 22 officers three days to determine their full value — about $30 million. There were bags of gold (25), Hermes handbags (272) and watches (423). Everything is being stored in Kuala Lumpur at the Malaysian central bank. “The numbers were just too huge for us to do the accounting on the premises,” said Amar Singh, who led the asset seizures for the Royal Malaysian Police. Mr. Najib has denied wrongdoing, and Farhan Shafee, a member of his legal team, said, “As far as we can see and as far as the documents provided show, the assets that were seized have nothing to do with the charges that have been brought.” As for Mr. Tol, the piano maker, he said he felt terrible if he had unwittingly accepted money “destined for the normal people of Malaysia.” “I don’t like it,” he said. “It is not my way of life.” Vickey Barron, a real estate broker who sold a $51 million penthouse in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood to another man later implicated in the 1MDB case, Khadem al-Qubaisi, recalled the transaction as a blur. (Mr. al-Qubaisi has been jailed in Abu Dhabi since 2016, making it difficult to defend himself, his lawyer said.) An entourage of about half a dozen people had zipped through a tour of the apartment, and within a day, a representative called to say they would take it. She called it one of the strangest deals she’d ever done. “I take longer to buy a pair of sneakers,” she said, “than he took to buy the apartment.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting from Bangkok.

In recent years, the show has come under fire for its seeming systematic marginalization of women. And its treatment of hip-hop has led some of the genre’s big stars to effectively boycott the awards, or at minimum, shrug off their relevance. So the nominations for the 61st annual awards, which were released Friday, were destined to be heavily scrutinized. Hip-hop was well represented; Kendrick Lamar and Drake were the most nominated artists. Women were well represented, dominating each of the big four general field categories — record of the year, song of the year, album of the year and best new artist. But there were unexpected quirks as well, like the nominations showered on the folk singer Brandi Carlile and the surprising one nod for Taylor Swift’s “Reputation.” Once the nominations were revealed, the The New York Times pop music staff gathered to read them together in real time and offer reactions.

One reviewer said Mr. Barber’s Trujillo seemed “scarily on the edge of madness.” The other actors, from left, are Pietro Gonzalez, Pedro de Llano and Rene Sanchez.CreditCreditRuby Washington/The New York Times By Neil Genzlinger Dec. 25, 2018 Ricardo Barber, a stage actor who left Cuba after spending time in a forced-labor camp during Fidel Castro’s rule and became a core member of the Spanish-language troupe Repertorio Español in New York, died on Dec. 17 in Manhattan. He was 81. The company announced his death. No cause was given. Mr. Barber was establishing himself as an actor in Havana when Castro came to power in 1959 in a Communist revolution that was hostile to many things, including homosexuality. Mr. Barber was gay, and in the late 1960s he was placed in one of Castro’s “military units to aid production,” the agricultural labor camps known by the Spanish acronym UMAP, which were, as The New York Times put it in 1974, “for petty criminals, homosexuals, ‘pre-delinquents’ and other ‘potential dissenters’ — people who were not guilty of any wrongdoing, but had been sent to the camps because of their ‘attitude.’ ” The camps were abolished after a few years, but the experience changed Mr. Barber’s feelings toward his country. “I wasn’t the same,” he told The Times in 1998, when he and other Repertorio actors made an emotional return trip to Cuba. “I no longer believed in the revolution, and I began to see the bad in everything.” He left in the mid-1970s, going first to Spain and then, about four years later, settling in New York, where he soon joined Repertorio Español. He was a member of the company from 1981 until his retirement in 2014. Among the numerous productions in which he appeared was “The Feast of the Goat,” an adaptation of Mario Vargas Llosa’s novel about the Dominican despot Rafael Trujillo. Mr. Barber played Trujillo. Image Mr. Barber with Graciela Lecube in “Te Juro Juana, Que Tengo Ganas,” one of his earliest American appearances.CreditRepertorio Español “As the dictator, Mr. Barber, often in military regalia and crowned by a white-plumed hat, seems both scarily on the edge of madness and yet capable of consciously using that part of himself as a mode of intimidation,” Bruce Weber wrote when he reviewed the production for The Times in 2003. “His eyes blaze in his drawn face, both the swelling self-importance and the challenge to all usurpers evident in every pose.” But — evidence of the versatility for which he was known — Mr. Barber also performed a second role in that production, which was directed by Jorge Ali Triana: a Trujillo adviser who had fallen out of favor. “By creating the dual role for Mr. Barber,” Mr. Weber wrote, “Mr. Triana is making the point that Trujillo’s control of the nation depended on gutless collaborators, and in his performance Mr. Barber makes vivid the wages of despotism, for a nation and for a man.” Ricardo Fernando Barber was born on June 5, 1937, in Placetas, Cuba. His father, José, was a school principal, and his mother, Maria del Carmen Rodriguez, was a homemaker. When Ricardo was about 6 years old, the family moved to Cojimar, near Havana. He studied optometry and theater arts at Havana University, graduating in 1961. He was part of several theater groups, including Teatro Estudio, led by Raquel and Vicente Revuelta, a sister and brother who were part of an illustrious Cuban theatrical family. His assignment to the camp led colleagues to protest on his behalf. One fellow actor, Ana Molinet, is said to have waged a personal campaign seeking his release that included slipping a note to Castro.

Mr. Barber’s performance was praised as “a fine piece of comic torment.”CreditRepertorio Español Luis Mallo, a nephew, said one family story is that while in the camp, Mr. Barber formed a theater troupe and put on a play that was critical of the Castro regime. “While he was there!” Mr. Mallo said by email. “It shows his determination and his belief, I think, that art had a moral duty and should be used to create change when necessary. A bit idealistic perhaps, but nevertheless courageous and optimistic.” Once in the United States, Mr. Barber made a quick impression with Repertorio Español. “Ricardo Barber, as the ambitious and prim young teacher, is a slim, sallow and hilarious performer whose outrageous and nimble mugging is one of the show’s highlights,” Richard F. Shepard wrote in The Times in 1982, reviewing “Te Juro Juana, Que Tengo Ganas” (“I Swear to You, Juana, I Want to …”), one of his first American appearances. Another opportunity to display his comedic abilities came in the late 1980s, when the company staged Eduardo Machado’s “Revoltillo” (“Broken Eggs”), about a Cuban-American family. “Ricardo Barber’s Osvaldo is a fine piece of comic torment,” D. J. R. Bruckner wrote in his review in The Times. “Mr. Barber’s sense of timing, along with an ability to express emotions with only his eyes and mouth, lets Osvaldo turn barbs from his father, mother-in-law, ex-wife and children back on them. In a play that is a battle of one-liners, this Osvaldo has effective silent defense weapons.” It was this play that the company took to Cuba in 1998, an entourage that included more than half a dozen Cuban-American actors and toured four cities. Mr. Barber is survived by two sisters, Rosa Barber and Violeta Barber.

But now, once those holiday playlists stop streaming, it becomes just another slow week on the charts. The rapper 21 Savage has the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s album chart for a second time with “I Am > I Was,” with the equivalent of about 65,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. That includes 84 million streams and a little more than 3,000 copies sold as a full album. Overall, the album lost 51 percent of its momentum from its opening week. With no major new releases last week, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie holds at No. 2 with “Hoodie SZN,” while most of the rest of the Top 10 is also filled with recent rap hits: Meek Mill’s “Championships” is No. 3, Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 4, and the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” soundtrack — featuring Post Malone, Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD and others — is No. 5. Michael Bublé’s “Christmas,” which had reached as high as No. 3 this season, fell to No. 148 with a 91 percent decline in streams, while Mariah Carey’s “Merry Christmas” fell 173 spots to No. 181. In total, songs from the Top 200 albums racked up 2.6 billion streams last week, down from 3.4 billion the week before.

arts A Timely Dystopian Thriller With Sexual Assault and Political Corruption at Its Core - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Book Review Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Book Review|A Timely Dystopian Thriller With Sexual Assault and Political Corruption at Its Core Supported by Fiction A Timely Dystopian Thriller With Sexual Assault and Political Corruption at Its Core Image Idra NoveyCreditCreditSylvie Rosokoff Buy Book ▾ Amazon Local Booksellers Barnes and Noble When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. By Helene Stapinski Dec. 7, 2018 THOSE WHO KNEW By Idra Novey 248 pp. Viking. $26. Idra Novey’s timing is impeccable, though she probably wishes it weren’t — for the sake of the Union. Her second novel, “Those Who Knew,” features a popular politician who has a history of assaulting women, including one attack in which he clamps his hand down over the face of our protagonist, Lena, nearly suffocating her until she passes out. The book is a thriller of sorts, as Lena flashes back to that moment, haunted by the death of another young woman she’s sure the politician, a sociopathic senator named Victor, has murdered. He could kill again — thanks to Lena’s silence and the silence of others, including Victor’s homosexual playwright brother, Freddy. Freddy writes an experimental drama exposing Victor, which is interspersed in bits and pieces between the short chapters of the novel, but he locks it in a desk drawer. This is not so much a Whodunit as a When Will They Speak Up? “Those Who Knew” opens on an unnamed island 10 years after the fall of a murderous American-backed regime, and Victor has emerged as a young liberal savior, a leader from the Truth and Justice Party. But Victor is just as bad as, or worse than, his predecessors. Lena, a rebel whose family members were supporters of the old regime, thinks that if she blew the whistle on the beloved senator, no one would believe her. In addition to his assaults on women he claims to love, Victor is involved in a farm scandal, which leaves a lake of swine feces stinking up the countryside. It’s only a matter of time before someone smells the rot. Novey’s first book, the critically acclaimed “Ways to Disappear,” took place in Brazil and tackled similarly unpleasant subject matter — a kidnapping, a severed ear, a writer disappearing up a tree, a strained mother-daughter relationship and a hotel going up in flames. It had bite-size chapters as well, interspersed with faux dictionary definitions rather than the intermittent play scenes and diary entries here. But somehow there was a sense of magic to that last book, an optimism among the dark alleys and dysfunctional family relationships. It was like the caipirinhas that its Brazilian characters kept mixing — sweet but also sour, and packing a punch. Alas, there are no cocktails in this novel, but if there were, they would have to be Dark and Stormies. It would make sense to credit the Trump administration for the darkness that has overtaken Novey this time around, but she began this book long before the presidential election or the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. Its release fell on Nov. 6 — an important Election Day, with crucial congressional seats on the line. The novel’s political intrigue and corruption, and the sadness that accompanies the sense of helplessness in the face of a great evil, is prescient. Maybe Novey saw it coming. After all, she grew up in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Image The post-revolutionary port city she draws here resembles a “soiled and forgotten heap of laundry.” A mark on Lena’s coat is the “muddy color of a period stain … saturating the cotton of her jacket as if someone had slowly died in it.” Another character, Olga, a dissident bookstore owner and pot dealer who pines for her dead lover, hates overcast days so much that “she would find herself longing most acutely for a heart attack, or an aneurysm — anything to get it over with already.” Her shop is named Seek the Sublime or Die. “Those Who Knew” takes several stabs at magical realism. A sweater like one worn by the young woman Lena suspects Victor of having killed ends up in Lena’s bag. The girl’s bra winds up in her dresser drawer. A slaughtered animal reveals itself to be a dead woman, if just for a second. Time flashes forward bit by bit, revealing an unplanned pregnancy, a few bad marriages, references to 9/11 and criticism of American foreign policy, but at times these seem like misplaced puzzle pieces rather than part of a coherent, hard-won whole. Novey’s first book was a meditation on writing itself, on language and translation (Novey started out as a poet and a translator of Spanish and Portuguese writers). Literary allusions are sprinkled through the new novel: a bit of Kundera here, some Yeats and Akhmatova there. Novey tips her hat to “Sailing to Byzantium,” its “aging narrator, drifting like an ancient paltry thing, no more than a coat on a stick.” And we feel the tired futility in her bones — and ours. There are beautifully bright details — fish scales glistening like sequins, the layers of a croissant flaked and dissolving on Lena’s tongue — that keep us hungry for more, turning the pages toward some sort of resolution. But the villain’s comeuppance seems like an afterthought rather than the cathartic moment it should be. And a last-minute attempt at an optimistic future seems tacked on as well: two boys playing together in a field and Olga throwing her hat into the political ring. Olga, in the reflective diary entries that she writes to her dead lover, asks at one point about Joan of Arc: “How did she stay true to the voices in her head as they led her into the fire?” How indeed? Novey seems older, tired and slightly hopeless. But, then, aren’t we all? Helene Stapinski is the author of three memoirs, of which the latest is “Murder in Matera: A True Story of Passion, Family, and Forgiveness in Southern Italy.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page 19 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Dark and Stormy.

arts ‘Outlander’ Season 4, Episode 10: Not the Guy - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Television Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Television|‘Outlander’ Season 4, Episode 10: Not the Guy Supported by Outlander ‘Outlander’ Season 4, Episode 10: Not the Guy Image Sam Heughan and Sophie Skelton in “Outlander.”CreditCreditAimee Spinks/Starz By Genevieve Valentine Jan. 6, 2019 Season 4, Episode 10: ‘The Deep Heart’s Core’ Brianna was never so compelling as when she cracked Jamie right in the face. Her rape story line may never escape the shadow of the show’s reliance on sexual violence. That said, her early days at Fraser’s Ridge felt more like the beginning of a process than a bandage on a wound, suggesting “Outlander” was trying to make Brianna a full character at the center of this story, however belatedly. And this episode, she unleashes on Jamie and Ian in one of the more painful family scenes since the Fraser reunion. It is part of a shift in Brianna’s arc. She has moved from dull horror to burning anger, confessing to Jamie that she dreams of murdering her rapist. Whatever that suggests for the long term, in the short term it’s clear that she is trying to come to terms with what happened. She declines to terminate the pregnancy on the slim chance it could be Roger’s, and yet her nightmares about Bonnet get worse. But this family feud is also comeuppance for Jamie. And that’s rare enough to feel important. Early in this episode, Jamie goes from “It’s not your fault, Brianna” to devil’s advocate on a dime, so he can goad her into attacking him. Then he pins her in a weirdly loaded sleeper hold and points out that she’s powerless to stop him from killing her. You know, to make her feel better. (The actual heart-to-heart that follows is honest and earnest, but it’s hard to forget that Jamie ran out of patience so fast that a father-daughter half-nelson seemed more expedient than a little more reassurance.) It seems destined to come back and bite him — his confidence the sort that implodes. But on “Outlander,” Jamie is the hero, and he doesn’t tend to face a lot of pushback from characters he respects. Murtagh is still coming over for dinner without a word about how Jamie plans to handle his pledge to the Governor. So the most remarkable thing about this episode is that after Brianna and Claire find out Jamie and Ian dealt some secret violence to Roger, they get mad at Jamie — and stay mad. Honestly, when Brianna castigates him, it is such a shock that it seems to shake the whole story for a moment. Her anger is the fury of someone deeply wronged — and that kind of anger is so rarely directed at Jamie that he seems to short out for a moment, struggling to comprehend the idea that he can’t immediately fix things. It unbalances him so much that in his confusion about the specifics of that night, he falls back on some views that sound distinctly 18th century: “You said he raped you of your virtue! I nearly killed a man. And to think, I was defending your honor!” It shouldn’t be a surprise that things deteriorate for him — Claire is furious at his lies, Brianna has some withering things to say about how they handled Roger, and Bonnet’s name shatters the last of the family peace. But “Outlander” doesn’t often make him face the music like this. “You do not get to be more angry than me,” Brianna snaps at her father, and it’s almost surreal how unsettled he is to hear it. It’s the sort of fight that one hopes will be hard to resolve. Jamie says he is sorry, but the meat of his apology is a promise to get Roger back. It’s honorable enough, if self-serving. But it splits the family because pregnant Brianna can’t make the ride. And Claire is desperate to stay until Brianna makes no bones about how little she trusts the men. On top of her grief over leaving her daughter again, Claire is noticeably fed up with Jamie, who has some apologies left to make. But Jamie’s parting words to Murtagh are an order to find Bonnet. He’s planning to do the same thing again — without asking Brianna what she wants, again. Fundamentally, then, he has learned nothing. It will be very interesting to see what those consequences are. Things were a little charmed for Jamie this season: His marriage thrived, settling came easy, friends unerringly found him, and they flew under political radars. Now things are getting sticky, and the story is holding him to account. May it be as messy as it promises to be. Other Gossip: • Claire and Brianna reminiscing about things they miss was a sweet moment for them. (Though, in a show that tries to deal with sexual politics, it’s odd that there’s a bigger pang for peanut butter than say, basic rights.) • “You will not forget, but time will let you heal.” This is an important concept for Brianna right now. Unfortunate that this seems more about Jamie’s hard-earned wisdom than about Brianna’s trauma. • “My father would never have said the things you said to me. He was a good man.” Poignant and insightful, Brianna! • “… You’re nothing but a savage.” Nope, revoked. • Having Ian mention the Mohawk are “fierce, but honorable” and that “they adopt folk into their tribe” does not actually make up for a subplot full of nameless Mohawk slavers being cruel to their captives. “Outlander” has not done very much to fight or reexamine racist stereotypes of Native Americans this season, and this is not helping. • Murtagh making a beeline outside at the start of the family breakdown is the most relatable thing that has ever happened on this show. • Are they in a position to ask favors from Aunt Jocasta? (And Brianna, whose college roommate is a black woman, is willing to stay on a plantation? Awkward.) • The cliffhanger of whether Roger vanished into the future feels suspenseful only if you wanted him to stick around. Bold assumption.

This Weekend - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Music Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Music|12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend Supported by 12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend Image Mdou MoctarCreditCreditKyle Gustafson/The Washington Post, via Getty Images Jan. 3, 2019 Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. Pop & Rock MARC COHN at City Winery (Jan. 6, 7:30 p.m.). For those who prefer their rock on the softer side and with a healthy dose of blues, singer-songwriter Marc Cowhn — best known for his hit “Walking In Memphis” — is headlining a near-ideal evening of music. Also performing are John Oates and his Good Road Band, who recently released “Arkansas,” a rootsy album designed in part as a tribute to legendary bluesman Mississippi John Hurt, and then Cohn will get vocal support from legendary harmonists the Blind Boys of Alabama. 212-608-0555, citywinery.com MDOU MOCTAR at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 4, 8 p.m.). The robust rock tradition among the Tuareg people — a Berber group with origins around the southern Sahara — has long been represented internationally by artists like Bombino and Tinariwen. Moctar, a singer-songwriter, offers a subtler, more intimate variation on their desert blues with his most recent album “Sousoume Tamachek.” Translated from the Tuareg dialect in which he sings, the title of the soothing, stripped-down release fittingly translates to something like “calm down.” He’s responsible for every note on the album, layering electric and acoustic guitar, percussion, and singing with mesmerizing results. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com NEW POWER GENERATION at Sony Hall (Jan. 4, 7:30 p.m.). Prince’s backing band for over 20 years, the New Power Generation reunited shortly after his death in 2016. While the Revolution, who are also currently touring, were the primary support for Prince’s 1980s output, the New Power Generation — whose long tenure belied a much less consistent personnel — played behind his 1990s and 2000s compositions and performances. Their setlists span the singer’s career, though, for fans new and old who want to hear Prince’s music in as close to its original form as is still possible live. 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com NONAME at Brooklyn Steel (Jan. 5-6, 8 p.m.). Upon first listen, the Chicago rapper’s music sounds laid-back and understated. “I make lullaby rap music,” she explained recently on Twitter, a description as concise and apt as most of her rapid-fire yet still conversational verses. But even though her volume rarely goes above piano, Noname has attitude and depth to spare as she raps over asymmetrical grooves that have a live, unprocessed sound. On her recent full-length debut “Room 25,” there are lines salacious enough to garner their own headlines alongside philosophical manifestos, as on “No Name”: “’Cause when we walk into heaven, nobody’s name’s gonna exist/Just boundless movement for joy, nakedness radiance.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available via the secondary market. 888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com/brooklyn-steel OZOMATLI at Sony Hall (Jan. 5, 7:30 p.m.). The Los Angeles band’s goal has long been to capture that they see as a melange of genres: cumbia, salsa, rock, hip-hop, reggae and funk. This past year was the 20th anniversary of their self-titled debut album, which earned them a spot opening for Santana on the 1999 “Supernatural” tour. Since, they’ve been among the most reliable purveyors of Latin rock, often foregrounding issues around immigration, social justice and worker’s rights (the band’s members first met while trying to unionize a community center). 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com CL SMOOTH at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 10, 8 p.m.). When the rapper released his best-known single “They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)” alongside producer Pete Rock, he was just 23. Over two decades later, the song’s carefully crafted bars and jazz-sampling beat remain etched in hip-hop history, giving its titular reminiscence new meaning. In a recent interview, CL Smooth reflected on how the music has evolved since the duo’s heyday during what’s often called hip-hop’s golden age. “I wouldn’t change anything.” 212-243-4940, sobs.com NATALIE WEINER Jazz Image Arturo O’Farrill will play “Fandango at the Wall” for the first in New York on Sunday at Le Poisson Rouge as part of Winter Jazzfest.CreditJack Vartoogian/Getty Images GLOBALFEST at the Copacabana (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). As always, the 16th annual Globalfest features a broad range of acts from across the world. Highlights this year include the Calcutta-based Pandit Debashish Bhattacharya, who plays Indian ragas on the slide guitar, in a style descended of the sitar; the Cuban mambo revivalists of Orquesta Akokán; and Gato Preto, an electronic duo exploring music from across the African diaspora. All told, the evening boasts performances from a dozen bands across three stages at the Copacabana, one of Manhattan’s most storied nightclubs. globalfest.org CRAIG HARRIS at Nublu 151 (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Harris, a trombonist, is celebrating the release of “Brown Butterfly,” an ambitious album paying homage to the legacy of Muhammad Ali. The suite laces gnarled horn arrangements and spoken tributes to Ali over protean rhythms, drawing on influences as varied as Count Basie’s big band and the drum-and-bass of 1990s London; the music emulates the rugged grace and mercurial power of Ali in the ring. Harris’s band includes Kahlil Kwame Bell on percussion, Calvin Jones on bass, Adam Klipple on piano, Tony Lewis on drums and Jay Rodriguez on saxophone. nublu.net CHRISTIAN SANDS at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Jan. 5-6, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A 29-year-old pianist and bandleader of increasing renown, Sands is aligned with jazz’s straight-ahead mainstream, but he’s got an unbounded inquisitive instinct. He sounds like he listens to Oscar Peterson, Jason Moran and Eddie Palmieri in about equal doses. He performs this Saturday with a quartet including the guitarist Caio Afiune, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer David Rosenthal; that group will likely draw heavily from Sands’s most recent album, “Facing Dragons.” On Sunday, he returns with a trio featuring the bassist Luques Curtis and the drummer Terreon Gully. The latter show is a tribute to Erroll Garner; Sands serves as the creative ambassador for the Erroll Garner Jazz Project, a group dedicated to furthering the canonical pianist’s legacy. 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys JEN SHYU AND JADE TONGUE at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 9, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A vocalist, poet and movement artist, Shyu is equally devoted to open-ended abstraction and absorptive storytelling. Here she presents “In Healing/Zero Grasses,” a new project with her longstanding group, Jade Tongue, that features a characteristically radical admixture of song, spoken poetry and outré improvisation, all aimed at healing humanity’s relationship with the natural environment. Jade Tongue includes Ambrose Akinmusire on trumpet, Mat Maneri on viola, Thomas Morgan on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc BEN WENDEL HIGH HEART AND KENDRICK SCOTT ORACLE at ShapeShifter Lab (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Wendel and Scott are two of the most admired composer-bandleaders among today’s young music students and devotees of jazz’s modern mainstream. Here Wendel, a saxophonist, will present the debut of High Heart, a new acoustic-electric ensemble with the vocalist Michael Mayo, the keyboardists Shai Maestro and Gerald Clayton, the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Nate Wood. Scott, a drummer, will perform with Oracle, a vessel for his shimmering, gently propulsive compositions; in its current iteration, the group includes Sanders on bass, John Ellis on saxophone, Taylor Eigsti on piano and Mike Moreno on guitar. shapeshifterlab.com WINTER JAZZFEST (Jan. 4-12). Now in its 15th year, the Winter Jazzfest has never had a more bountiful lineup of contemporary jazz talent. Its beloved weekend marathon — featuring simultaneous shows at venues across Lower Manhattan — will now stretch across two weekends: a “Half Marathon” will set the pace this Saturday, with a fuller, two-night marathon taking place a week later, on Jan. 11-12. In the week between, one-off concerts will be held nearly every night at a variety of venues. Highlights include Sunday’s New York debut of the pianist Arturo O’Farrill’s “Fandango at the Wall,” a suite he first performed at the United States-Mexican border this past spring, with a multinational federation of musicians; and a concert on Thursday with the saxophone luminaries Pharoah Sanders and Gary Bartz performing together.

arts The Best Movies of 2018 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Movies Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Movies|The Best Movies of 2018 Supported by The Best Movies of 2018 Image The year’s best movies include, clockwise from top left, “Minding the Gap,” “First Reformed,” “Burning,” “Happy as Lazzaro” and “Private Life.”CreditCreditClockwise from bottom left: Jojo Whilden/Netflix; Hulu; A24; Well Go Usa; Netflix By Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott Dec. 5, 2018 Leer en español Our chief film critics single out a Mexican remembrance of things past and four American documentaries about the way we live now. Manohla Dargis’s List | A.O. Scott’s List Manohla Dargis What Could Have Been Some of the most inspiring films I watched this year were made by women who wore long skirts and high-button boots and couldn’t yet vote for president. You can find some of their work in “Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers,” a recently released DVD box set from Kino Lorber and the Library of Congress. (The Blu-ray version has more titles.) Some of these movies were featured in a program at Brooklyn Academy of Music that ran in July, one of several surveys that this vital arts center has dedicated to forgotten and overlooked female directors. The more I watched these films from the beginning of the 20th century, the more I began to think about the movie world — the Hollywood — that could have been. By the late 1920s, women were largely shut out of directing in the American industry until the mid-1960s. If film pioneers like Lois Weber and Alice Guy Blaché had continued, it’s possible that a radically different movie world might have emerged. In my alt-Hollywood fantasy, female and male filmmakers would have worked side by side, perhaps giving us unimagined stories and heroines. That history in turn might have laid the foundation for an equitable present rather than an industry defined by entrenched sexism. This inequity shows no real signs of abating, presumably because sexism has never damaged the movie industry’s bottom line. As of this writing, only a couple of the top 20 movies at the domestic box office have female-driven stories; in a few titles, the prominent female character shares the screen either as part of a romantic couple or a family. None of the 20 were directed by women. And then there is the continuing fallout from the Harvey Weinstein allegations and the #MeToo movement, which my colleague Brooks Barnes reported in November are greatly contributing to a “profound malaise” in the movie capital. “Yap, yap — go back to your kennels,” a movie producer said of Time’s Up, the advocacy group formed in January by producers like Shonda Rhimes and performers like Reese Witherspoon to fight workplace sexual harassment. Barnes was startled by the movie producer’s comment. I was only surprised that he had been honest, even off the record. This producer is just one power broker, but he represents a mind-set that is responsible for mainstream industry that feels both creatively and ethically bankrupt. At this point, I wonder if it would be better for the powerful women in Time’s Up to forget about changing the old industry and just burn it down so they can rebuild it. This malaise has other sources, including the effect Netflix and Amazon are having on the big studios. Then again, these same studios — with their sequels and superheroes — are busily doing their part to turn American cinema into a gushing stream of uniformity. This seems unlikely to change especially given that in July the Walt Disney Company solidified its plans to buy Fox, thereby destroying one of the studios that created Hollywood. Opponents of the proposed deal include the Writers Guild of America West, which severely criticized the merger for furthering the media consolidation that has drastically limited competition. The proof of these limits is evident at the box office, which in recent years has been dominated by branded product, much of it owned by Disney. The studio again leads the box office, having thus far gobbled up a staggering 27 percent of the domestic market share. (A decade ago, it released more features and had less market share.) You can like Disney movies and still believe that oligopoly is bad for movie culture. The same is true of Netflix, which has been showing its muscle in the movie world to feed its platform and which is where Joel and Ethan Coen’s “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” is currently crammed among its thousands of good, bad and indifferent titles — all ready to watch, pause, forget. My 10 favorite movies of the year, in order: 1. ‘Roma’ (Alfonso Cuarón) Image From left, Yalitza Aparicio, Marco Graf and Daniela Demesa in “Roma.”CreditAlfonso Cuarón/Netflix Monumentality is intrinsic to Cuarón’s memory piece, which, alas, means that when it begins streaming on Netflix, viewers won’t be able to fully see — or experience — its wonder. (Stream it on Netflix beginning Dec. 14.) 2. ‘Burning’ (Lee Chang-dong) In this breath-catchingly lovely, terrifying movie, a South Korean woman dances in the fading light as two unworthy men sit, watch and slowly burn down their world. 3. ‘Shoplifters’ (Hirokazu Kore-eda) By turns delicate and brutal, this Japanese drama about a struggling ragtag family is perfectly observed from its first scene to its last, and is a career high point for its director. 4. ‘Zama’ (Lucrecia Martel) Set in the New World in the 18th century, this wonderfully eccentric movie centers on an official of the Spanish empire brought low by hubris and the laughter of women. (Stream it on Amazon; rent it on Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.) 5. ‘Happy as Lazzaro’ (Alice Rohrwacher) Neorealism meets magical realism in this marvelous, surprising movie about an impoverished Italian man, his sprawling tribe and a radically transformed way of life. (Stream it on Netflix.) 6. ‘BlacKkKlansman’ (Spike Lee) Image Laura Harrier and John David Washington in “BlacKkKlansman.”CreditDavid Lee/Focus Features For much of this startling story, set in Colorado Springs in the early 1970s, Lee expertly takes you into a shocking American past that harrowingly leads right back to its agonized present. (Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, GooglePlay and Vudu.) 7. ‘First Reformed’ (Paul Schrader) A deeply moving exploration of faith in the fallen world, Schrader’s triumph feels like both the summation, and the galvanizing beginning, of an extraordinary cinematic career. (Stream it on Amazon; rent it on Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.) 8. ‘The Death of Stalin’ (Armando Iannucci) A blazingly funny writer, Iannucci has become a great director of actors, who with slow burns and pinpoint timing turn a political burlesque into a terrifyingly timely cautionary tale. (Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.) 9. ‘Monrovia, Indiana’ (Frederick Wiseman) In this quietly political Trump-era documentary, Wiseman offers a long, searching look at a small American town where homespun charm exists side by side with steadfast isolationism. 10. ‘Colophon (for the Arboretum Cycle)’ (Nathaniel Dorsky) With their gently nodding, brilliantly colored flowers and shifting shadows, Dorsky’s heart-soaringly beautiful films are reminders that cinema is also about light and form. Honor Roll “At Eternity’s Gate” (see it for Willem Dafoe and the lovely light); “Black Panther” (there’s a lot here, but mostly there is Michael B. Jordan, who can do anything); “Bodied” (rapping and identity politics); “Cold War”; “The Day After”; “Destroyer” (Nicole Kidman badassery); “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” (righteous anger); “Eighth Grade”; “Golden Exits” (Alex Ross Perry’s sandpaper touch is very fine); “The Guardians”; “Hale County This Morning, This Evening”; “If Beale Street Could Talk”; “Custody”; “Isle of Dogs”; “The King”; “Lean on Pete”; “Leave No Trace”; “Lizzie” (good acting with 40 whacks); “Minding the Gap”; “The Other Side of the Wind” (imperfect Orson Welles is still Orson Welles); “RBG” (the OG); “The Rider”; “Shoah: Four Sisters”; “The Sisters Brothers” (John C. Reilly); “Skate Kitchen” (girls + skateboarding); “Sorry to Bother You”; “A Star Is Born” (too much Bradley Cooper, but I love it); “Support the Girls” (Regina Hall deserves more roles like this); “The Third Murder” (more Kore-eda); “Three Identical Strangers” (a must-see); “Vox Lux” (sick, but in a good way); “Western” (a finely calibrated look at men and work). A.O. Scott Starting With Vision Image Willie in “Hale County This Morning, This Evening.”CreditRaMell Ross/Cinema Guild 1. ‘Monrovia, Indiana’ (Frederick Wiseman); ‘Bisbee ’17’ (Robert Greene); ‘Hale County This Morning, This Evening’ (RaMell Ross); ‘Minding the Gap’ (Bing Liu) A four-way tie for first place may look like wanton indecisiveness, but to me these lyrical, visionary documentaries add up to an indelible composite portrait of America right now. At a time when we tend to see ourselves and our fellow citizens as sociological stereotypes and ideological clichés, these highly personal films suggest that a different way of telling the American story — the crazy multiplicity of American stories — may still be possible. Not because the filmmakers offer visions of consensus, but precisely because each one digs deep into the conflicts and contradictions that run through every neighborhood, household and individual heart. “Monrovia,” filmed in a tiny, mostly white heartland town, is the latest work from an 88-year-old master. “Hale County,” set in a rural mostly black part of Alabama, and “Minding the Gap,” set in a mixed Illinois industrial city, are first features by skilled and intuitive young directors. “Bisbee ’17,” named for a mining town in Arizona, is a powerful midcareer foray into historical memory and political strife. These movies touch on issues that often come up in journalistic hot takes or political broadsides, including race, masculinity, inequality and the changing nature of work. Each one forces you to suspend judgment, and to rethink what you thought you knew. They are acts of witness but also, as great documentaries must be, works of art, reminders that the job of the artist and the duty of the citizen are fundamentally the same: to pay attention. (Stream “Minding the Gap” on Hulu.) 2. ‘Happy as Lazzaro’ (Alice Rohrwacher) Rohrwacher’s third feature starts out as a simple fable of rural Italian life, centered on a simple young man living among fellow sharecroppers in an isolated hamlet. By the time he reaches the big city, about halfway in, the film has already infused neorealism with an old, strange magic. By the end it has transcended all categories and conventions and revealed something about the tragedy of modern life that seems almost unspeakably ancient. (Stream it on Netflix.) 3. ‘First Reformed’ (Paul Schrader) Ethan Hawke, as a Protestant minister staring into the abyss of his own soul and the gathering darkness of climate-change catastrophe, gives a performance that is at once unassuming and overpowering. Schrader distills the spiritual and cinematic preoccupations that have defined his career as a writer (“Taxi Driver”) and director (“American Gigolo”) into an austere and elegant study in metaphysical and political anguish. Yes, the movie is topical. Among the topics under discussion are the meaning of human existence and the survival of the planet. (Stream it on Amazon; rent it on Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.) 4. ‘Private Life’ (Tamara Jenkins) Image Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti in “Private Life.”CreditJojo Whilden/Netflix A movie about liberal-minded, literary-bohemian heterosexual New Yorkers that finds something new to say surely counts as a minor miracle. A comedy that is sharp but not cruel, a drama that is poignant but not sentimental, an informative and unflinching look at fertility treatments — “Private Life” is all those things. And, maybe most of all, it is a wonder cabinet of incisive, unshowy performances, from Molly Shannon, John Carroll Lynch, Kayli Carter, Paul Giamatti and above all the splendid and fearless Kathryn Hahn. (Stream it on Netflix.) 5. ‘Roma’ (Alfonso Cuarón) You could almost live inside Cuarón’s intricate, pulsing wide-screen compositions, borne along on the movements of his sweeping, swooping camera. A lot of people do live here, in a world conjured from the director’s own memories of growing up in the wealthy Mexico City neighborhood that gives the film its name. In no great hurry to make a point or advance a plot, he takes in Mexican politics, changing family dynamics and, above all, the dreams and disappointments of a young housekeeper named Cleo, played with heart-stopping candor and sly elegance by Yalitza Aparicio. (Stream it on Netflix beginning Dec. 14.) 6. ‘Let the Sunshine In’ (Claire Denis) The first time I saw this piquant, episodic chronicle of a middle-aged artist’s bad romances, I was puzzled and a little irritated. Juliette Binoche’s character was so abrasive! The men she was with were so awful! But I still couldn’t look away. A second viewing knocked me out, and I kept coming back with new questions. How can something so true to the rhythms of real life and the zigzags of an individual temperament still hold together as a movie? How can a movie be so artful and seem so artless? How can a film about such thoroughly tiresome people be one that I can’t imagine ever getting tired of watching? (Stream it on Hulu; rent it on Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.) 7. ‘Can You Ever Forgive Me?’ (Marielle Heller) Casting Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant as witty, cynical partners in crime in early ’90s Manhattan is pretty much foolproof. They would be fun to watch if all they did was insult each other over drinks. They do a lot of that, and this movie — based on the real-life escapades of literary forger Lee Israel and her accomplice, Jack Hock — is admirably modest and specific in scale. It doesn’t preach or pose, but in the fine grain of its characters and the skill of its performers (including Dolly Wells as a sweet and credulous bookseller), it achieves a kind of perfection. 8. ‘BlacKkKlansman’ (Spike Lee) Ebullient and indignant, Lee’s best nondocumentary feature in quite some time delves into some ugly American history — including film history — to remind us that it’s still being written. Based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American detective who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the ’70s, the film is a wild mash-up of genres and styles. It’s an interracial buddy picture (with John David Washington and Adam Driver), a blaxploitation action-romance (with Washington and Laura Harrier) and a real-life horror movie. The last scenes, which trace the continuity of racism from “The Birth of a Nation” in 1915 to Charlottesville to 2017 is a tour de force of political filmmaking and blunt, brilliant Spike Lee dialectics. (Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, GooglePlay, YouTube and Vudu.) 9. ‘Capernaum’ (Nadine Labaki) Image Zain al-Rafeea in “Capernaum.”CreditSony Pictures Classics Naturalism meets melodrama in this harrowing, hectic tale of a lost boy’s adventures in the slums and shantytowns of Beirut. Twelve-year-old Zain witnesses and undergoes horrors that don’t seem exaggerated, but Zain al-Rafeea, the young actor who plays him, endures the worst with Keatonesque stoicism and Chaplinesque empathy. Not that this is a comedy, exactly, but as in her previous features (“Caramel” and “Where Do We Go Now?”) Labaki refuses to lose sight of the exuberance, grit and humor that people hold onto even in moments of the greatest desperation. 10. ‘The Favourite’ (Yorgos Lanthimos) The twisty mischief of the plot — court intrigue in the palace of Queen Anne overlaid with sexual treachery among the her courtiers — is crisply handled, but what lands this movie on the list are its many moments of scenic and thespian audacity. Emma Stone makes rape jokes. Rachel Weisz dispatches pigeons with a front-loaded rifle. Olivia Colman complains of gout. There are bunnies, duck races and a human menagerie of fops, fools and femmes fatales. The moral is that power corrupts, and corruption is fun. The Runners-Up In alphabetical order: “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs”; “Black Panther”; “Custody”; “If Beale Street Could Talk”; “The Rider”; “Shoplifters”; “Sorry to Bother You”; “Support the Girls”; “Western”; “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”; “Zama.” Related Coverage What the Movies Taught Me About Being a Woman In the wake of Harvey Weinstein and #MeToo, our critic re-examines what she learned — and had to unlearn — from the big screen.Nov. 30, 2018 The Best TV Shows of 2018 Another year brought another embarrassment of TV riches, as departing favorites gave way to audacious new series, and streaming services brought viewers a world of outstanding foreign fare.Dec. 3, 2018 The Best Theater of 2018 It was a year when classics were reincarnated in deceptively modest interpretations, conventional story forms were tossed aside and strong voices roared.Dec. 4, 2018 Manohla Dargis has been the co-chief film critic since 2004.

arts Liza Redfield, Who Broke a Broadway Barrier, Is Dead at 94 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Obituaries Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Obituaries|Liza Redfield, Who Broke a Broadway Barrier, Is Dead at 94 Supported by Liza Redfield, Who Broke a Broadway Barrier, Is Dead at 94 Image Liza Redfield at a performance of “The Music Man” at the Majestic Theater in 1960. “Woman Conducts ‘Music Man’ Today,” The New York Times announced in a headline that July, when Ms. Redfield became the first woman engaged full time as the conductor of a Broadway pit orchestra.CreditCreditAssociated Press By Neil Genzlinger Dec. 28, 2018 Liza Redfield, who broke a barrier on July 4, 1960, when she raised her baton at the Majestic Theater to start a performance of “The Music Man,” becoming the first woman to be the full-time conductor of a Broadway pit orchestra, died on Dec. 23 in Manhattan. She was 94. Her death, at the Amsterdam Nursing Home, was announced by Barbara Sandler, her longtime friend and caregiver. Other women had served as assistant conductors and might have filled in on Broadway podiums, but Ms. Redfield was widely reported to be the first engaged full time when she took over “The Music Man,” the crowd-pleasing musical with a score by Meredith Willson, which had been running since 1957. She replaced Herbert Greene, the show’s original conductor as well as one of its producers, and the changeover made news. “Woman Conducts ‘Music Man’ Today,” The New York Times announced in a headline. Time magazine, in gushingly sexist language typical of the period, rhapsodized, “With striking Titian-red hair, plus face and figure to match, Liza Redfield has the looks for anything except what she is: Broadway’s first full-time woman conductor.” She would go on to serve as musical director for three other Broadway shows, but all were flops, and she never quite settled into the top tier of the conducting world, which was dominated by men back then and remains so today. There are few conducting opportunities in general, either on Broadway or in the classical music world, and for a woman during the prime of Ms. Redfield’s career there were fewer still. “A lot of it had to do with the boys’ club,” Richard Riskin, a conductor and musician who knew Ms. Redfield for some 40 years, said in a telephone interview. “She crashed the glass ceiling, but there was almost nowhere to go.” Liza Redfield was a stage name — Mr. Riskin said she once told him “Redfield” was inspired by her red hair. She was born Betty Weisman on Aug. 11, 1924, in Philadelphia. Her father, Isaac, was a tailor, and her mother, Sophie (Becker) Weisman, was a homemaker. Ms. Redfield was a piano prodigy, performing recitals by the age of 8. She graduated from the Philadelphia High School for Girls and received a music degree at the University of Pennsylvania. She contemplated a career as a concert pianist, but, she said, something was missing. “With piano I was facile,” she told Mademoiselle magazine in 1960. “I learned too quickly. I never really sat down and worked at it, and I think that’s why eventually I got so I just didn’t care.” She took various jobs playing piano and arranging, and one day in the mid-1950s friends who were recording the songs from “The Amazing Adele,” a now-forgotten musical that never made it to Broadway. asked her to play piano at the session. Notable Deaths 2018: Music A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Aug. 3, 2018 “There was a 14-piece orchestra and no one to conduct it,” she told Time in 1960. “I suddenly found myself playing the piano and conducting the orchestra, and I loved it.” She received a scholarship to study conducting under Vladimir Brailowsky, and by the late 1950s she was getting work not only as a pianist but also as a conductor and musical director, including for the summer theater-under-a-tent operations that were popular at the time. A few women in the middle part of the 20th century were making inroads into the male conducting world, like Nadia Boulanger, the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic, and the choral conductor Margaret Hillis. But the obstacles were formidable. In 1958, when Ms. Redfield was engaged for the summer season by the Music Circle Theater in Michigan, an article in The Detroit Free Press — written by a woman, Jean Sharley — inadvertently demonstrated the mind-set. “Down the aisle, in a size 12 Oleg Cassini, will walk Liza Redfield, 27, shapely New Yorker with pale blue eyes, creamy skin, flaming red hair, a baton and entirely too much class,” Ms. Sharley wrote, imagining her debut. It added: “Every masculine eye will follow her six-step descent into the orchestra pit. Some husbands will not lift their eyes to the stage all evening.” Her work in the regional trenches led to jobs conducting for two Off Broadway musicals in 1960, the short-lived “Miss Emily Adams” and the better-received “Ernest in Love,” a musical adaptation of “The Importance of Being Earnest.” She was a few weeks into the run of that show when she got the call to take over “The Music Man.” Despite the grating tone of much of the coverage, Ms. Redfield gamely went along with most efforts to publicize her breakthrough. “But,” Mademoiselle noted, “a suggestion from the ‘Music Man’ press agent that she pose for publicity shots in a bathing suit was one too many.” She did appear as the guest on the television game show “What’s My Line?,” on which a panel of celebrities tried to guess the occupation of the mystery guest by asking questions. The segment ended up being particularly hilarious thanks especially to Dorothy Kilgallen, one of the panelists. “Would you say that your services were more mental than physical?” she asked early on, a question Ms. Redfield was unsure how to answer. The panel eventually established that Ms. Redfield had something to do with a Broadway show but couldn’t figure out what. With time running out, Ms. Kilgallen, referencing another hit musical of the day, asked, “Are you one of the strippers in ‘Gypsy’?” After “The Music Man,” Ms. Redfield was music director and conductor for the Broadway shows “Sophie” (1963), “Good News” (1974) and “Charlie and Algernon,” none of which lasted more than two weeks. She worked steadily through the 1980s, mostly with touring Broadway shows, pre-Broadway tryouts and smaller musicals at places like the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami. She was also a composer, creating works for, among other things, the 1968 gala marking the reopening of the renovated Ford’s Theater in Washington. Ms. Redfield was married briefly to Ira Leff. She leaves no immediate survivors. Amid all the hoopla about her 1960 breakthrough, Ms. Redfield tried to make a simple point whenever she was interviewed. “Music is neither masculine nor feminine,” she told Time. “You don’t have to be one of the boys to be a good conductor.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Liza Redfield, 94; Broke Broadway Barrier.

Schmidt and David Waldstein Dec. 6, 2018 Two years ago, lawyers for Major League Baseball sent a confidential document to the players’ union containing startling allegations against two of the game’s top agents. The document — a signed affidavit from a man who had worked for the agents — said the agents had helped him to cover up a star player’s use of performance-enhancing drugs and to break other union rules. The lawyers from Major League Baseball acknowledged to the union that the former employee had a checkered past — the employee had gone to prison for his role distributing banned drugs to players and he said he helped the former All-Star outfielder Melky Cabrera cover up a positive drug test. But M.L.B.’s lawyers had previously sent the union information from others making similar allegations about the same agents, Sam and Seth Levinson. They told the union they found the former employee’s new claims credible. The players’ union, which unlike M.L.B. is empowered to police agents, initially acknowledged that the allegations were serious, and pledged to investigate. But since then, the union has failed to interview either the former employee, Juan Carlos Nunez, or others he said could corroborate his claims. Nor has it followed through on a promise to provide the commissioner’s office with any details about its previous investigations into the agents. The dispute has been a source of deep frustration for Major League Baseball, which sees the union as unwilling to work with the commissioner’s office on many fronts. And it has exposed a gap in baseball’s drug testing program, which is generally considered among the strictest in sports: M.L.B. has no power to regulate the agents who work in the game or to punish any who may facilitate performance-enhancing drug use by their clients. Only the players and their union can do that. The union and its head, the former player Tony Clark, declined several requests for comment. Clark said Thursday that the union as a rule does not comment on investigations. But its apparent unwillingness to hold the Levinsons and their agency, ACES, to account has also caused resentment among other agents, many of whom have privately expressed dismay that the players’ union failed to fully investigate the accusations against the Levinsons, and contend the union has shown favoritism toward them. Nunez, the former employee, in February sued the Levinsons, who dispute all the claims he has made against them and continue to represent star players. But M.L.B. continues to believe Nunez is telling the truth. “Major League Baseball turned over the information from Mr. Nunez regarding the Levinsons’ alleged conduct to the M.L.B.P.A. because it is the union’s responsibility to regulate agents,” the commissioner’s office said in a statement. “Despite numerous requests, M.L.B. was disappointed it was not given the terms of whatever settlement that was reached between the M.L.B.P.A. and the Levinsons, and M.L.B. became aware that the Levinsons would be allowed to continue to represent players.” In a statement, the Levinsons called Nunez a “liar and convicted felon,” and said they had no knowledge of his criminal activities, and that Nunez’s affidavit to M.L.B. mirrors the “baseless claims he raised in his lawsuit.” “As for M.L.B.,” the statement continued, “they have opposed a strong union and our advocacy for players’ rights for decades, so it is unfortunate but not surprising that they have found it convenient to jump on Nunez’s bandwagon.” Club owners have an inherently adversarial relationship with agents, whose duty is to extract as much money as possible from teams for their clients. But the past two baseball commissioners, Bud Selig and Rob Manfred, were so troubled by the repeated allegations by former associates against the Levinsons that they took the unusual step — at least three times in the past six years — of providing the union with information tying the Levinsons to their players’ use of banned drugs. In 2012, Nunez, then an employee of the Levinsons, took the blame for facilitating Cabrera’s drug use and trying to cover it up. Cabrera was suspended for 50 games, and the union barred Nunez from being an agent for life. He spent three months in prison for his role in referring players to a South Florida clinic, Biogenesis, that provided athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. But after his release in 2015, Nunez went to Major League Baseball and said he took the blame for the Cabrera situation in exchange for a payment from ACES he never accepted, and he said that now he wanted to tell the truth. Before M.L.B. took Nunez’s affidavit, it had one of its outside lawyers, Andrew Levi, investigate Nunez’s claims. Image The former All-Star Melky Cabrera was suspended for 50 games after failing a doping test in 2012.CreditTom Szczerbowski/Getty Images In an interview last week, Levi said he found Nunez to be “completely credible.” Levi, who spent several days interviewing Nunez and reviewing documents, said it was nearly impossible to believe that Nunez had acted alone in the cover-up. “This was all over his pay grade,” Levi said about the sophistication of the effort to come up with a false back story to explain the positive drug test. “It is inconceivable that he was the quarterback here.” In December 2015, Nunez provided a sworn affidavit to M.L.B. in which he asserted that the Levinsons had directed him through each stage of the Cabrera cover-up, and he gave the commissioner’s office photographic evidence that he said backed up his claims. (The Levinsons contended “the photographs are doctored and, like Nunez himself, cannot be trusted.”) In the affidavit, Nunez also told investigators of how the Levinsons directed him to make payments of close to $50,000 to family members and friends of the pitcher Fernando Rodney from 2010 to 2012 to persuade Rodney to stay with ACES at a time the pitcher was threatening to leave the agency. Those payments would be a violation of union rules. The Levinsons said the only payment they made was for training and transportation — which are allowed under union rules — and not as an inducement to keep Rodney as a client. The union had investigated the Levinsons twice before for their possible role in players’ drug use, and each time it cleared the agents. After the second investigation, the union said the Levinsons — and Nez Balelo, another agent who was also investigated over similar claims surrounding Ryan Braun’s positive drug test and cover-up in 2011 — all remained in “good standing.” But it had never talked to Nunez, and it refused to share any of the details of its investigation with M.L.B., angering the commissioner’s office. Nunez had declined to cooperate with union investigators because he was facing criminal charges at the time. After M.L.B. forwarded his new affidavit to the players association in 2016, the union acknowledged the seriousness of the charges and promised to investigate the Levinsons again. “Given the seriousness of the allegations made in the affidavit, we will be investigating this matter further under the MLBPA Agent Regulations and we aim to do so in a timely fashion,” the union’s general counsel, David Prouty, said in a letter to M.L.B. in 2016. The union then told Nunez’s lawyers it wanted to speak with him but under certain conditions, including its insistence that he sign a nondisclosure agreement. After some negotiations about the length of the proposed agreement — the union wanted the time limit to be at its discretion, meaning it could have been in effect forever — Nunez refused to sign it. On July 27, 2017, an attorney for the union told Nunez’s lawyer it “has decided not to meet with Mr. Nunez at this time.” Nunez said he has not heard from the union again. He said in an interview with The New York Times that he felt he was doing the union a favor by providing it with information it needed to investigate the allegations against the Levinsons, but he saw no need for him to agree to keep silent. “If, in fact, they wanted to get to the bottom of it,” said Jose Batista, Nunez’s lawyer, “why could they put so many conditions on interviewing Juan, subject to their own unfair discretion as to whether they will ever allow him to talk?” Moe Fodeman, an expert on white-collar and internal investigations and a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in New York, said that if investigators are refusing to talk to witnesses who may have information because they will not sign nondisclosure agreements, that can call into question the legitimacy of the inquiry. “At the end of the day, if the person is the only one with information concerning a serious allegation, there may be no choice but to forgo an NDA if there’s going to be a legitimate internal investigation,” he said. The union also appears to have declined to investigate Nunez’s claims about how Rodney’s family members were given secret payments in the hopes that they would persuade the player to stay with the agency. Nunez told M.L.B. that one of Rodney’s cousins, Cila Mabel Hernandez, would confirm the payments. In an interview with The New York Times, Hernandez said she had not been contacted by the union. Erik Groothuis, Nunez’s attorney in the lawsuit against the Levinsons, said Nunez originally tried to get “justice” through M.L.B. two years before he filed it. “That didn’t happen,” Groothuis said, “and there’s ACES still getting paid for the players that Juan brought to them, while he is permanently barred from working in baseball.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: A Blind Spot On Doping.

sport Brian Bowen II and the Real Victims of N.C.A.A. Scandals - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Brian Bowen II and the Real Victims of N.C.A.A. Scandals Supported by On College Basketball Brian Bowen II and the Real Victims of N.C.A.A. Scandals Image Brian Bowen II is playing for the Sydney Kings instead of a college in the United States largely because of adults who behaved badly.CreditCreditDarryl Oumi/Getty Images By Marc Tracy Oct. 11, 2018 The lead prosecutor’s opening questions for Brian Bowen Sr. were basic, establishing how he figured into a case that has once again exposed the seedy underbelly of college sports. Bowen wore a blue suit and a blue tie. “What is his name?” Edward B. Diskant, an assistant United States attorney, asked Bowen about his son last Thursday. “Brian Bowen II.” “Does he go by any nicknames?” “Tugs.” As a baby, Bowen Sr. explained later, Tugs Bowen had a habit of tugging on his mother’s hair. This was long before he became the seemingly most undeserving victim in the latest college basketball scandal. “Is Tugs presently in college?” Diskant asked. “No.” “Why not?” Bowen Sr., 50, never answered that question directly. His voice caught. His eyes filled with tears. Then he began to sob. He did not stop for some time. After 10 or 15 seconds, Diskant asked the judge if this might be a good time for a break, and the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, eagerly agreed. As the jury filed out in front of Bowen Sr., he half-turned away from them and the rest of the room, and continued to sob. Tugs Bowen, 20, was not there, on the top floor of Manhattan’s federal courthouse, to see his father break down during this trial. He was 10,000 miles away, in Australia, where his professional basketball team, the Sydney Kings, was preparing for its season. Tugs Bowen is not in college because prosecutors said his father agreed to accept $100,000 from Adidas if his son agreed to play for the University of Louisville, one of the most prominent teams Adidas sponsors. In testimony, which began Thursday and concluded Tuesday, Bowen Sr. confirmed his role in the alleged scheme. And yet, according to prosecutors, Tugs Bowen is not the formal victim in the case. And that is why Tugs Bowen is in Australia, instead of embarking on a traditional basketball career path in college, bearing the brunt of the punishment for adults behaving badly. Here are the charges in the case that turned college basketball on its head, prompting fears that the ordinary way of doing business — quietly compensating top players in violation of N.C.A.A. amateurism rules — could lead not only to college discipline but to criminal penalties: The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York accused Adidas’s former head of global basketball marketing, Jim Gatto; another former Adidas employee, Merl Code Jr.; and an aspiring agent, Christian Dawkins, of committing fraud by scheming to funnel money from Adidas to the families of basketball recruits. In exchange, those recruits would commit to college teams the sneaker company sponsored. The three men have all pleaded not guilty. The charges, first filed in September 2017, prompted the formation of a blue-ribbon N.C.A.A. panel and reforms, though those reforms are unlikely to change college sports significantly. They felled the career of a Hall of Fame coach who is a millionaire many times over. They also terminated the college career of Tugs Bowen, a highly rated player, before it ever got started. Tugs Bowen will never play a minute of college basketball. A career in the N.B.A. now seems like a murky proposition. Image Brian Bowen Sr. arriving at federal court in New York. He has testified that he accepted money in exchange for committing his son to basketball teams.CreditMark Lennihan/Associated Press When the allegations were publicized, on the eve of last college basketball season, Louisville removed Bowen, a freshman, from practices. He later transferred to South Carolina, though he was not permitted to play. Then he elected to turn pro, with the N.C.A.A. indicating he would need to sit at least another season because of the allegations. Then he withdrew from the N.B.A. draft a few weeks before it happened. Later, he landed in Australia. The average man on the street would probably identify Tugs Bowen as the apparent innocent harmed by the defendants’ alleged misdeeds. But according to the prosecution’s legal theory, the four universities — Louisville, Kansas, Miami and North Carolina State, all Adidas-backed — are the victims. The actions of shoe company executives and members of these college’s basketball staffs defrauded them because their actions exposed the universities to the economic harm that could result from N.C.A.A. penalties, prosecutors said. “These defendants caused universities to give scholarships based on fraudulent information, and that fraud occurred because of the defendants’ lies and deceit and greed,” Eli J. Mark said in the prosecution’s opening statement. The four universities have generally pledged their cooperation with the prosecution (and a likely N.C.A.A. investigation in the future) while refraining from extensive comment. A Louisville spokesman said the university was “monitoring the proceedings” and in contact with the N.C.A.A. On Tuesday, Bowen Sr. testified that the former associate head coach for Louisville gave him $1,300 last summer. “The prosecution has not suggested any wrongdoing by the university or its coaches,” a Kansas spokesman said. “We have no tolerance for those who would choose to damage the reputation of this great university,” North Carolina State’s athletic director, Debbie Yow, said in a statement. Miami declined to comment. The government has attempted to piece together the scheme in which the defendants sought to give Bowen Sr. four $25,000 installments over a year and cover their tracks via phony purchase orders and his fake designation as a “consultant.” Bowen Sr. had accepted cash in exchange for his son’s basketball play for years, he said: for playing for an A.A.U. team sponsored by Adidas, for playing for a different A.A.U. team sponsored by Nike, for playing for an Indiana prep school and for playing for Louisville. Assistant coaches from other teams, all sponsored by Nike — Texas, Arizona, Creighton, Oklahoma State — had offered Bowen Sr. substantial sums for Tugs Bowen’s commitment through Dawkins, a family friend, Bowen Sr. said. The athletic directors at Texas and Creighton said in statements that internal reviews had found no evidence to back up Bowen Sr.’s testimony. An Oklahoma State spokesman declined to comment. Arizona did not respond to a request for comment. Image The former sports agent Christian Dawkins has pleaded not guilty to charges he plotted to pay Brian Bowen Sr. $100,000 in exchange for his son’s commitment to play basketball for Louisville.CreditMark Lennihan/Associated Press Tugs Bowen had no idea about any of this, Bowen Sr. insisted repeatedly. For instance, Bowen Sr. detailed a 2015 meeting in his family’s hometown, Saginaw, Mich., in which a coach on Adidas’s A.A.U. circuit, T.J. Gassnola, offered him $25,000 if his son played for an Adidas-backed team. (Gassnola, who has pleaded guilty to a fraud charge, began his testimony Wednesday afternoon.) When Diskant asked whether Bowen Sr. had invited his son to the meeting, he replied: “Of course not, no.” “Why not?” “I mean, I don’t want him to be involved in something that’s wrong or something like that,” Bowen Sr. said. The defendants’ strategy has been to acknowledge that they broke N.C.A.A. rules but that it is not criminal behavior. And, they add, the colleges cannot be victims because the defendants saw themselves as benefiting the colleges by helping them obtain top players. “This isn’t going to be a ‘who did it’ kind of case or even so much of a ‘what did he do’ kind of case,” Mark C. Moore, one of Code’s lawyers, said in his opening argument. “This case is all about the why.” It is also not a case likely to be decided on the relative likability of Brian Bowen Sr. He admitted on Tuesday to lying to the F.B.I. more than once and to disposing of a second phone that he had used to make illicit recruiting-related communications after it was subpoenaed. (He had referred to the second phone as his “Batphone.”) He agreed that he had illegally sold food stamp cards, though he said he had been trying to help people. He signed a nonprosecution agreement in exchange for his testimony. But he also insisted that throughout his son’s basketball career, his first priority had been placing his son in the ideal on-court situation, not cashing in on his son’s talents. He had wanted Tugs Bowen to play at Arizona, he said, and though Dawkins had told Bowen Sr. there was money on the table for that, Bowen Sr.’s main reasoning was that Arizona excelled at developing tall shooting guards like his 6-foot-7 son. When two players similar in style to his son elected to return to Arizona after testing N.B.A. waters, he said, the Bowen family turned its attention to Louisville, whose shooting guard, Donovan Mitchell, had chosen to enter the N.B.A. draft. Throughout his testimony, Bowen Sr. usually stuck to a few words per answer: “Yes.” “That would be fair.” “I don’t recall that.” But at one point on Tuesday, he issued a rare editorial comment when, during the direct examination, the discussion of Tugs Bowen’s tattered college eligibility arose. “I still think my son is a victim,” he said, “and I always will.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Who Are Real Victims In N.C.A.A.

sport At Manchester United, Jose Mourinho Could No Longer Hide Behind His Past - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Soccer Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Soccer|At Manchester United, Jose Mourinho Could No Longer Hide Behind His Past Supported by On Soccer At Manchester United, Jose Mourinho Could No Longer Hide Behind His Past Image José Mourinho had long coveted the chance to work at Manchester United, calling it a “special honor” after his appointment in the summer of 2016.CreditCreditPeter Powell/EPA, via Shutterstock By Rory Smith Dec. 18, 2018 MANCHESTER, England — José Mourinho was almost out of time. He had only a few hours before Manchester United’s power brokers would begin to discuss, in private, the prospect of drawing the curtain on his reign as the club’s manager. He had less than two days before it would all be over. He did not know that, not for certain, as he sat in front of the news media at Anfield on Sunday evening. He has been around for long enough to have had an inkling of what was coming, though. To have had a sense that defeat at Liverpool may have been one defeat too many, that the gap between United, sixth in the Premier League, and its old rival, perched at the top, had grown too wide. Mourinho looked, then, a man in need of comfort, and solace. There has been precious little of it in these last few months, as Manchester United’s season has lurched from disappointment into despair. There has always been a crisis around the corner: that is the way it is, at a club this size, and it is the way Mourinho makes it, too. On Tuesday, the club ended that crisis and released Mourinho. All season, there had only been one place Mourinho could go for escape: a place where he is never questioned, where he is the lord of all he surveys, where he has an answer for even the most searching of questions. At Anfield, on Sunday, he went there again: talking about how great he was in the past. Mourinho’s former glories have been a theme this season: how frequently they are mentioned has tended to exist in inverse proportion to how well Manchester United is playing. It was after a 3-0 defeat at home to Tottenham in August that Mourinho demanded more “respect, respect, respect,” and took time to remind everyone that he had won more Premier League titles himself than all of the other 19 managers in the division put together. “Two for them, three for me,” he said. It was after his team conceded a late equalizer to Chelsea that he responded to the taunts of the home crowd by raising three fingers, one for each of those Premier League titles. It was as his team was being humbled at home to Juventus that he made the same gesture to the Italian team’s fans, this time, in reference to the three trophies he had won as manager of Inter Milan, their great rival. There was defiance in those gestures, in those words. Mourinho’s addiction to the past may have been compulsive, reflexive, but at least he was coming out fighting. At first, anyway. The more Mourinho played the trump card, the more it started to look like the most transparent of bluffs. On Sunday, when he played it again, it seemed more than anything an act of desperation: Mourinho holed up in his last refuge, surrounded by his memories, clutching his mementos close to him, firing wildly into the dark. When he compared Liverpool — the team that had just condemned him to yet another loss, forced him to endure yet another humiliation — to the F.C. Porto team that made his name and announced his greatness to the world, there was, at least, a semblance of logic. Liverpool, like Porto, he said, is “fast, intense, aggressive, physical, they have an objective.” By the time he was name-checking the players he had worked with at Real Madrid — “young” versions of Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain — it had taken on the air of a LinkedIn profile. He rounded the whole thing off with a gratuitous mention of Inter, the team he turned into European champions. He was no longer talking about the merits of Jurgen Klopp’s team. As ever with Mourinho, none of this was intended as praise for a superior opponent; there is, after all, no club Mourinho takes more joy in belittling than Liverpool. No, it was something else, the same thing it has always been: a reminder of all that he has achieved, all that he has won. And yet, as United’s season drifted, as Mourinho has meticulously constructed a set of alternative facts in which he is not to blame for that failure but the ultimate victim of it, his interminable regurgitation of his own greatness has not served to remind anyone of the heights he once scaled, but acted as proof of how far he has fallen. Mourinho’s calling card has always been that he is a winner. That is what separates him from those of his peers who talk sanctimoniously about philosophy or who take pleasure in the journey. He has mocked them mercilessly, from that “specialist in failure” jibe at Arsene Wenger to his barbed remarks about Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino in the last year or so. Winning is what convinced United, at the second time of asking, to invite him in back in 2016. There were misgivings about the chaos that tends to follow in his wake, but United felt it had little choice. Manchester City had appointed Pep Guardiola, Liverpool Klopp, Chelsea Antonio Conte. It needed a guarantee of success. Enter Jose. He did win, picking up the Europa League and the Carabao Cup in his first season, but those were not the trophies United had envisaged him delivering. Mourinho, for neither the first nor the last time, would be hung by his own words: he had previously insisted he would not celebrate winning the second-tier Europa League. It was beneath him. How gleefully he clung on to that triumph, though, became a metaphor for his reign. Mourinho spent some $440 million on players, and complained bitterly that Manchester United — among the richest clubs in the world — did not have the finances to compete with its rivals. That may have been true of Manchester City. It was less obviously true of, say, Tottenham, three places above United in the league. His relationships with his players, one by one, broke down. Paul Pogba was the most high profile — Mourinho would write to Woodward to tell him he had tried everything, from criticizing him privately to criticizing him publicly, but could not find a way to get the best out of the World Cup-winning France midfielder — but he was not the only one. Luke Shaw, Anthony Martial, Eric Bailly, Marcus Rashford — pretty much everyone drew his ire sooner or later. He bemoaned how little character, how little grit, these young players had. “Spoiled brats,” he called them. He could not inspire them, motivate them, as easily as he once had. After Anfield, the club felt enough was enough. It will appoint a manager, most likely a former player — Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer has been mentioned — to see it through to the end of the season, and then move for a permanent replacement. Pochettino has long been the primary target. Pochettino is not a winner, of course. He has won no trophies at all as a manager, as Mourinho, outraged that Tottenham should have been attracting praise for such trifling things as smart recruitment and promotion of young players, has noted previously. That he is so appealing nonetheless is telling. It is important that he is willing to work within a structure, rather than expecting the whole club to be overhauled in line with his whims. It is important that he sees the benefits in promoting youth, does not meet the slightest of setbacks by demanding to see the bank balance, and seems to be able to find common ground with very rich, very talented young men. Pochettino — like Klopp, or Maurizio Sarri, or Pep Guardiola — does that. He stands for something: a way of running a club, a way of playing the game. His beliefs, sincerely held, can be packaged, presented and, ultimately, sold. Attractive soccer can be marketed across the globe; it can draw in new fans and retain the affection of old ones. Mourinho does not offer that. By the end, his United had no discernible character, strictly limited aesthetic appeal. It was as much the approach that condemned him as the results, and it is precisely that which will make him unpalatable to those clubs that once courted him relentlessly when he decides he is ready to return to work. The drama, the tension, the scheming might all be worth it, if the product on the field was compelling. If it is not, it is too high a price to pay. That is not to say he will not work again, or that he is finished at the elite level: Real Madrid, no less, believe for reasons best known to Florentino Perez that Mourinho can lead the rejuvenation of that club. But it is hard to avoid the suspicion that wherever he goes next, what he provides is no longer what owners and executives want, or what clubs or players need. No matter how glittering his list of achievements, no matter how comforting his past, Jose Mourinho is almost out of time. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: As His Standing Fell at Manchester United, Mourinho Leaned More and More on His Past.

Arike Ogunbowale had 17 points and 10 rebounds, but only 5 points after halftime. Jessica Shepard scored 13, Marina Mabrey had 11 and Brianna Turner 10 for Notre Dame (7-1). Williams scored 16 points — one off her career high of 17 against Purdue on Nov. 24 — in the first 10 minutes on 7-of-8 shooting as UConn forged a 27-22 lead. Her basket had given UConn an 8-6 lead with 6:36 left in the quarter, a lead the Huskies would not relinquish. Turner blocked two shots by Samuelson in the second quarter as the Irish kept the 6-foot-3 senior scoreless on 0-for-7 shooting. But Samuelson contributed in other areas with six assists, three rebounds, a block and a steal as the Huskies maintained their halftime advantage. Four times, Notre Dame closed within a basket of tying UConn. But a 2:30 span without a field goal allowed the Huskies to pull out to a 43-35 lead. Mabrey made two free throws to pull the Irish to 44-41 with 1:20 left in the first half, but she missed a tying 3-point attempt and looked winded, perhaps the result of missing the first five games with a quad injury. The Huskies started the third quarter on an 11-5 run to take a 9-point lead on Walker’s 3-pointer. During the run Samuelson scored her first 4 points, 2 from the free-throw line and 2 more on a driving lay-in. But the Irish chipped away and got to 55-53 on Mabrey’s 3 with 4:20 to play. Samuelson and Williams then led a 10-6 run for a 65-59 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Auriemma used only six players in the game. The Irish started four players who started in their victory over UConn in last year’s N.C.A.A. semifinals but did not look like the veteran team except for Ogunbowale, who was the only player in double figures at halftime with 12 points.

sport Redskins bench Mark Sanchez after poor half, pick-six Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Washington's Mark Sanchez throws early pick-six, later benched Kaleel WeatherlyYahoo SportsDecember 9, 2018, 7:00 PM GMT Mark Sanchez is known for making bad plays. And he added on to his laundry list of awful decisions early against the New York Giants, miscues that ultimately led to his benching in favor of the recently signed Josh Johnson. When Washington was up against its own goal line late in the first quarter, Sanchez attempted what looked like a short pass to give Washington some breathing room. Unfortunately for him, a defender deflected the ball, which landed in Curtis Riley’s hands for a 9-yard pick-six. Scroll to continue with content Ad TOUCHDOWN @curtis35riley!

This time, the ball ended up in Alec Ogletree’s hands for an 18-yard return. This back-breaking turnover led to a Sterling Shepard 3-yard touchdown reception. Sanchez went 6-of-14 for 38 yards, was sacked five times and had a QB rating of 10.7 before he was yanked with the Redskins trailing 40-0. Washington eventually lost, 40-16. It marked the first time Johnson played in an NFL game since 2013. He finished 11-for-16 for 195 yards and one interception, and ran and threw for touchdowns.

sport Soccer Match Set for Saudi Arabia Puts Its Organizers on the Defensive - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Soccer Match Set for Saudi Arabia Puts Its Organizers on the Defensive Supported by Soccer Match Set for Saudi Arabia Puts Its Organizers on the Defensive Image A.C. Milan and Juventus will face off in the Italian Super Cup in January, but the Italian league is drawing criticism for planning on holding the game in Saudi Arabia.CreditCreditGregorio Borgia/Associated Press By Tariq Panja Dec. 11, 2018 LONDON — The Italian Super Cup final has been played on foreign soil nine times, including once in Tripoli at the invitation of the former Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi. But the site for this season’s match is drawing a whole new level of criticism. At issue is the decision of Italian soccer authorities to forge ahead and stage the showpiece game — a matchup of the winners of the previous season’s domestic league and cup competitions — in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, next month. The match would be played just months after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and while the kingdom continues to host the largest sports piracy operation in broadcasting history. The Italian league, Serie A, has been lobbied by human rights groups, a local journalists’ union and the Qatar-based beIN Media Group — perhaps the biggest buyer of Italian soccer television rights — to remove the Jan. 16 game between Juventus and A.C. Milan from Saudi Arabia. (Juventus won both the league and the domestic cup last season, so Milan is the Super Cup opponent because it reached the cup final.) Saudi Arabia, which acquired the hosting rights in June as part of a three-match deal worth 21 million euros (about $24 million), has become one of the biggest buyers of sports properties in recent years, with investments including auto races, tennis matches and, more recently, international soccer events. It also is supporting an offer worth as much as $25 billion to acquire the rights to FIFA’s Club World Cup and to create a separate competition for national teams. The proposal has split the leaders of major governing bodies in soccer, some of whom have protested Saudi support for the piracy of multimillion-dollar rights contracts owned by Qatar’s beIN Sports. The journalists’ union for the Italian state broadcaster RAI, which will air the Super Cup in Italy, said last month that it was “absurd and unacceptable” that the game would go ahead in light of the October killing of Mr. Khashoggi, which United States intelligence officials have concluded took place on the orders of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Sports leaders have been walking a diplomatic tightrope since the killing. In October, for example, Avram Glazer, the American co-owner of the English Premier League soccer club Manchester United, was one of the many business and political leaders to pull out of a high-profile investment conference in Riyadh — though Mr. Glazer did attend another event in the country, for Prince Mohammed’s foundation, a few weeks later. Manchester United has earned millions from its relationship with Saudi Arabia through sponsorships and other agreements. Last month, the world’s top-ranked men’s tennis player, Novak Djokovic, confirmed that a scheduled exhibition match against Rafael Nadal later this month in Jidda had been postponed. Mr. Djokovic cited Mr. Nadal’s ankle injury as the reason for the cancellation, but both players had come under growing pressure to withdraw after Mr. Khashoggi’s murder. And on Dec. 8, beIN’s chief executive, Yousef Al-Obaidly, wrote a two-page letter, which was seen by The New York Times, to Serie A’s general director, Marco Brunelli, also protesting the fact that the Super Cup game would be played in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Al-Obaidly’s frustration lies with beoutQ, a piracy operation that is seemingly based in the kingdom and that was set up in the aftermath of a blockade of Qatar led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. BeoutQ continues to broadcast premium sports content — including Serie A matches — illegally, and beIN noted that it has committed about $500 million to broadcast the Italian league games. “We do not understand why Serie A has chosen to publicly reward the Saudi Arabian authorities by staging the prestigious Super Cup match in the country, and we would strongly ask you to reconsider,” Mr. Al-Obaidly wrote. Many of the league’s other rights partners have not commented on the matter, including the United States-based sports management company IMG, which last year committed €1 billion to buy Serie A’s overseas broadcasting rights for three seasons. IMG has other relationships and deals in Saudi Arabia, including as part of a partnership to organize a European Tour golf event there early next year. A spokesman for Serie A, citing confidentiality, declined to discuss what the league’s response to beIN would be or to comment on the specific issues raised by human rights groups and the journalists’ union. The auto racing series Formula E also is pressing ahead with plans to host its season-opening event in Saudi Arabia later this month. The series is partly owned by Liberty Global and Discovery Communications, which has seen a number of its Discovery channels made available in the Middle East and in parts of Europe through illegal beoutQ devices. Discovery declined to comment. “Formula E is a catalyst for change, not only with the wider automotive industry and the uptake of electric vehicles on a global scale, but also in playing a positive role in changing perceptions,” a Formula E spokesman said in an email message. “The event in Ad Diriyah is an important opportunity to showcase the power and potential of clean technologies of the future — to a country moving away from dependency on oil and demonstrating a diverse economy.” The spokesman declined to answer questions related to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record or the death of Mr. Khashoggi.

sport NFL roundup: Bears beat Rams, shake up playoff picture Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? NFL roundup: Bears beat Rams, shake up playoff picture ReutersDecember 10, 2018, 6:54 AM GMT 1 / 5 NFL: New Orleans Saints at Tampa Bay BuccaneersDec 9, 2018; Tampa, FL, USA; New Orleans Saints quarterback Taysom Hill (7) and linebacker Craig Robertson (52) celebrate after a blocked punt during the second half against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium. Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports In a marquee matchup of flashy offense against tough defense, it was all defense. The Chicago Bears held the Los Angeles Rams to 214 total yards and kept them out of the end zone Sunday night, logging a 15-6 win at Soldier Field that might play a major role in shaping the NFC playoffs when they start next month. Chicago (9-4) moved another step closer to the NFC North title. If Minnesota (6-5-1) loses on Monday night in Seattle, the Bears can wrap up the division crown next week at home against Green Bay. Scroll to continue with content Ad Los Angeles (11-2), meanwhile, sealed the NFC West last week but fell out of the No. 1 seed in the conference on Sunday. New Orleans (11-2) won earlier Sunday in Tampa Bay, and owns the top seed by virtue of a 45-35 win over the Rams on Nov. 4 in the Superdome. Dolphins 34, Patriots 33 Kenyan Drake scored to complete a two-lateral miracle final play as host Miami scored from 69 yards out and stunned New England. With seven seconds left on the clock, Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill completed a 14-yard pass to Kenny Stills, who lateraled to DeVante Parker, who then found Drake. Drake ran the final 51 yards, scooting past stumbling tight end Rob Gronkowski, whom the Patriots had inserted into the game to stop a "Hail Mary" pass. Tannehill finished 14-of-19 passing for 265 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. He battled a sore ankle after he got stepped on in the second quarter, but returned and kept the Dolphins (7-6) in playoff contention with the win. New England (9-4) had a chance to clinch its division for the 10th straight year but instead lost for the fifth time in its last six trips to Miami. Chiefs 27, Ravens 24 (OT) Story continues Quarterback Patrick Mahomes converted two fourth downs on a game-tying drive in regulation and kicker Harrison Butker atoned for a missed field goal with a 35-yarder in overtime as host Kansas City edged Baltimore. Mahomes finished with 377 yards passing, going 35 of 53 with two touchdowns and an interception against the NFL's top-ranked defense. With the win, the Chiefs (11-2) clinched a berth in the playoffs while retaining the best record in the AFC. Starting quarterback Lamar Jackson was injured in overtime after getting sacked by Kansas City linebackers Justin Houston and Dee Ford. Faced with two snaps and 22 yards to gain from the Baltimore 41-yard line, backup quarterback Robert Griffin III could not engineer a first down, throwing two incompletions as the Ravens fell to 7-6. Saints 28, Buccaneers 14 Special teams ace Taysom Hill flipped the momentum with a blocked punt and Drew Brees converted second-half touchdowns with a short pass and a fourth-down leap to lift New Orleans to a comeback victory over host Tampa Bay and claim the Saints' second consecutive NFC South title. The Saints (11-2), who won back-to-back division titles for the first time in franchise history, looked sluggish, falling behind 14-3 at halftime, but they scored 25 unanswered points with three second-half touchdown drives and a 36-yard field goal by Will Lutz to put the game away. The Bucs (5-8) dominated the Saints in the first half, taking a 14-3 lead, and it could have been even more lopsided because kicker Cairo Santos missed a 46-yard field goal after Tampa Bay had driven to a first-and-10 at the New Orleans 22. Chargers 26, Bengals 21 Darius Philon's sack on a two-point conversion attempt with less than two minutes remaining sealed Los Angles' victory over visiting Cincinnati and helped to solidify the Chargers' playoff chances. The Chargers (10-3), the top wild-card team in the AFC, remain behind the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West standings. The Chargers and Chiefs are set for a showdown at Kansas City on Thursday night. Bengals quarterback Jeff Driskel was 18 of 27 for 170 yards and a touchdown in his second career start as Cincinnati (5-8) lost its fifth consecutive game and dropped to 5-8 after opening the season with a 4-1 record. Cowboys 29, Eagles 23 (OT) Quarterback Dak Prescott threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper with 1:55 remaining in overtime to lift Dallas past visiting Philadelphia. The pass was deflected by Rasul Douglas and into Cooper's hands before he raced in for the winning score and the fifth straight win for the Cowboys, who never let the Eagles touch the ball in overtime. Prescott was 42 of 54 for a career-high 455 yards, two interceptions and three touchdowns, all to Cooper, who caught 10 passes for 217 yards. The Cowboys improved to 8-5, two games ahead of the Eagles (6-7) and Washington Redskins (6-7) in the NFC East with three games to play. Packers 34, Falcons 20 Aaron Rodgers broke Tom Brady's NFL record for most consecutive passes without an interception in style, setting the mark on a 24-yard touchdown pass to Randall Cobb that helped Green Bay beat visiting Atlanta. The pass was Rodgers' 359th in a row without an interception dating to Week 4 of this season, a twice-deflected pass against Buffalo. Brady went 358 passes without an interception during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. Rodgers' record-setting play, in the midst of an otherwise subpar season by his historic standards, came in the third quarter to give Green Bay a 27-7 lead. The outcome made a winner of interim coach Joe Philbin, who replaced Mike McCarthy after the Packers (5-7-1) fired the 13th-year head coach shortly after last week's loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Falcons (4-9) lost their fifth in a row. Raiders 24, Steelers 21 Derek Carr hit Derek Carrier for a 6-yard touchdown pass on fourth-and-goal with 21 seconds remaining to give host Oakland an upset of Pittsburgh. In a seesaw game, Carr was 5 of 7 for 74 yards on the winning drive. For the game, he threw for 322 yards and also had a scoring pass to Lee Smith. Doug Martin ran for a touchdown for the Raiders (3-10). Chris Boswell slipped and shanked a 40-yard field-goal attempt as time expired, leaving Pittsburgh (7-5-1) with a three-game losing streak. Ben Roethlisberger missed most of the second half, apparently injured on a second-quarter sack, but returned to lead the Steelers to a go-ahead score with 2:55 remaining. Browns 26, Panthers 20 Jarvis Landry scored two touchdowns and set up another as Cleveland handed visiting Carolina its fifth straight defeat. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield completed 18 of 22 throws for 238 yards and one touchdown as Cleveland (5-7-1) won for the third time in four games. The Panthers (6-7) are now eliminated from NFC South title contention even though two of their three remaining games come against the first-place New Orleans Saints. Christian McCaffrey scored two rushing touchdowns for the Panthers, who are 1-6 in road games. Colts 24, Texans 21 Andrew Luck threw for 399 yards and two touchdowns as Indianapolis snapped host Houston's nine-game winning streak with a win at NRG Stadium. Luck completed 27 of 41 passes for Indianapolis (7-6), which bounced back from a 6-0 upset loss last week at Jacksonville. He found wide receiver T.Y. Hilton, who had been a game-time decision with a shoulder injury, nine times for 199 yards. Deshaun Watson hit on 27 of 38 passes for 267 yards for the Texans, who dropped to 9-4 but still lead the AFC South by two games over the Colts and Tennessee with three games remaining. Giants 40, Redskins 16 Rookie Saquon Barkley rushed for a career-high 170 yards, Eli Manning threw three touchdown passes and visiting New York routed Washington. Manning and Barkley both left after three quarters with the score 40-0. Barkley, who carried the ball 14 times, reeled off a 78-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Manning completed 14 of 22 passes for 197 yards and no interceptions for the Giants (5-8), who have won four of five. In his first start for Washington (6-7) in place of Colt McCoy, quarterback Mark Sanchez completed 6 of 14 passes for 38 yards and two interceptions. He was sacked five times before being replaced by Josh Johnson in the third quarter. 49ers 20, Broncos 14 George Kittle caught an 85-yard touchdown pass on a record-setting day to help San Francisco build a big lead en route to a win against Denver in Santa Clara, Calif. Kittle caught seven passes for 210 yards, an all-time record for a 49ers tight end, helping San Francisco (3-10) snap a three-game losing streak while handing the Broncos (6-7) a critical setback in their pursuit of a playoff spot in the AFC. Phillip Lindsay was held to 30 yards rushing on 14 carries, but did manage a 1-yard touchdown run for the Broncos, who fell a game behind Baltimore, Indianapolis, Tennessee and Miami in the chase for the final playoff berth in the AFC with just three games to play. Jets 27, Bills 23 Sam Darnold threw for 170 yards and a touchdown and Elijah McGuire scored on fourth-and-goal from the 1 with 1:17 remaining as visiting New York came back to beat Buffalo. Darnold returned after missing three games with a foot injury to win the duel with fellow rookie quarterback Josh Allen and snap the Jets' six-game losing streak and lift them to 4-9. It was the first meeting between Darnold, the third-overall selection in the 2018 draft, and No. 7 pick Allen. Both quarterbacks were inactive for Buffalo's 41-10 win at New York in Week 10. Allen ran for 101 yards and a touchdown for the Bills (4-9). He was 18 of 36 passing for 206 yards with two interceptions and continued to power the Buffalo offense with his legs. Lions 17, Cardinals 3 Matthew Stafford completed 15 of 23 passes for 101 yards to lead visiting Detroit to a win in Glendale, Ariz., in a matchup of two struggling teams. Arizona (3-10) shares the worst record in the NFL with the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders with three games to play as teams look ahead to 2019 and what assets they can get in next spring's draft. Arizona entered last in the league in scoring offense behind a patchwork offensive line, while the Lions (5-8) were 23rd. --Field Level Media What to Read Next Back Sign in Sports Home Fantasy NFL NBA MLB NHL NCAAF Soccer Golf NCAAB MMA World Cup Boxing NASCAR Tennis WNBA NCAAW Olympics Indycar Horse Racing Cycling Odds Videos Podcasts Rivals Shop Help Jobs Yahoo Sites Home Mail Search News Finance Entertainment Lifestyle Sports Fantasy Sports Weather Tech Shopping Answers Tumblr Tools Help Account Info Careers About Terms (Updated) & Privacy (Updated)
sport The Impact of the Hong Kong International Races - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Horse Racing Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Horse Racing|The Impact of the Hong Kong International Races Supported by The Impact of the Hong Kong International Races Image Sha Tin Racecourse during last year’s Hong Kong International Races. This year’s races will take place on Sunday.CreditCreditIsaac Lawrence/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Amanda Duckworth Dec. 7, 2018 Although it has one of the smallest horse populations in the world, Hong Kong has positioned itself as global leader in thoroughbred racing. The Hong Kong International Races, or H.K.I.R., the marquee event of the island’s season, take place on Sunday at Sha Tin Racecourse. Begun in 1988, the event originally featured one race, the Hong Kong Invitation Cup, which was the first international race held there. Now simply named the Hong Kong Cup, the race has been joined by the Hong Kong Sprint, Mile and Vase, and they are worth 93 million Hong Kong dollars ($11.9 million) in total. More than 1,300 runners from 17 countries and regions have taken part since the races were created. Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s chief executive, discussed the success of the races as well as Hong Kong’s racing model. The conversation has been edited and condensed. How important are the Hong Kong International Races to the program? One of the cornerstones in developing Hong Kong racing to a world-class level was the introduction of the Hong Kong International Races. If you look back, our betting turnover was very high, and we had some good horses, but there was nothing, be it horses or races, of world-class quality. We wanted to strive for this level of excellence. Now, people appreciate how competitive Hong Kong racing is, how good it is and how much quality it has, and we can reap in the rewards, be it through sponsorship, brand recognition or commingling. How does the jockey club recruit international runners to compete? One reason is the very attractive prize money. The Sprint, the Mile and the Cup are the richest races at their distance on the world calendar. Also, if you look at our quarantine, it is probably one of the easiest places to fly into. When you talk to horsemen, in a lot of other jurisdictions it’s a little bit more difficult. The other thing is people know if they come to Hong Kong, they absolutely compete on a level playing field. Integrity in everything we do is key. Additionally, we have teams in different countries who try to convince owners and trainers to focus on our races. What value do international competitors bring to the races? I humbly say we have the most international racing product on a day-to-day basis, if you look at the horses, trainers and jockeys, but the H.K.I.R. is another spike. It’s a benefit not only for Hong Kong, but global racing. We are able to bring together those who are the best in Hong Kong and in the world. Jockeys, trainers and owners all strive to be at an event that is unique, and Hong Kong is a unique platform. I think the next stage of the H.K.I.R. is how we create not only prize money value for the owners, but how we create breeding value for winning horses. For example, Lord Kanaloa won twice at the H.K.I.R. The international profile he got in Hong Kong enhanced his stallion value in Japan. Now, you see his daughter Almond Eye dominating. To what do you attribute Hong Kong’s global success? We only have around 0.7 percent of the world’s horse population, but around 8 percent of the best horses are trained here, and we have around 8 to 10 percent of the best races in the world run here. We started with prize money, but we also wanted to increase the quality of horses. Image Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, in red tie, chief executive of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, distributed money in red envelopes at Sha Tin Racecourse on Chinese New Year Race Day in February. The Hong Kong International Races are at Sha Tin on Sunday.CreditGetty Images We also have a clear, strategic focus on turf. If you only have 1,200 horses, you can’t be good at all surfaces and all distances. Additionally, our racing authority has a very strong focus on integrity. There is no room for racing or training under the influence of prohibited substances. We also have one of the best teams in the world to administer and run racing. Why do you make so much free data available to fans and bettors? Our customers see racing as a mind game, and they need information. We make this freely available and in different presentation forms because different generations have different ways of how they process information. All the horses are trained in our premises, so training data, veterinary data, everything we have, we make available for our customers. Every race meeting, we have around 800,000 to 900,000 people searching for information on our website, and a lot of them spend three or four hours in this mind-game exercise. People have a gaming propensity, so we provide the information which we think is relevant to them and attractive to them, so they engage with our game. Is owning racehorses popular in Hong Kong? Horse ownership is extremely prestigious here. We have more people who want to have a horse than can have a horse. Every year, we can bring in 350 to 400 horses, but we have 1,200 to 1,300 applications for a horse. We did introduce a special replacement permit where you don’t have to go through the normal process. If you retire a horse and you bring in a horse of at least Group 3 quality, you can do this at any time. We have driven the quality up. Hong Kong is unique in that it has no breeding program, so how do you recruit and care for racehorses? It’s a huge education exercise with owners about what types of horses fit our program. The other thing we look at is equine welfare. We have a very stringent vet protocol. We provide owners with veterinary information before they bring in a horse, and also if you want to own a horse you have to pay 80,000 Hong Kong dollars, soon to be 90,000, into a retirement fund. We stress from the import of the horse that you as the owner are responsible. Why does Hong Kong allow owners to change a horse’s name, when many jurisdictions do not? A lot of it has to do with luck, and sometimes you have names which are very difficult to pronounce for the Chinese. Changing a horse’s name is, from a traceability standpoint, a bit of an issue. But as long as they are geldings, the impact is not as much. A lot of times, owners want their horses’ names to relate to each other. We have families that always include a certain word, like Beauty or Dragon. I think it will become more of an issue, but at the moment there is a very strong expression from our owners to be able to rename their horses. Racehorses have been trained exclusively at Sha Tin, but with Conghua Racecourse opening this year in mainland China, how has it changed things? I think this was one of the boldest projects we have ever done. We established the first disease-free zone in China. There’s a corridor between Hong Kong and this training center where the horses can move freely back and forth. We could not get more land in Hong Kong, so we could not expand here. Conghua gives us the opportunity to increase the horse population. Sha Tin will always be the center, but it gives us the next stage of development.

Liverpool Allows Itself to Smile and Its Fans to Believe Image Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino after scoring his third goal and the team’s fifth on a penalty kick Saturday. Mohamed Salah had drawn the penalty but yielded to his teammate.CreditCreditPhil Noble/Reuters By Rory Smith Dec. 29, 2018 LIVERPOOL, England — Jordan Henderson had just sent a shot, wild and high and a little comical, soaring into orbit above Arsenal’s crossbar. The ball landed somewhere in the upper rows of the Kop, its arrival greeted with a teasing cheer. Henderson turned, apologized to his teammates and jogged back into position. As he did so, Liverpool’s fans serenaded the ball back down to earth, asking — in less than gentle terms — what, exactly, their captain had been intending to do. Henderson paused, turned toward them and lifted his arms in the air, as if in triumph. He beamed a wide smile. The crowd laughed at him, with him. The situation allowed for a little levity. Liverpool was leading, 5-1, with just a few minutes left to play; everyone involved had, for some time, been going through the motions, conserving energy, watching the clock. A ninth successive Premier League win was secure. Liverpool’s unbeaten start to the season would go on. Tottenham Hotspur’s defeat at home to Wolves a few hours previously meant that Jürgen Klopp’s team would have a 9-point lead at the top of the table, for 24 hours, at least; by that stage, Anfield was feeling lighthearted, lightheaded. It was not an isolated moment, though. Little flourishes of exuberance embellished Liverpool’s performance. Roberto Firmino played no-look passes in the buildup to the host’s first and fourth goals. Mohamed Salah gave Firmino what Klopp described as “a Christmas present, one of the nicest things I have ever seen,” in allowing him to take the penalty that brought Liverpool’s fifth goal of the game, and the Brazilian’s third, the first hat trick of his career. Image Liverpool Manager Jürgen Klopp, left, celebrated with Xherdan Shaqiri after beating Arsenal at Anfield on Saturday in the English Premier League.CreditPeter Byrne/Press Association, via Associated Press Adam Lallana’s first touch, after he appeared as a second-half substitute, was to pull off a Cruyff turn, under pressure, not far from his own penalty area. Nathaniel Clyne, a defender hardly known for his exemplary technique, contributed a lavish drag-back move late on. Whether Liverpool overindulged its showmanship or not, none of this should be confused for a lack of seriousness: Klopp’s team was in such a sufficiently competitive mood that as the players left the field for halftime, there was some sort of contretemps in the tunnel. They knew what this game and this win meant; they know what each game and each win means. For all Klopp insists that it does not matter how much of a lead Liverpool establishes over its competitors — and particularly, in truth, Manchester City, its next opponent — and for all his avowals that nobody in Liverpool’s changing room so much as smiled at the news that second-place Tottenham had lost, neither manager nor players exist in a bubble. They know that the destiny of the Premier League title — for now — rests in their hands. They know how much this club yearns to end its 29-year wait to be called champion of England. They know that the fans long for a 19th championship, and they know that a season that started with hope that this might finally be the time has now become one infused with something that feels a lot more like belief. They know all that, and yet watching them against a team theoretically regarded as among their peers, they seemed not to know any of it at all. They did not look like a team rather unexpectedly leading a title race. They did not look like a team aware that City might seize upon the slightest slip, that the pace all three contenders have set this season is so fierce that a draw counts as a defeat, a defeat equates to disaster. They did not look like a team with the dreams of millions resting on their shoulders. Instead, they looked, frankly, as if they were enjoying themselves. Liverpool has been here before, in the long, barren years since 1990, when it last claimed the championship. In 1996-97, Roy Evans’s team was on top, too; a decade ago, so was Rafa Benítez’s; in the 2013-14 season, Brendan Rodgers’s side acted as the pacesetter. All of them surrendered their leads. None of them won the title. Image The referee Michael Oliver, left, was pursued by Arsenal’s Shkodran Mustafi, center, and Sokratis Papastathopoulos after Oliver awarded a penalty to Liverpool.CreditRui Vieira/Associated Press There are no guarantees yet, of course, that Klopp’s team will be different. He described the challenge facing Liverpool as a “marathon” after the game, though it is, perhaps, really more of a steeplechase. There are still 18 obstacles, hazards and traps Liverpool must navigate, all of them at breakneck speed. That this feels different, though, is undeniable. All of those Liverpool teams that have been close before seemed to exist on the edge. Evans assembled a side that was wonderful in attack but fragile on defense. Benítez mounted a title challenge while, behind the scenes, the club collapsed into internecine warfare; he did so, largely, because of the ability of Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres to transcend the chaos. Rodgers, then, took a little from Column A and a little from Column B. In Luis Suárez, he had the most loathed player in England and probably, that year, the best striker in the world. It was also a team that could — to borrow a phrase from Domènec Torrent, formerly an assistant to Pep Guardiola and now coach of New York City F.C. — “kill you in 15 minutes, or itself in 10.” In the end, every time, Liverpool bent and crumpled and wilted under the pressure. The team, or the club, was too flawed to cope with the exigencies of a title challenge. They needed everything to go right for them to succeed. They were not equipped to handle adversity. Plenty has gone right for Liverpool so far this season: most significantly, of course, the freak, 96th-minute goal from the otherwise forgotten Divock Origi that won the Merseyside derby on Dec. 2, the strike that kept City within touching distance just as Guardiola’s team threatened to streak away. But that, too, is not an isolated moment: Liverpool’s first here — Salah’s blocked shot bobbling off him, two Arsenal defenders and right into the path of Firmino, in front of the goal, roughly three minutes after Arsenal had taken the lead — was the latest in what is already a healthy list. Image Mohamed Salah scored Liverpool’s fourth goal on a penalty kick.CreditPhil Noble/Reuters There is no sense, though, that Liverpool needs those bursts of good fortune. Klopp has the meanest defense in the country — with just eight goals conceded in 20 games — and a variety in attack that all of his predecessors would envy. If Salah struggles, Firmino steps in. If he fails, Sadio Mane can pick up the slack. If none of that works, Xherdan Shaqiri, who was picked up for 13 million pounds, or about $16.5 million, from relegated Stoke City last summer, is thrown in. This Liverpool is not reliant on one player, or one partnership. There is a unity of purpose on the field, behind the scenes, and an exultant mood among the fans. Liverpool is regularly accused by opponents’ supporters of hubris, of habitually leaping to conclusions too early, too eagerly. Perhaps in years gone by, that has been the case. As Klopp pointed out, though, it would be crazy if the fans were not reveling in the season their club is having. It is easily forgotten, amid all the hyperbole and artifice and tailored tension that surround the Premier League, but the whole purpose of the enterprise is for people to have fun. If it is in some way unbecoming to enjoy being on top of the table, it is hard to know what the point is. The one question — the one that will define how long that jubilation lasts, and what it all leads to — is whether that can be maintained. Klopp, his players, their fans: They are all enjoying themselves for now. But things buckle under pressure, and melt in heat. Liverpool will face an abundance of both. The history, the longing, dictates that they must deal with more than City, more than Tottenham — in the months to come. For all the strengths Klopp has assembled, for Liverpool, this is now a test of nerve as much as talent. As his players left the field Saturday, the Liverpool manager, usually the fire-starter, the hype man, motioned to them to keep their calm, not to get carried away. There is a time to lift your arms in triumph, to smile, to laugh. It is in May. Correction:  An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the most recent Merseyside derby.

sport Baker Mayfield is a different quarterback since Hue Jackson was fired Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Baker Mayfield is a different quarterback since Hue Jackson was fired ProFootball Talk on NBC SportsDecember 10, 2018, 6:02 PM GMT Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield was struggling through his rookie season until head coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley were fired. Since then, Mayfield hasn’t struggled a bit. Mayfield is one of the best quarterbacks in football in the five games since Gregg Williams took over as head coach and Freddie Kitchens took over as offensive coordinator, something no one would have called Mayfield when he was playing in the Jackson/Haley offense. Scroll to continue with content Ad With Jackson and Haley running the offense, Mayfield completed 58.3 percent of his passes, averaged 6.6 yards per pass, had eight touchdowns and six interceptions, had a 78.9 passer rating and was sacked 20 times. Since Jackson and Haley were fired, Mayfield has completed 73.2 percent of his passes, averaged 9.2 yards per pass, thrown 11 touchdown passes and four interceptions, has a 114.5 passer rating, and has been sacked three times. It’s hard to look at those stats and come to any conclusion other than Jackson and Haley were holding back Mayfield’s development. But the most important statistic is this one: In 40 games with Jackson as their head coach, the Browns had three wins. In five games since firing Jackson, the Browns have three wins.

sport Army Beats Navy Again, Putting Yet More Bounce in Its Step - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Army Beats Navy Again, Putting Yet More Bounce in Its Step Supported by College football roundup Army Beats Navy Again, Putting Yet More Bounce in Its Step Image Army quarterback Kelvin Hopkins Jr. rushing for a touchdown against Navy in the first quarter on Saturday in Philadelphia. He clinched the win with a score in the fourth.CreditCreditBill Streicher/USA Today Sports, via Reuters By The Associated Press Dec. 8, 2018 Army Coach Jeff Monken hopped on top of a wall and pumped his fist toward stoked cadets who were set to belt out the alma mater. He brought the party to the locker room and waved an Army football flag as the Black Knights bounced around him. Army ditched its mundane routines and cut loose like a bunch of rowdy civilians on Saturday. And why not? The setting was right after Army had beaten Navy for a third straight time, this time in front of a packed house and the president at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. “I don’t ever want our guys to stop celebrating,” Monken said. “I promise you, I’ll be celebrating every year if we win this thing because I know how hard it is.” Monken returned a program that routinely suffered annual losses to the Midshipmen into a bowl-bound team that can keep the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy at West Point. The No. 22 Black Knights recovered two fumbles in the fourth quarter and Kelvin Hopkins Jr. had two rushing touchdowns as Army beat Navy, 17-10. President Trump attended the 119th game between the rivals and flipped the coin before spending a half on each side. No matter his view, Army (10-2) always had the edge. Army retained the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy — awarded to the team with the best record in games among the three service academies — after winning it for the first time in 22 years last season and snuffed a late rally by Navy (3-10). Image Quarterback Zach Abey taking a high snap, reflecting the struggles of the Navy offense through most of the game. Abey went 0 for 4 with two interceptions before being replaced in the fourth quarter.CreditElsa/Getty Images With Navy behind by 10-7, quarterback Zach Abey lost a fumble on fourth-and-12 deep in his team’s territory. Hopkins scored on a 1-yard run, making it 17-7 and giving Army the cushion it needed to win in front of an announced crowd of 66,729. Army players hopped and waved hands in celebration during a replay timeout and got the cadets in the stands to bounce along. They had good reason to celebrate: Army has regained its footing in a rivalry in which Navy had a series-best 14-game winning streak from 2002 to 2015. Army trails over all, 60-52-7. “It’s been hard on all of us: our players, our coaches, our staff, our school,” Navy Coach Ken Niumatalolo said. “We like to win. We’ve been winning a lot of games.” Trump sat on the Army side during the first half and crossed the field to the Navy side at halftime. He officiated the coin toss and was introduced by the public-address announcer Dan Baker to a cheering crowd. Navy called “tails,” and that was what it was when the flipped coin landed on the turf. Navy elected to kick off. That was a mistake. Kell Walker ran 51 yards to the 10 on the fourth play from scrimmage, and Hopkins dashed in for the touchdown on the next play for a 7-0 lead. In a series steeped in traditions — the “March On” and drumline battles among them — perhaps none is more ingrained than the running game. Last year’s game had a combined three pass attempts, and quarterbacks for each team are usually the leading rushers. But Army and Navy tried to throw more often this time, with mixed results. Army safety Jaylon McClinton had an interception in the first half. Army also dropped a key third-down pass that led to John Abercrombie’s missed 33-yard field-goal attempt in the second quarter. Abercrombie rebounded and kicked a 33-yarder in the third for a 10-0 lead. Last season’s game was an instant classic: Bennett Moehring narrowly missed a 48-yard try in the snow on the final play and Army held off Navy, 14-13. On Saturday, Moehring made the extra point after a 1-yard scoring run by the backup quarterback Garret Lewis that pulled Navy to 10-7 with 7 minutes 10 seconds left, and he kicked a 45-yard field goal with 29 seconds to play. Lewis’s score was set up by Malcom Perry’s 43-yard run to the 5. Image Navy midshipmen taunting Army cadets leaving the field before the game.CreditSarah Stier/Getty Images There were reminders all around the stadium that this was no ordinary game. The Navy Leap Frogs parachute team drew a roar from the crowd with each safe landing on the field. Bill the Goat, Navy’s mascot, was safely leashed and secured against a possible abduction attempt by cadets. And each side safely returned “captives” in the “prisoner exchange,” in which seven midshipmen and seven cadets swap service academies for a semester. The Army prisoners spelled out “3-PEAT” on the backs of their uniforms. After the game, Trump posted on Twitter: “It was my honor to attend today’s #ArmyNavyGame in Philadelphia. A GREAT game played all around by our HEROES. Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football on the win!” N.D.

sport Winter meetings: Bryce Harper to the Yankees sounds far less likely Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? It sure sounds like the Yankees aren't interested in Bryce Harper Mark TownsendYahoo SportsDecember 10, 2018, 11:43 PM GMT Those seemingly inevitable Bryce Harper to the New York Yankees rumors we’ve been waiting for this offseason? They haven’t come yet. And if we’re to believe Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, they might not come at all. Speaking to media at the winter meetings in Las Vegas on Monday, Cashman sounded like an executive whose team has almost no interest in baseball’s top free agent. Scroll to continue with content Ad Asked about Bryce Harper, Brian Cashman rattled off the names of his six outfielders and said there’s no spot. Reiterated that playing Harper at first base isn’t an option for the Yankees. — Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) December 10, 2018 Let’s be honest, if the Yankees wanted Harper bad enough, they would find a way to make room for him. Should we buy the Yankees’ lack of interest? At this point, we probably should. They stayed true to not breaking the bank for top free-agent pitcher Patrick Corbin, instead letting him take a bigger money deal with the Washington Nationals. Six-time All-Stars who are only entering their age-26 season are pretty much once-in-a-lifetime players. When elite level players become available, we’ve grown accustomed to the Yankees being first in line. But apparently not these Yankees. If they’re giving reasons for not pursuing Harper instead of going all out to sign him, then he’s clearly not a priority. What are the Yankees priorities? Adding another top level starting pitcher to go along with Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka, CC Sabathia and the recently acquired James Paxton seems to be Cashman’s primary focus.  Story continues There’s also a free agent named Manny Machado, who many believe could provide equal or even greater value than Harper depending on the money involved. He would certainly be a better fit for New York in the short term with shortstop Didi Gregorius expected to be rehabbing his injured elbow until June. Of course, any commitment to Harper or Machado will be a very long term commitment, and a guy like Machado might be easier to build around.  How will the cards fall for Bryce Harper if the Yankees aren’t a big part of the bidding? (AP) Where does Bryce Harper’s market stand? The Washington Nationals feel like they’re out of the running to retain Harper. Between that news and the Yankees assumed lack of interest, the focus is squarely on three teams: The Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers and emerging dark horse Chicago White Sox. Philadelphia says it is prepared to spend “stupid” money, while the Dodgers just spend money period. The White Sox, well, that would be quite a story. Their rebuild is progressing well. Adding Harper would give them an elite producer to help push that rebuild over the top. Not to mention he’d help bring fans back to Guaranteed Rate Field. It doesn’t feel like a decision is near for Harper.  When that time does come, it’s possible the landscape will have changed enough for the Yankees or anyone else to get involved. For now though, Harper and the Yankees aren’t looking like a match.

sport Breaking Down the New Players on This Year’s Baseball Hall of Fame Ballot - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Baseball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Baseball|Breaking Down the New Players on This Year’s Baseball Hall of Fame Ballot Supported by On Baseball Breaking Down the New Players on This Year’s Baseball Hall of Fame Ballot Image Mariano Rivera pitching in Game 6 of the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. It was the fifth world championship he won with the Yankees.CreditCreditBarton Silverman/The New York Times By Tyler Kepner Nov. 19, 2018 This year’s Hall of Fame ballot, announced Monday and mailed to voters this week, is tinged with sadness. One of the top new candidates, Roy Halladay, died last November when a small plane he was piloting plunged into the Gulf of Mexico near his home in Florida. He was 40. Halladay, a two-time Cy Young Award winner with a perfect game and a playoff no-hitter, could be the first player elected posthumously by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America since Roberto Clemente in 1973. Among the other newcomers on the ballot, Mariano Rivera is a lock to be elected. Rivera helped the Yankees win five World Series titles while collecting a record 652 saves and compiling a 2.21 earned run average, the best of any pitcher born after 1889 with at least 1,000 innings. Rivera could have company on the stage next summer in Cooperstown, N.Y. Five holdover candidates received votes on more than half of the ballots last year, with 75 percent needed for election: Edgar Martinez (70.4 percent), Mike Mussina (63.5), Roger Clemens (57.3), Barry Bonds (56.4) and Curt Schilling (51.2). Besides those five and other holdovers, voters will have 18 newcomers besides Halladay and Rivera to consider. Most will fail to meet the 5 percent threshold needed to remain on the ballot next year, but before they do, here’s a quick reflection or fun fact on each of the other 18. RICK ANKIEL When Ankiel suddenly lost his ability to throw strikes, in the top of the third inning of the opening game of the 2000 playoffs, Steve Blass watched at home and winced. “Why at the beginning?” Blass said, according to Ankiel’s memoir with Tim Brown. “Why now?” Blass, at least, had been a star for Pittsburgh into his 30s before he lost control. Ankiel, then with St. Louis, was only 21, and effectively finished as a pitcher. He fashioned a second act as an outfielder and logged a hard-earned 11 seasons in the majors. Image Jason Bay played six strong season with the Pittsburgh Pirates before playing with the Red Sox and Mets.CreditBarton Silverman/The New York Times JASON BAY Early in his career, Bay was traded three times in 17 months. When he finally got a chance to start every day at age 25, with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2004, he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award. Bay was terrific for six seasons, averaging 30 homers and 99 runs batted in, and after a brief stop in Boston he signed a four-year, $66 million deal with the Mets, sustained two concussions and was never the same. LANCE BERKMAN I once asked Berkman about the game-tying single he hit off the Texas Rangers’ Scott Feldman in the 10th inning of Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals were one strike from elimination. “It was actually a really good pitch,” Berkman said. “He threw it, I think, right where he wanted to throw it. It was a cutter in, started right on the corner, probably just a hair off the inside corner. He didn’t make a bad pitch. He made all very competitive pitches. It’s just something you can’t really account for. I didn’t hit it all that great, but it found some grass.” Found some grass. I love that. FREDDY GARCIA A distinct line connects four of the best pitchers in Seattle Mariners history. Mark Langston starred in the 1980s and was traded to Montreal for Randy Johnson. Johnson starred in the 1990s and was traded to Houston for Garcia, who is from Venezuela and threw changeups. Garcia inspired a young pitcher in Venezuela, Felix Hernandez, to learn the changeup and root for the Mariners. Hernandez signed with Seattle at age 16, wore Garcia’s No. 34 and used a devastating changeup to become the Mariners’ career wins leader. Garcia is fourth on that list with 76 victories; he won 80 more times for six other teams. JON GARLAND Garland went 18-10 for the 2005 White Sox, a World Series champion that might as well have played in the 19th century. In the regular season, four Chicago starters combined for more than 890 innings. In the five-game American League Championship Series, the White Sox got 133 of 135 outs from their rotation. In the five games of this year’s A.L.C.S., Boston Red Sox starters got 74 of 135. Image The Yankees dugout congratulating Travis Hafner after he hit a two-run homer in a 2013 game against the Cleveland Indians.CreditBarton Silverman/The New York Times TRAVIS HAFNER Five players on this ballot — Hafner, Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Vernon Wells and Kevin Youkilis — played their final games with the Yankees in 2013, a season marked by Derek Jeter hobbling around on a broken ankle and Alex Rodriguez lying about steroids. Hafner hit the final dozen of his 213 career home runs, the most by any player born in North Dakota. (Fargo’s Roger Maris hit more, but he was actually born in Minnesota.) TODD HELTON We all know that Jeter, picked sixth over all, was the best player taken in the 1992 draft. But who was the next-best player? By wins above replacement, it was Helton, who was taken 55th over all by San Diego out of high school but attended the University of Tennessee instead. Helton stayed three years in Knoxville, hitting .370 for the Volunteers while moonlighting as a pitcher (19-5, 2.24 E.R.A.) and quarterback (484 yards, four touchdowns — and one knee injury that opened a starting spot for Peyton Manning). The Colorado Rockies made Helton their first-round choice in 1995, and he played with them for all of his 2,247 career games — exactly 1,000 more than anyone else in franchise history. TED LILLY We’ve had a good run of former Montreal Expos in Cooperstown lately, with Gary Carter, Andre Dawson, Tim Raines and Vladimir Guerrero going in since 2003. But the candidates Youppi! once cheered are dwindling, and Lilly is the only one on this ballot. He made his debut in 1999 for the Expos, who soon traded him to the Yankees for Hideki Irabu. But the Yankees blundered by dealing Lilly to Oakland in 2002 in a three-way deal with Detroit for Jeff Weaver. Lilly had eight career victories before the trade, 122 thereafter.

He made it again as a starter in 2002, the year he threw a no-hitter. He was 0-3 in the 2003 postseason but 3-0 the next fall, winning the clinching games in the division series, A.L.C.S. and World Series. The Red Sox let him go after that, but Lowe remained a solid starter for years, helping the Dodgers and the Braves reach the playoffs. DARREN OLIVER On March 25, 2005, Oliver was pitching for the Rockies in an exhibition game in Tucson when a pack of bees descended on the mound in the fifth inning. The bees chased Oliver away, and while he tried several times to keep pitching, the swarm would not let him. The game was called before the top of the sixth, and afterward, Oliver said that the bees had been attracted to the coconut oil in his hair gel. “I guess I must have smelled good,” he said. “It was kind of funny at first, but after a while, I started getting a little nervous.” On that day, at least, the bees did what Father Time struggled to do: remove Oliver from the mound. The well-traveled left-hander toiled for 20 major league seasons. ROY OSWALT The Houston Astros issued No. 44 to Oswalt for spring training in 2001. It wasn’t his first choice, but he was a rookie and knew his place. “I wore 18 in high school,” Oswalt said recently, “but Moises Alou had it, and I knew I wasn’t getting it.” When Oswalt went 14-3 that season, he decided that 44 worked just fine and kept it his entire career, which included 143 victories for the Astros, one shy of Joe Niekro’s franchise record. No. 44 is usually associated with sluggers — think Hank Aaron, Reggie Jackson and Willie McCovey — but Oswalt is the best pitcher ever to wear it. Image Andy Pettite pitching against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium in 2007.CreditSuzy Allman for The New York Times ANDY PETTITTE In this era of diminishing workloads for starters — especially in October — it’s heartening to see Pettitte’s name in the top 10 on the career list for innings pitched in the World Series. Pettitte threw 77⅔ innings, eighth behind six Hall of Famers and Art Nehf, a 1920s standout for the New York Giants. Pettitte was 5-4 with a 4.06 E.R.A. in the World Series, starting two openers, winning two clinchers and losing another. His best performance came in a 6-1 victory over the Marlins in Game 2 in 2003, when Aaron Boone made an error with two outs in the ninth inning to cost him a complete-game shutout. JUAN PIERRE Here was a career of extremes. Pierre had no arm, no power and very little plate discipline. But the things he did well, he did really well. He was durable (five consecutive seasons of 162 games). He was fast (614 stolen bases, ranking 10th in the integration era). He could bunt (he’s the last nonpitcher with 20 sacrifice hits in a season). And he was an extreme contact hitter (an average of 39 strikeouts a season). Bonus fun fact: Pierre was named for his father’s favorite player, the Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal. PLACIDO POLANCO The Detroit Tigers were down to their final out in the 2006 World Series when Polanco came up against the Cardinals’ Adam Wainwright. Polanco represented the tying run, but in 18 plate appearances in that World Series, he had reached base just once, with a hit-by-pitch. Somewhat miraculously, Polanco drew a walk to save himself the ignominy of making the final out. Even so, Polanco’s 17 at-bats without a hit are the most by any player in a World Series in the last 50 seasons, an odd distinction for a player with a strong career average of .297. MIGUEL TEJADA Only two players since 1937 have reached all of these benchmarks in the same season: 200 hits, 100 runs, 30 homers, 150 runs batted in. One was Albert Belle for the White Sox in 1998. The other was Tejada for the Baltimore Orioles in 2004. That scintillating season earned Tejada zero first-place votes for the M.V.P. award, though he did win it for Oakland in 2002 — the season chronicled in “Moneyball,” the groundbreaking book that, alas, dismisses Tejada for not walking very much. VERNON WELLS Wells spent most of his career with also-ran teams in Toronto, appearing in 1,731 overall games without reaching the postseason. That is a shame, because Wells knows how to toast a special occasion. In retirement, he owns a winery with Rockies catcher Chris Iannetta, a former teammate on the Los Angeles Angels. A bottle of their 2015 cabernet sauvignon sells for $125 online, but you can snag their 2016 reserve sauvignon blanc for $35.

He won’t be elected to Cooperstown, but if there were a Hall of Fame for funky ways of standing at the plate, Youkilis would make it on the first try. He placed his feet close together, pinched in his knees and bounced up and down — all while wiggling his bat above his helmet and pointing it at the pitcher, holding his hands apart on the handle. It was performance art at its finest to Gar Ryness, also known as the internet’s Batting Stance Guy, who sums up Youkilis like this: “He’s the Michelangelo of the stance.” MICHAEL YOUNG Young is the career hits leader for the Rangers, which is a pretty cool distinction. Most franchise hits leaders are in the Hall of Fame, but it’s close — 16 are in and 14 are not, though at least two more will be: Derek Jeter (Yankees) and Ichiro Suzuki (Mariners). The others who aren’t yet are Garret Anderson (Angels), Bert Campaneris (Athletics), Luis Castillo (Marlins), Carl Crawford (Rays), Tony Fernandez (Blue Jays) and Luis Gonzalez (Diamondbacks).

sport John Harbaugh will be in demand after the season Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? John Harbaugh will be in demand after the season ProFootball Talk on NBC SportsDecember 9, 2018, 4:06 PM GMT When the Ravens were 4-5 and fading, players on the team believed that coach John Harbaugh would be fired absent a turnaround that takes the team to the playoffs. Three straight wins later, the Ravens are very much alive for the postseason. But Harbaugh could still be out. Scroll to continue with content Ad Per a league source with knowledge of the intricacies of the looming coaching carousel, John Harbaugh currently is viewed as one of the top candidates in the coming searches. Indeed, it’s viewed that John Harbaugh is regarded as being far more desirable than his brother, Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, who recently was linked to vacancies in Green Bay and Cleveland. If John Harbaugh isn’t fired, he can still be in play for a job elsewhere. The new team would contact the Ravens and negotiate compensation in the event Harbaugh is hired. Once an agreement on compensation is reached, the new team would approach Harbaugh directly and negotiate a contract. While those are the formal nuts and bolts of the process, the reality is that much of the pieces will be put in place via the back channels, with a new team gauging Harbaugh’s interest and financial expectations before approaching the Ravens to negotiate his exit. Of course, a successful playoff run could complicate things, delaying Harbaugh’s availability and making it awkward, to say the least, for a team to wait for a guy who may not be available at all. Regardless, as teams begin to assemble their wish lists for 2019, John Harbaugh is expected to appear on more than a few. Which ultimately could make the Ravens decide to keep the guy who has been their head coach since 2008.

sport Lakers talking to Suns about Trevor Ariza trade, per report Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Report: Lakers eyeing Trevor Ariza in trade talks with Suns Jack BaerYahoo SportsDecember 10, 2018, 1:43 AM GMT Trevor Ariza’s tenure in Phoenix could be approaching its end. (AP Photo) Trevor Ariza likely figured his tenure with the Phoenix Suns would be short after signing a one-year, $15 million contract with the team in free agency this offseason, but he probably didn’t think it would be this brief. 26 games into a season to forget for the 4-22 Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers are engaged in trade talks for Ariza that would likely ship out Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to a third team, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. The Suns are reportedly hoping to land a playmaking guard and draft pick in exchange for Ariza. Scroll to continue with content Ad Such a trade would mean the Suns are unloading Ariza as early as legally possible, as players signed in free agency this summer are ineligible to be traded until this Saturday. Why the Lakers would trade for Trevor Ariza There seem to be two major reasons for Los Angeles bringing in Ariza. The first is that Ariza remains a pretty solid player at age 33, currently averaging 9.7 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. The Lakers have enjoyed Ariza’s ex-teammate Tyson Chandler’s leadership and defensive presence since acquiring him from the Suns and adding another veteran could help the team stay in playoff contention while maybe not having to rely on LeBron James to play hero ball every night. The other reason might be more important for the team: Ariza’s expiring contract. The Lakers haven’t exactly made a secret about their intentions for the 2019 free agent class, which is likely to include Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Kemba Walker and many more. The Lakers want to bring in a star, maybe two, and they’re going to need all the salary cap flexibility they can get to do so. Ariza’s one-year deal would give the team even more wiggle room as its heads into that pivotal phase of its future plans.

Henrik Lundqvist stands alone in remarkable Vic Hadfield tribute Vic Hadfield gives Mark Messier the ultimate compliment A night to remember: Rangers honoring legend Vic Hadfield The saga of Brady Skjei’s diminishing confidence and how the Rangers are dealing with it continues. First-year head coach David Quinn made the 24-year-old defenseman a healthy scratch for the team’s 4-3 shootout loss to the Jets on Sunday night at the Garden. It was the third benching this season for the player whom the franchise believes in deeply, but who had a brutal game in Montreal on Saturday night amidst a season of disappointing play. “This is a guy that we have a lot of faith in,” Quinn said. “He’s a really good player having a little bit of a struggle. He’s going to get right back in there and we’re going to get this right. He’s going to be a big part of what we’ve got going on now and the future. It’s not a punishment, it’s more take a deep breath and let’s get back at it.” Before the game, Quinn had said one of his defensemen was “questionable with an unspecific injury.” Whomever that was turned out to be good enough to play, and the healthy Skjei was the one benched. Quinn was happy his players came out and watched the pregame ceremony that sent Vic Hadfield’s No. 11 to the rafters. “It’s important to realize the organization you play for, the history, how much these guys mean to our franchise,” Quinn said. Defenseman Brendan Smith had a difficult game, taking two bad penalties. The second was a cross-check at the start of the third period, the only shift he got that period as Quinn sat him for the final 18:04 of regulation. see also Vinni Lettieri here to make most of his Rangers second chance MONTREAL — It is on Vinni Lettieri to cram the... The club called up veteran winger Matt Beleskey and he made his season debut, getting 8:27 of total ice time on a fourth line with Steven Fogarty and Vinni Lettieri, a line that didn’t play for about the final 9:30 of regulation. The 30-year-old Beleskey had been with AHL Hartford after clearing waivers following training camp, when he missed time with a separated shoulder. Once he got healthy, he put up three goals and nine points in 14 games with the Wolf Pack. “He’s played well down there,” Quinn said. “Went down with an injury, but came back in game shape and has been playing well. He’s a veteran presence out there, and he’s been playing well.” To make room for Beleskey, the Rangers sent Tim Gettinger back to Hartford. The 6-foot-6 20-year-old from Cleveland made his NHL debut on Nov. 24 against the Capitals, but it was a rather uneventful four-game cup of coffee for the 2016 fifth-round pick. Defenseman Tony DeAngelo came back in after he had been a healthy scratch in Montreal. He started paired with Smith, but was mixed and matched in the third period. Mats Zuccarello missed his fifth straight game and the ninth in the team’s past 11 with a right-groin injury. He did take part in the on-ice Hadfield ceremony.

sport David West on Draymond Green-Kevin Durant dust-up: ‘I could’ve stopped it’ Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? David West on Draymond Green-Kevin Durant dust-up: ‘I could’ve stopped it’ Dane DelgadoNBC SportsDecember 10, 2018, 3:00 AM GMT David West used to be a calming influence in the Golden State Warriors locker room. The former two-time All-Star big man retired in August after a long career, and the Warriors are perhaps worse off because of it. West was known to be the guy who could sort out the problems of other teammates, acting as an enforcer and mediator, a focuser of will. That might have come in handy this season as the Warriors have had some internal strife. Scroll to continue with content Ad Draymond Green and Kevin Durant have famously feuded with each other, resulting in a blow up during a game against the Clippers which left Green suspended and Durant miffed. During a recent interview with The Athletic, West said he felt he would have been able to diffuse the situation during the Clippers game and avoid some of the questions about Golden State moving forward. Via The Athletic: “I’m gonna be honest,” West told The Athletic by phone last month. “The only moment (where) I said, ‘Man, I wish I was there,’ was at that Clippers game. When Draymond turned the ball over at the end — and he was going to create the play; he was going to make the play, it just sometimes doesn’t happen — at that moment, when I saw the way he was walking, and I saw KD react, and it was like ‘Oh, I know if I was there that shit wouldn’t have happened.’ That’s the only moment where I felt like, ‘Man I could’ve stopped it.’” At this juncture it’s hard to know just how much the issues between Durant and Green will cause, playoff time. The question about Durant leaving in free agency isn’t of real concern at this moment, mostly because it’s impossible to predict. Story continues From an outside perspective, it does seem like West would have been a major factor during the Durant-Green tiff if he’d been in a Warriors jersey. West went on to say that the idea that Golden State doesn’t have to deal with adversity is “a false narrative”. Will the Warriors be cohesive enough come playoff time? We’ll just have to wait to find out.

sport Manchester United to Face P.S.G. as Champions League Draw Is Made - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Manchester United to Face P.S.G. as Champions League Draw Is Made Supported by Manchester United to Face P.S.G. as Champions League Draw Is Made Image The former player Laura Georges pulled Spurs in the Champions League draw on Monday.CreditCreditSalvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone, via Associated Press By Victor Mather Dec. 17, 2018 Liverpool vs. Bayern Munich and Manchester United vs. Paris St. Germain are two of the more enticing matchups in the round of 16 of the Champions League, which was drawn on Monday. Manchester United is in disarray, standing only sixth in the Premier League and coming off a loss to Liverpool. It will face a daunting task against P.S.G., unbeaten and already 10 points clear in the French league, which it has dominated in recent years. But the prize P.S.G. most covets, the Champions League, has so far eluded it. This will be the first European meeting between the teams. The attacking trio of Kylian Mbappé, Neymar and Edinson Cavani will be particularly imposing against a Manchester United defense that has surrendered 29 goals in 17 games, the fifth highest total in the Premier League. Liverpool is in first place in the Premier League and looking like a strong contender for its first title since 1990. It faces a major obstacle in Bayern, though that team is unexpectedly back in third place in the Bundesliga, which it has won six times in a row. The two other English teams also drew German opposition. Spurs will play Bundesliga leaders Dortmund, and Manchester City will face Schalke. The other games will be Lyon-Barcelona, Ajax-Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid-Juventus and Roma-Porto. The first legs will be played on Feb. 12, 13, 19 and 20 and the second legs on March 5, 6, 12 and 13. Oddsmakers have Manchester City as the favorite to win the event for the first time, followed by Barcelona, Juventus and P.S.G. The winner of the last three Champions Leagues, Real Madrid, is not favored this year; it stands only fourth in the Spanish League and fired its new manager, Julen Lopetegui, in October. Porto, of all teams, had the best record in the group stage at 5-0-1. Though still a long shot to take home the top prize, it does have a relatively kind draw in Roma. The longest shot in the field, at 400-1, is Schalke, which is only 13th in the Bundesliga and must play Manchester City in the round of 16. On balance the last 16 is quite strong; there were few if any upsets in the group stage. Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich leads the competition in scoring so far with eight goals. The Champions League Final is June 1 in Wanda Metropolitano, Atlético Madrid’s home stadium. Also drawn Monday was the Europa League. The 16 matchups include: Malmo vs. the tournament favorite Chelsea, Celtic vs. Valencia, Zurich vs. Napoli, Seville vs. Lazio, and BATE Borisov vs. Arsenal.

sport 4 Reasons the Tampa Bay Lightning Have Dominated the N.H.L.  - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|4 Reasons the Tampa Bay Lightning Have Dominated the N.H.L. Supported by 4 Reasons the Tampa Bay Lightning Have Dominated the N.H.L. Like last season, the team has had a strong first half. This year, it hopes to keep that momentum. Image The Tampa Bay Lightning are 12 points ahead of any other team in the league. CreditCreditChris O'Meara/Associated Press By Andrew Knoll Jan. 4, 2019 LOS ANGELES — At the midway point of the N.H.L. season, the Tampa Bay Lightning find themselves in a position that is pleasantly familiar: the top of the league. Tampa Bay’s 66 points are the most in the N.H.L., as its 61 points were at the same time last season. But the Lightning’s dominance this season is stark. Entering Friday’s games, they are 12 points better than the next-best teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Western Conference-leading Calgary Flames. In a league where nine teams have a point percentage above .700 in their last 10 games, Tampa Bay (32-7-2) has managed to be the hottest club. The Lightning have earned points in 16 games in a row, with winning streaks of eight and seven games flanking an overtime loss to the Winnipeg Jets, a Western Conference power. The Lightning have not lost in regulation since Nov. 27. They outscored opponents by 81-48 during that span and have a league-leading goal differential of plus-55. “You add in the skill set, you add in the leadership qualities that are within this room, it’s one of the best I’ve ever played with,” said Steven Stamkos, an 11-year veteran with the Lightning. “You put all those things together, and you don’t get complacent. Especially when you’re on a stretch like this. We want to win every night. We have that belief that no matter what happens, if we’re down a goal or two early, we’re going to find a way.” Here are four reasons for the Lightning’s first-half success. Image Nikita Kucherov leads the N.H.L. with 69 points.CreditKatharine Lotze/Getty Images Offensive Thunder Over their past 16 contests, the Lightning have averaged more than five goals per game. Their 4.17 goals per game this season are more than a goal above the league average. They lead the N.H.L. with 174 goals, 43 power-play goals and 131 even-strength goals. At the center of it all is right wing Nikita Kucherov, 25, who has seven straight multipoint games and 69 points over all. He has posted four or more points in three of his last five games, including Thursday’s 6-2 drubbing of the Los Angeles Kings. “When you’re feeling the way he is confidence-wise, everything looks so simple for him and almost elegant out there because of how gracefully he’s moving the puck and skating,” said Stamkos, the team captain. “He’s a guy that makes the game look really easy when the things that he’s doing are really hard.” Stamkos, 28, who twice led the N.H.L. in goals, scored 14 in December, the most prolific month of his 11-season career. His 23 goals are tied for the team lead with his fellow center Brayden Point, 22, whose role continues to expand. Point has been playing with Kucherov this season while matching up against top opposing centers defensively. “He’s a guy that doesn’t cheat the game,” Stamkos said of Point. “That’s why he creates so many offensive chances, because he’s always in the right spot. Him and Kuch have been so dynamic out there.” Image Defenseman Ryan McDonagh, acquired last season from the Rangers, has returned to peak form.CreditPaul Sancya/Associated Press Surmounting Injuries The Lightning’s fortunes did not flag despite the lengthy absences of their Norris Trophy-winning defenseman, Victor Hedman, and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, who has started only 21 of the team’s 41 games. Defenseman Anton Stralman also missed 17 games, and forward J.T. Miller is currently week-to-week with an upper-body injury. While Hedman was less than 100 percent, the former Ranger Ryan McDonagh, 29, shouldered a heavy load and has recaptured his peak form. “For me, I’m not playing as much as I did last year, and hopefully that’s going be good in the long term,” said Hedman, 28. “I always want to be playing a lot, but at the same time, part of being a good teammate is about buying into everything. Mac has really stepped in and done a great job. He’s phenomenal defensively, and he’s very good at skating up the ice, joining the play and creating odd-man rushes.” Image Coach Jon Cooper says his team’s unselfishness is the reason for its fast start.CreditChris O'Meara/Associated Press Organizational Depth Tampa Bay brims with talent across its ranks, thanks in large part to former General Manager Steve Yzerman, who stepped down in September for family reasons. Julien BriseBois, a lawyer-turned-N.H.L. executive, assumed control with Yzerman remaining on as a consultant. The overall depth of the Lightning organization and the versatility of its forwards have enabled Coach Jon Cooper to use a variety of lineup configurations. Young forwards like Adam Erne and Anthony Cirelli have cemented themselves as full-time players and frequent contributors. On the blue line, the Lightning have used eight defensemen, seven on a consistent basis. That has often meant rotating four defensemen, including three veterans, into three spots. “Guys want to play in games, but you communicate with them what our plan is,” Cooper said. “You sit there and say, ‘Well, you could play all 82 games or wind up playing 74.’ Those six to eight games you may miss during the year, does that help you come springtime? There’s no real downside to that.” He added: “I truly believe that part of why we’ve had the start we’ve had is because of the unselfishness of the players.” Depth and unselfishness were on display Thursday against the Kings. The fourth line produced two goals. Stamkos passed up two prime shots from the left slot, and his extra passes lead to tap-in goals for Kucherov and Point. Image The Lightning lost to the Washington Capitals in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals last season.CreditChris O'Meara/Associated Press Playoff Disappointments As successful as the Lightning have been this season, they are focused on the spring. They have consistently been a playoff team in recent years but have not won a Stanley Cup since 2004. They lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2015 Cup finals, and as the top seed in the East last season, they fell in the conference finals in seven games to the Washington Capitals, the eventual champion. After leading that series by three games to two, the Lightning lost Games 6 and 7 as Stamkos, Kucherov and Point were held scoreless. This time last season, the Lightning began to drag, allowing the Boston Bruins to catch them at one point in the division race. Nashville and Winnipeg eventually passed Tampa Bay in the final league standings. Seeking to maximize their window for a championship, the Lightning made a big trade at the deadline, landing McDonagh and Miller from the Rangers. BriseBois has said such a move is unlikely this season. The Lightning players and coaches are confident in their roster, and they consider themselves more prepared and motivated for the second half of the season than they were a year ago. “It’s just a different feel this year with the veteran guys that we have and that bitter taste of ending the year disappointed last year,” Stamkos said. “I have no concerns about us taking our foot off the gas.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: 4 Reasons the Lightning Are Eclipsing the Rest of the N.H.L..

sport I feel for him… we'll make it work – Butler responds to Embiid's frustration Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? I feel for him… we'll make it work – Butler responds to Embiid's frustration OmnisportDecember 9, 2018, 11:05 PM GMT I feel for him… we'll make it work – Butler responds to Embiid's frustrationJimmy Butler was asked about comments made by Philadelphia 76ers team-mate Joel Embiid and he replied on Sunday. Philadelphia 76ers recruit Jimmy Butler understands Joel Embiid's unhappiness after the All-Star voiced his frustration with his role. Embiid lamented his role in the 76ers' offense since Butler was acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves in November, having sat out Friday's NBA win at the Detroit Pistons. Philadelphia's Embiid has struggled for form after he was just five-of-17 from the field for 10 points in a loss to the Eastern Conference-leading Toronto Raptors on December 5. Scroll to continue with content Ad Butler – who led the 76ers past the Pistons with his second successive 38-point game – was asked about Embiid's comments on Sunday and he told reporters: "I know where his heart is. His heart is pure. He wants to win. "I could feel for him. It's new for myself, it's new to him. It's new to everybody. But we're ok. I know he wants to win. "We need him, long term. He's been doing a lot on both ends of the floor for this team. That's our best player. I can understand being frustrated. … We'll figure out a way to make sure he’s always successful." Embiid has averaged 26.3 points and 13.3 rebounds per game this season. But he has shot just 29 percent from three-point range, which is the source of his frustration. On Sunday, 76ers head coach Brett Brown said "it's a natural reaction" for Embiid to want more touches in the post. "At times, it's true. He needs the ball," Brown added. "He can get the ball, from time to time, more than maybe he does. … It's a natural response, maybe driven at times out of the frustration of a loss, but it's not anything that is new to me." The 76ers will host the Pistons on Monday,  carrying an 18-9 record into that matchup.   What to Read Next Back Sign in Sports Home Fantasy NFL NBA MLB NHL NCAAF Soccer Golf NCAAB MMA World Cup Boxing NASCAR Tennis WNBA NCAAW Olympics Indycar Horse Racing Cycling Odds Videos Podcasts Rivals Shop Help Jobs Yahoo Sites Home Mail Search News Finance Entertainment Lifestyle Sports Fantasy Sports Weather Tech Shopping Answers Tumblr Tools Help Account Info Careers About Terms (Updated) & Privacy (Updated)
sport In a Sea of Catching Options, Wilson Ramos ‘Commanded the Room’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|In a Sea of Catching Options, Wilson Ramos ‘Commanded the Room’ Supported by On Baseball In a Sea of Catching Options, Wilson Ramos ‘Commanded the Room’ Image The Mets’ new catcher, Wilson Ramos, with General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen at a news conference on Tuesday. Ramos said that the Mets’ face-to-face approach won him over.CreditCreditSeth Wenig/Associated Press By James Wagner Dec. 18, 2018 Before Wilson Ramos put on his new Mets jersey on Tuesday at Citi Field, his employers explored all of their options. They talked to the Miami Marlins about the All-Star catcher J. T. Realmuto but could not stomach the asking price in a trade — particularly after dipping into the farm system earlier in the month to trade for closer Edwin Diaz and second baseman Robinson Cano. They met with Yasmani Grandal, a free agent, in Arizona. To do so, a contingent that included, among others, the chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon; the new general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen; and the former third baseman David Wright slipped away from baseball’s annual winter meetings in Las Vegas. A few days later back in Las Vegas, much of the same group sat down with Ramos. That 45-minute get-together, and Ramos’s price and skills, led to the Mets signing Ramos to a two-year $19 million contract. “He commanded the room,” Van Wagenen said at a news conference on Tuesday. “As you guys can see, he’s a pretty physical presence. His poise and confidence were extremely compelling to us as we sat across from him.” Ramos said: “I felt really good seeing the general manager and owner of the team sitting with me in a room. That gave me confidence that I could help this team and this rotation.” Those face-to-face meetings, in addition to the presence of Wright and the solicitation of other players’ opinions, are examples of Van Wagenen’s style. Since jumping to general manager from agent, he has talked often about contending for the playoffs in 2019 and prioritizing players. Not only did Ramos, a two-time All-Star, check a lot of needed boxes — a right-handed hitter for a lineup full of left-handers, a productive offensive player for a streaky lineup, a stabilizing force for a shaky catching situation — he came at a relatively lower cost than Realmuto and Grandal. Realmuto would probably have cost key players in a trade, and Grandal would probably have cost more money, and a compensatory draft pick and international bonus pool space because he rejected a qualifying offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ramos simply cost dollars. It also helped that the Mets considered Ramos, 31, a better fit than Grandal, 30, in several ways. The easygoing Ramos, who is called the Buffalo for his 6-foot-1 245-pound frame rather than his personality, has a better reputation in the clubhouse. “I want to talk to guys on the phone,” Van Wagenen said of free-agent players. “I want to look at them face to face. The players that are willing to do that are going to put themselves in a better position for us. It’s hard to agent an agent. So I like the opportunity to sit in front of players and make my own evaluations.” While Grandal is perhaps better defensively and a better hitter against right-handed pitching, the Mets had a glaring weakness against left-handed pitching last season. Van Wagenen said Ramos, who has a .301 career average against left-handers, reduced the pressure to add a right-handed-hitting outfielder. During Ramos’s meeting with the Mets, he said team officials did not mention his offense. They asked about his leadership of a pitching staff, his twice surgically repaired right knee and his off-season workouts. “They know what I can do with my bat,” said Ramos, who hit .306 with 15 home runs between the Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies last season. “That made me feel excited because I need to think of only one thing: that’s behind the plate.” In vetting Ramos, in addition to the other options, Van Wagenen said he spoke to some of Ramos’s former coaches and Washington Nationals teammates. When he was an agent, Van Wagenen represented Ramos’s former teammates Ian Desmond, Drew Storen and Ryan Zimmerman. Van Wagenen said that the Mets, in addition to giving Ramos a physical, also examined his medical file and video of his off-season workouts, and felt comfortable that Ramos could stay healthy. Ramos, who has caught more than 120 games in a season only twice because of injuries, said not having to worry about the rehabilitation of his knee this off-season had helped him improve his overall fitness. And there was the presence of Wright in the meetings with the catchers. The former Mets captain ended his playing career in September because of numerous physical ailments, but team officials have worked to make use of his expertise from 15 years in the major leagues. Van Wagenen said last week that Wright provided a needed perspective on matters such as what is important in a teammate and an opposing pitcher. On defense, the Mets valued Ramos’s strong throwing arm, which will help another one of their weaknesses: stolen bases. They liked his desire to teach young pitchers and his experience catching Cy Young Award-winning pitchers such as Blake Snell in Tampa Bay and Max Scherzer in Washington. Ramos has caught three no-hitters: two by Scherzer and one by Jordan Zimmermann. “They have good arms,” Ramos said of a Mets rotation led by Jacob deGrom, the 2018 National League Cy Young Award winner, and Noah Syndergaard. “I want to put my experience behind the plate to help them and win a lot of games.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: In a Sea of Catching Options, Ramos ‘Commanded the Room’.

sport Bears’ Hopes of Beating Eagles End With a Thunk-Thunk-Thud - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Bears’ Hopes of Beating Eagles End With a Thunk-Thunk-Thud Supported by Eagles 16, Bears 15 Bears’ Hopes of Beating Eagles End With a Thunk-Thunk-Thud Image Cody Parkey, center, missed a potential winning field goal for the Bears with seconds left in their loss to the Eagles.CreditCreditMike Dinovo/USA Today Sports, via Reuters By Ben Shpigel Jan. 6, 2019 CHICAGO — Eleven months have elapsed since Philadelphia’s improbable Super Bowl title, and on Sunday it was ever more necessary to re-establish this interval as fact. The playoffs, again, had arrived, and there, again, was Nick Foles, reprising his role as the Eagles’ backup-turned-starter-turned-savior. So, to clarify for anyone squinting at their televisions and wondering how Foles managed to bend time and space: No, he did not actually depart one stadium in the Midwest after bewitching his opponent and then materialize in another to do the same — though such confusion would be understandable. Foles, and the Eagles, seem to inhabit a place untouched by the mayhem churning all around them. Their mojo has been so good for the last month that on Sunday they foiled the league’s most destructive defense with a go-ahead touchdown on fourth down and then watched a kick that would have doomed them clang first off the left upright and then bounce off the crossbar. The final score — Philadelphia 16, Chicago 15 — silenced the crowd at Soldier Field, which hosted its first playoff game in eight years, but not the occupants of the visitors’ sideline, who danced and shouted and swarmed the grass after Cody Parkey’s 43-yard attempt ricocheted to the ground, ushering the Eagles into a divisional-round matchup next Sunday afternoon at top-seeded New Orleans. When the Eagles’ locker room opened to the news media, music was blaring and some players were huddled, watching replays of the kick. Chris Long turned to his fellow defensive end Brandon Graham, sitting beside him, and said, “It’s a hard job being a kicker.” Graham said, “I know, boy.” Above the din, tight end Zach Ertz bellowed, “Club Dub,” referencing the dance party that raged after Bears victories this season, all 12 of them. No strobe lights pulsing in the home locker room Sunday, only the harsh glare of the cameras. “You can’t make this up,” Parkey said. “I feel terrible.” As Parkey’s kick sank to the earth, the Bears’ mascot, Staley Da Bear, perched beneath the crossbar, fell over. The camera panned to Chicago Coach Matt Nagy, who did not blink, his mouth agape. Image Philadelphia’s Golden Tate caught a 2-yard touchdown pass with 56 seconds remaining in the Eagles’ win over the Chicago Bears.CreditMike Dinovo/USA Today Sports, via Reuters In retrospect, the Bears’ biggest blunder of the season came last week, when they beat the Vikings in the last week of the regular season. By winning in Minnesota — where the Eagles captured their first Super Bowl, it should be noted — the Bears granted Philadelphia’s entry into the postseason. Chicago’s reward, after going 12-4 to capture the N.F.C. North and the conference’s third seed, was to face the reigning champions, who barged into the playoffs by winning five of their final six games — the last three behind Foles, in relief, again, of an injured Carson Wentz. The Eagles have a quirky, if enviable, quarterback situation — the franchise star in Wentz and the beloved backup in Foles, who merely secured Philadelphia’s first football championship since 1960. Since ascending to the starting job in Week 15 at Los Angeles — where Wentz injured his knee last season — Foles, unlikely to return to Philadelphia next season, has approached every game knowing it could be his last in an Eagles uniform. He tamed the Rams, then the Texans and the Redskins, but had not yet encountered a defense as dominant as Chicago’s. Just how dominant? The Bears were the only team this season with more interceptions (27) than touchdown passes allowed (22). Even after Chicago added two more interceptions Sunday — after the first 25 minutes, he had been picked off more times than in his previous four playoff games combined — Foles remained at peace. “What I’ve learned on these stages,” Foles said, “is just how to calm myself in a chaotic moment.” He simplifies. He gazes at 10 players he trusts in the huddle. He calls the play. With 4 minutes 48 seconds remaining and trailing by 15-10, Philadelphia took over at its 40 and in the huddle Foles simplified, gazed, trusted — and found Alshon Jeffery for 15 yards. He guided the Eagles to the Bears’ 2, converting a third-and-9 to Jeffery, before three straight plays backfired. Before fourth-and-their-season, Coach Doug Pederson signaled timeout. Expecting the Bears to blitz, Pederson called a play that would move the pocket for Foles, who rolled to his right and sidearmed a toss to Golden Tate, who caught it on the goal line and spun into the end zone with 56 seconds left. Image Nick Foles, who was Philadelphia’s backup until Week 15, threw for 266 yards and two touchdowns in the win.CreditMike Dinovo/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The moment reminded Foles of his first playoff game with the Eagles, at home five years ago against New Orleans back in his first stint with Philadelphia. He threw a late go-ahead touchdown pass in that game — and then saw Darren Sproles, now his teammate, gash them with a long kickoff return that positioned the Saints for the winning field goal. And on Sunday, after Philadelphia missed the 2-point conversion, Foles, who completed 25 of 40 passes for 266 yards, watched Tarik Cohen ran back the ensuing kickoff 35 yards. “That definitely came into my mind a little bit,” Foles said of the New Orleans game. Mitch Trubisky, whose 22-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 9:04 left had put the Bears ahead by 15-10, directed the Bears to the Eagles’ 25, where Parkey measured his fourth attempt of the day. His travails this season have unnerved Bears fans, who sulked as he missed 10 kicks — seven field goals and three extra points. He drilled his initial try, but Philadelphia had called timeout before the kick to ice him. The second bounced off the yellow posts and onto the turf. When it was noted to Pederson at a news conference last week that Foles had not lost the last two Decembers (and beyond), Pederson banged the wooden lectern for, you know, luck. That was superfluous. He oversees a team that trampled favored New England in the Super Bowl, that has coalesced after a 48-7 defeat Nov. 18 in New Orleans, that outclassed the league’s top defense on the road. The same Eagles group that donned dog masks last postseason — at once lampooning their perceived underdog status and welcoming it — has birthed a new wearable gimmick: ski masks. As if robbers, they started stealing the ball. Then they started stealing wins. Then they stole a playoff berth. Then they stole victory from the Bears. Ask the Eagles, and they say are not done. They have been down a similar path before, and found a trophy at the end. New Orleans, beware.

sport Report: Broncos denying interview requests for Gary Kubiak Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Report: Broncos denying interview requests for Gary Kubiak Josh AlperProFootball Talk on NBC SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 6:12 PM GMT In a press conference after the firing of former head coach Vance Joseph, Broncos General Manager John Elway said that Gary Kubiak could return to the coaching staff as the team’s offensive coordinator this year and that he would remain in the organization in one role or another. They’re reportedly making sure of that by denying interview requests from other teams that want to talk to Kubiak about their own coordinator vacancies. Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that the Falcons and Bengals have both requested permission to interview Kubiak since the end of the regular season. Per the report, Kubiak wants to remain with Denver so he may not have taken the interviews anyway. Health issues caused Kubiak to step down as the Broncos’ head coach after the 2016 season and he has worked for the team in a personnel role the last couple of years. Steelers offensive line coach Mike Munchak, former Colts coach Chuck Pagano, Rams quarterbacks coach Zac Taylor, Patriots linebackers coach Brian Flores and Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio are on the list of candidates for the head coaching job in Denver.

sport Could the Bucs and Bruce Arians be a good fit? Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Bucs reportedly interested in Bruce Arians for head-coaching job, and feeling is mutual Frank SchwabYahoo SportsJanuary 5, 2019, 6:03 PM GMT Bruce Arians said during last season that he’d only return to coach the Cleveland Browns. Perhaps he just got bored in the broadcast booth. Arians has expanded his options, it seems. The former Arizona Cardinals coach, who is a two-time NFL coach of the year, could end up with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers are interested in Arians and the feeling is mutual, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said. Scroll to continue with content Ad Arians has a strong history of coaching quarterbacks, and presumably the Buccaneers like the possible fit with him and Jameis Winston. The Buccaneers announced Saturday morning they interviewed Arians. We have completed an interview with Bruce Arians for our head coach position. #GoBucs pic.twitter.com/DEFXXWHZg5 — Tampa Bay Buccaneers (@Buccaneers) January 5, 2019 Bruce Arians could come out of retirement Arians seemed retired when he stepped away following the 2017 season. He is 66 years old, and has some documented health issues. But he can still coach. Arians won NFL coach of the year as an interim in 2012 when then-Colts coach Chuck Pagano was battling cancer. Then Arians won the award again in 2014. Arians, who spent last season broadcasting games with CBS, has a long track record of offensive success. His trademark is throwing deep, with many of his play-calls operating with the quarterback looking for the long pass first, then reading back toward the line of scrimmage. That might be good for Winston, who likes taking chances. Buccaneers need the right coach for Jameis Winston Story continues Winston has had an up-and-down career, on and off the field, and 2019 is a big season for his future. The Buccaneers decided to bring him back for 2019, when he’ll be on the fifth and final year of his rookie deal. Given Winston’s off-field issues, there’s no guarantee he’ll get the huge extension most quarterbacks get. Whoever gets the Buccaneers’ head coaching job will inherit Winston, and turning him into a consistent, effective quarterback will be the biggest priority. The Buccaneers haven’t been good in a while but getting Winston to play at a Pro Bowl level could turn that around. Arians would be an interesting fit, if nothing else. There aren’t a lot of great candidates this cycle, especially for a Bucs franchise that hasn’t won in a while and has a lot of uncertainty at quarterback. Landing a two-time coach of the year might be the best fit, if it happens. Former Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians could get an interview for the Buccaneers’ head-coaching vacancy.

sport M.L.S. Reaches Agreement to Keep Crew in Columbus - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|M.L.S. Reaches Agreement to Keep Crew in Columbus Supported by M.L.S. Reaches Agreement to Keep Crew in Columbus Image Columbus fans waged a yearlong campaign to keep their team from moving.CreditCreditJay Laprete/Associated Press By Andrew Das Dec. 28, 2018 Major League Soccer announced Friday that it had reached an agreement to transfer control of the Columbus Crew to a local ownership group that has pledged to keep the team in Ohio. The deal will prevent the Crew’s threatened move to Austin, Tex., and end an ugly fight that had driven a wedge between the team’s fans and the organization — at the same time it highlighted the power of fan activism in driving the direction of a pro sports team. Friday’s announcement that Crew’s current owner, Precourt Sports Ventures, had agreed to surrender control of the team to a group that includes the owner of the N.F.L.’s Cleveland Browns, included the caveat that the final agreement had not been signed. But the new owners have announced plans to build a new stadium for the team, and M.L.S. said the group — led by the Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and the longtime Crew team physician Peter Edwards — would take over the team’s operations in January. And there you have it: Today, we are proud to announce an achievement many said was unattainable: The Columbus Crew is saved. https://t.co/utrJogw8z6 pic.twitter.com/haFu4aSfK3— Mayor Andrew Ginther (@MayorGinther) December 28, 2018 The agreement is a triumph for fans in Ohio who, blindsided by the October 2017 announcement that the Crew’s owners were pursuing a move to Texas, had mounted a tenacious public fight to save their team. That effort, fought with banners in the stands, with hashtags online and in public protests in Columbus, quickly won the support of current and former players. But the fan-led effort also smartly engaged with city and state politicians and members of the Columbus business community to find a solution, and that work seemed to have paid off in October, when M.L.S. announced that the Haslam-Edwards group was in talks to acquire the Crew. On Friday, M.L.S. said those talks had produced “an agreement in principle with the Haslam and Edwards families for them to assume an ownership position in Major League Soccer and operate Columbus Crew S.C. starting in January 2019.” City and state officials had telegraphed that a deal was imminent earlier Friday, when they dropped a lawsuit that had sought to prevent the team from moving. But while fans, Crew players and Columbus officials cheered the deal to keep the Crew in Ohio, it was also a quiet victory for M.L.S., which extricated itself from an uncomfortable situation — partly of its own making, since it had granted Precourt Sports Ventures the right to pursue a move in the first place — in which one of the league’s original teams would have abandoned its home city. The yearlong drama surrounding the potential move had been a black eye for the league, and the worst of several prominent rifts between fans and their teams. League officials insisted that their preference was to keep the team in Columbus, even as they noted that the Crew, which entered the league in 1996, its inaugural season, ranked near the bottom of the league in metrics like sponsorship, attendance and ticket sales. In a statement Friday, Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, acknowledged “the tremendous collaboration and community support” for the Crew, which he said had “set the stage for a powerful plan that includes a world-class soccer stadium — a critical step that will help ensure the club’s success on and off the field.” Precourt Sports Ventures and its chief executive, Anthony Precourt, who had actively courted politicians and fans in Texas, appear set to remain in the league there. While the Haslam group is a new investor in M.L.S. — under the league’s single-entity structure, owners buy a stake in the league and are granted the right to operate individual teams — Precourt is expected to retain his equity stake and transfer it to a new expansion team in Austin in the next few years. (The Crew’s history and records will remain in Columbus with the team.) This month, Precourt Sports Ventures and the city of Austin announced that they had agreed to terms on a partnership that would result in the construction of a 20,000-seat stadium that would open during the 2021 M.L.S. season and serve as the home of a new team, Austin F.C.

East, Slow Rebuilds Are Not in Vogue Image On Dec. 4, the Mets’ leadership introduced Edwin Diaz and Robinson Cano, a pair of star players acquired from the Seattle Mariners.CreditCreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times By Tyler Kepner Dec. 12, 2018 LAS VEGAS — Late last season, as his Atlanta Braves surged to a division crown nobody else seemed to want, Manager Brian Snitker took pride in the youthful buzz throughout his dugout. “It was like an American Legion team — the energy, the excitement, pulling for each other, caring about each other,” he said. “It’s a team that the city should be excited about watching because they’re very entertaining.” It was not quite like this for their division rivals in Washington, New York, Philadelphia and Miami. The Nationals flopped in Bryce Harper’s final season before free agency. The Mets teased their fans with a fast start, then quickly faded. The Phillies fell apart down the stretch. The Marlins finished last, as expected, but Snitker figured the others would act quickly to rebound. “When the playoffs were over,” said Snitker, whose team lost a division series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, “I was sitting around like, ‘Those other teams aren’t going to sit on their thumbs all winter. They’re going to get better, they’re going to do things to improve their clubs.’ And us included.” While the winter meetings here in Las Vegas have mostly lacked the sizzle of the setting — no risky bets or reckless gambling — you cannot blame the National League East, whose top four teams had been busy well before checking into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino at the start of the week. The Braves, Nationals, Phillies and Mets have added 10 former All-Stars this off-season: third baseman Josh Donaldson and catcher Brian McCann with Atlanta; starter Patrick Corbin, catchers Kurt Suzuki and Yan Gomes and reliever Trevor Rosenthal with Washington; shortstop Jean Segura and outfielder Andrew McCutchen with Philadelphia; and second baseman Robinson Cano and closer Edwin Diaz with the Mets. Image The Washington Nationals got even stronger in terms of starting pitching by signing Patrick Corbin, the top free-agent starter on the market.CreditPablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press The Marlins unveiled yet another new color scheme (“caliente red, Miami blue, midnight back and slate grey,” they call it) while shopping their best player, catcher J.T. Realmuto. Still, the N.L. East may be the only division with at least four teams building for 2019 instead of standing still or tearing down. “If we’re not playing in a division that’s competitive, I don’t think it’s nearly as much fun for us to do our jobs,” said Brodie Van Wagenen, the Mets’ new general manager. “I want to have a little bit of adrenaline flow when I feel like I’m trying to win something. I wake up every day with a competitive spirit and I want to be better than the guys in our division.” The Mets are not shopping in the upper tier of free agency, but several players who interest them have been meeting with teams here, including catcher Wilson Ramos and outfielder Adam Jones, who both hit right-handed, like A.J. Pollock, another outfielder the Mets like. The Mets want to balance their left-leaning lineup while upgrading their catching and bullpen, without creating still more holes in their roster. The Mets beat out the Phillies for Diaz, the prized closer the Seattle Mariners attached to the expensive Cano to extract top prospects (while also taking on Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak) from the Mets. The Phillies are still pursuing a free-agent closer, with Zach Britton a top target. Britton’s agent, Scott Boras, also represents Harper, the slugging outfielder who already turned down a 10-year, $300 million offer to stay in Washington. The Nationals’ owner, Mark Lerner, has said he expects Harper to sign elsewhere. For all of Harper’s accomplishments — six All-Star appearances, a Most Valuable Player Award, a career .900 on-base plus slugging percentage — the Nationals never won a playoff series with him. They traded starter Tanner Roark to Cincinnati on Wednesday for reliever Tanner Rainey but have plowed $525 million into contracts for starting pitchers Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Corbin. Two dynamic young outfielders — Juan Soto, 20, and Victor Robles, 21 — could help cover for the possible loss of Harper. “If he’s not back, I like the way we’re set up — we’re super athletic, we’ve got young, exciting players,” Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said Tuesday, calling the Corbin signing an early Christmas present. “Adding Patrick Corbin, with Scherzer and Strasburg, those are three pretty good horses.” Image Andrew McCutchen, who split last season between the Giants and Yankees, signed a three-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, a team that also might be pursuing one of baseball’s top free agents: Manny Machado.CreditFrank Franklin II/Associated Press Harper and shortstop Manny Machado are the prizes of another slow-moving free-agent class. The Phillies’ owner, John Middleton — whose net worth is said to be around $3 billion — has said he would be “a little bit stupid” about spending money this winter. Boras or Machado’s agent, Dan Lozano, seem poised to take him up on it. “I’ll be honest with you, if, in a life and in a career, I looked at where John is, I would really like to be that stupid,” Boras said. Boras has negotiated some of his most lucrative deals in January and February, and the Harper talks — like those for Machado — could drag. Phillies General Manager Matt Klentak said this week that the team would not “be held hostage by one or two players,” to which Boras responded Wednesday with a warning of sorts. “In the end, all organizations are going to look back on this opportunity, and they’re going to say, ‘What should I have done? What steps should I have taken?’” Boras said. “These are pivotal moments. There’s a lot of organizations and general managers who will be evaluated about what they did do or what they didn’t do when you have the availability of a player like this.” Boras has not conceded that a different Eastern team — the Yankees, in the American League East — is truly out on Harper. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman has dismissed the possibility of signing Harper, because his outfield is already crowded and because he is unmoved by Harper’s offer to learn first base. Yet Boras is undeterred. He cited the Yankees’ surprising late strike for first baseman Mark Teixeira 10 years ago, and counted them in again with an amusing analogy, a rite of every winter meetings. “When the nurse walks in the room with the thermometer, the issue is not what the thermometer says that day,” Boras said. “The issue is: What’s the health of the patient when they’re ready to leave the hospital? They’re not ready to leave the hospital yet.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: N.L. East, Wide Open, Rebuilds For Present.

The undefeated Knights, winners of 25 straight games, will meet LSU of the SEC in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1 at 1 p.m. in Glendale, Ariz. after finishing eighth in the playoff rankings. Athletic director Danny White took a shot at the selection committee on Twitter, by calling the four-team playoff an “invitational” and not a true playoff. It was White who last year pushed the AAC school’s claim as national champions despite not getting invited to the playoff. The Knights, it should be noted, did lose star quarterback McKenzie Milton to a season-ending knee injury last weekend, but still repeated as league champions Saturday. “I’m not sitting in that room, so I don’t know what else this program needs to do,” UCF coach Josh Heupel told reporters. “We’re going to continue to compete at a high level and continue to go play football games, and hopefully win a bunch of them.” Committee chairman Rob Mullens said the Knights didn’t play enough quality teams compared to the four programs chosen to compete in the playoff. They didn’t have a single win over anyone in the committee’s final top-25 rankings. A similar statement was made last year before Central Florida beat SEC foe Auburn in the Peach Bowl. The Knights will get another chance to prove they belonged against 11th-ranked LSU. see also College Football Playoff revealed, with a No. 4 debate The College Football Playoff committee went chalk.

Saban said Sunday that Tagovailoa, who struggled in the game, completing 10-of-25 passes for 164 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions before leaving in the fourth quarter, will be out two weeks before hopefully returning to practice as he recovers from a procedure on the ankle. Syracuse will be aiming for its first double-digit victory season since 2001 on Dec. 28 when it meets West Virginia in the Camping World Bowl in Orlando, Fla.

sport Opinion | The Tao of Gravity  - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Opinion|The Tao of Gravity Opinion Supported by Sporting The Tao of Gravity All martial arts are a quest for beauty and transcendence. I found those not in doing karate but rather having karate done to me. By Gare Joyce Mr. Joyce is a features editor for Sportsnet. Dec. 8, 2018 Image CreditCreditJenny Zych Two hundred men and women knelt in rapt and reverential silence. All of them wore crisp, white karate outfits, or gis, cinched with black belts. Hardened karate-ka who had trained two decades and earned third- and fourth-dan black belts took honored places in the front row. I was in the back by the fire exit. We were gathered in a university gym in Toronto for an international tournament. I was in my late 30s at the time. With my still new first dan, I felt like a humble 10-handicapper in the company of Tiger Woods. At the front of the hall stood the shihan, a master instructor with a seventh dan. He was demonstrating leg sweeps, techniques associated with judo more than karate. In Japan, he had been a university judo champion. At this point, the shihan passed over the champions up front and summoned me from the ranks. Karate etiquette demands stoicism, but the skepticism in the ranks was not entirely disguised. “Kame,” he said. Kame was my far-from-fearsome handle in the dojo. English translation: Turtle. This wasn’t intended to evoke Gamera, the monster turtle who fought Godzilla in Japanese horror films. And all of this predated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. No, Turtle had been my boyhood nickname because I had a pet tortoise. The tag proved apropos for an entirely different reason, a gift that revealed itself in the dojo: I could fall. Yes, my best asset was a durable back. I know what you’re thinking: Anyone can fall, it’s just gravity. But you’re wrong. Breaking a fall is as complex as any offensive technique. You’re utterly exposed and in immediate danger of real physical harm. Your opponent has weaponized the ultimate blunt force object: the floor. In this instance with the shihan, a hardwood floor. I spent many hours practicing break-falls, some from great heights. I did judo in grade school. In prep school, I routinely recreated Dick Van Dyke’s tumble over the footstool in the intro to his old TV show, a letter-perfect judo break-fall. I could have paid my way through school working as an adolescent stuntman. I was 200 pounds back then and my break-falls produced thunderclaps, like sound effects laid over fight scenes in “Enter the Dragon.” In hockey circles, they’ll say that a guy on the wrong end of a one-sided fight has been “rag-dolled.” In karate circles, they say nothing. Instead, they kneel and study the physics of bodies in motion. All martial arts are a quest for beauty and transcendence. I found those not in doing karate but rather having karate done to me. I was honored to be tossed like a bag of wet cement by the shihan. There was no looking down for a soft spot to fall, nor for the leg that would undercut my own. I had to properly simulate the fighting condition, willing myself unaware of my fate so that I didn’t reflexively start falling until I was actually being felled. On my descent, I locked eyes with the shihan and grabbed a fistful of the sleeve of his gi. I had let him and gravity do their business and landed in position to counter. He might have been the only one in the room who recognized this, but no matter — it wasn’t about me, and I wasn’t brought up to compete. The shihan let go of me. I sprang to my feet and assumed a fighting position. Once again I was thrown to the floor. And again. And 20 times more. Each time I broke my fall as if out of an ancient textbook, none the worse for wear. In the material world the martial arts are often described and even advertised as a means of self-defense. You sincerely hope you never have to use your martial art outside a dojo. And you definitely hope that you never have to perform a break-fall in any situation. That said, my ability to fall spared me injury and possibly saved my life in the workplace. My job as a sportswriter has often landed me in strange circumstances, but none stranger than my trip in 1991 to Calgary, Alberta, to write about Bret Hart, a big dog in the World Wrestling Federation. This led to a fateful encounter with Bret’s father, Stu, who had retired as the proprietor of Stampede Wrestling, leaders in the mayhem industry in Western Canada. Stu Hart began his ring career in the 1940s and threw one of his last elbow smashes in apparent anger on an early-1990s pay-per-view show, knocking out Bret’s rival Shawn Michaels. Some doubted the authenticity of that blow: Could a septuagenarian really ice a 240-pound champion in his prime? I, too, considered it far-fetched, but only until I wound up in the same position with Hart as I had with the shihan. That position, as ever, was supine. I was interviewing Hart and minding my manners when he asked me about a splint on the middle finger of my left hand. To my instant regret I told him my finger had been dislocated blocking a roundhouse kick in the dojo. This prompted what old-school wrestlers called a “snatching,” an act of bodily appropriation that I was powerless to fend off while trying to take notes. “I could shoot an angle,” he said. “You’d be the wrestling reporter.” Before I could beg off this narrative, I was in fact a wrestling reporter, or at least a reporter being wrestled. Hart lifted me to shoulder height and body-slammed me onto his dining-room floor. Chin in, arms extended, hitting the floor with open hands: check, check and check. I took inventory: I was in one piece and breathing, but the latter seemed only temporary as 270 pounds of wrestling history landed on me. Reverting to his days in the ring, Hart started to choke me out. Thankfully his wife, Helen, happened on the scene. Rather than counting me out, she offered profuse apologies and upbraided her husband for snatching yet another guest. I thanked her for the well-timed intervention but told her no apology was necessary. If you want to start to understand a fighting art, you have to be willing to go to the mat. The warrior might be as sacred as Shihan or as slapstick as Stu, but regardless best viewed from the ground up.

sport Would Tua Tagovailoa Have Won the Heisman If He Hadn’t Gotten Injured? Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Would Tua Tagovailoa Have Won the Heisman If He Hadn’t Gotten Injured? Laken LitmanSports IllustratedDecember 9, 2018, 4:22 AM GMT NEW YORK — Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray won the 84th Heisman Trophy on Saturday night and it wasn’t even close, contrary to the overarching pre-ceremony story line. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was the frontrunner all season. But Murray ran away with college football’s most coveted prize, earning 517 first-place votes (2,167 total points) to Tagovailoa’s 299 (1,871). Now the question has to be asked: Would Tagovailoa have won if he hadn’t gotten hurt in the SEC championship game? Scroll to continue with content Ad Would Texas have beat Alabama to win the 2009 national championship if Colt McCoy didn’t get hurt? There’s no conclusive way to determine these things. But there are some interesting statistics compiled by Deloitte, the independent accounting firm that tabulates the Heisman ballots, which show how much the SEC and Big 12 championship games may have affected the final 2018 votes. According to a graphic provided by Deloitte, Tagovailoa had a slim 294–215 edge over Murray before conference championship weekend when only 13% of voters had cast their ballots. The Alabama quarterback held a wider margin as more votes came in during the title games, 336–257. But after the games were finished, Murray took over the lead. Despite the final tally not being nearly as close as anyone predicted, Tagovailoa did earn the most points ever for a Heisman runner-up. Murray’s win was the first time in Heisman history that quarterbacks from the same school won in consecutive years (Baker Mayfield won last year). Oklahoma now has seven winners, pushing them into a three-way tie with Notre Dame and Ohio State for the most all-time. Tagovailoa would have been Alabama’s first quarterback and only the program’s third winner. LITMAN: Kyler Murray's Heisman Win Further Proves His Transcendent Talent Story continues Murray, who plans to pursue a Major League Baseball career with the Oakland Athletics after he leads Oklahoma as far as he can in the College Football Playoff, has had a historic season. He’s completed more than 70% of his passes and has the nation’s highest passing efficiency rating. And he’s also the first player in FBS history to average 300 yards passing and 60 yards rushing, while leading Oklahoma to its fourth Big 12 title and its second consecutive playoff berth. His Heisman stock rose even more earlier this week when he was named the Associated Press player of the year and won the Davey O’Brien Award for the nation’s best quarterback. So, it’s not like he wasn’t deserving. Tagovailoa has owned headlines all season by revolutionizing Alabama’s offense. He put together one of the finest seasons in program history—despite never playing a full game—completing 67.7% of his passes and throwing for 3,353 yards with 37 touchdowns and only four interceptions. The first-year starter powered the Tide to score 47.9 points per game. But what’s made Tagovailoa most dangerous and Alabama’s offense so intimidating is the frightening pace at which he can score. This season Alabama scored a touchdown on its opening drive in 10 of 13 games, and those possessions averaged 1:55 in length. In the SEC championship game though, Tagovailoa actually looked human. He completed 10 of 25 passes for 164 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions before leaving the game in the fourth quarter with a high ankle sprain. Backup Jalen Hurts replaced him and saved the season. During his weekend in New York City, Tagovailoa wore a walking boot to protect his recently surgically repaired left ankle. Alabama trainer Jeff Allen even taped him up before the ceremony so he wouldn’t have to wear the bulky brace. Had he won, it likely would have been the first time a Heisman winner hoisted the trophy with a taped ankle. The best part about this outcome, whether the national majority agrees with the voters or not, is that Murray and Tagovailoa will get to face off in the Orange Bowl on Dec. 29. That’s something Tide players and coaches can get behind. Dec 29 it’s up????? — Isaiah D.

Noah Vonleh was a top-10 pick by Charlotte in 2014, but the Knicks already are his fourth team in five NBA seasons. But the 6-foot-10 power forward out of Indiana looks as if he’s possibly finding a home in New York, doing a little bit of everything in starting 17 of the Knicks’ first 24 games. “It’s the versatility, man. I didn’t realize how versatile he was,” Fizdale said Sunday. “[General manager] Scott Perry just kept saying it to me. ‘Coach, when this kid was in high school, man, this kid could do everything.’ He said, ‘I’m not telling you to have him do everything, but see if you can pull some of that stuff out of him.’ “The first day Noah got here, I was playing pickup with our guys and the first thing I told him was: ‘If you rebound the ball, you’ve got to push it. I don’t want you outletting the ball.’ And his eyes lit up and I think from there he saw that I was going to have a lot of confidence in him to try some stuff. Now he’s shooting the 3, he’s posting. He does everything. I think I’ve said it before, he’s our most complete player.” The 23-year-old Vonleh is averaging 8.3 points and 8.1 rebounds in 25.0 minutes per game; he made all six of his shots (15 points) in Saturday’s overtime win over Milwaukee and played tough defense against Giannis Antetokounmpo before fouling out in OT. see also Why Noah Vonleh chose Knicks — and why he's glad he did Knicks offseason free-agent acquisition Noah Vonleh takes a shot at... “I think Scott Perry showing belief in him, he felt that, too, saying ‘We want you here.’ A lot of times that’s how you need to hear it,” Fizdale said. “The fact that he came in and really took to everything we asked of him about his diet, his nutrition, his conditioning, he was just an open book, man, and he let us do what we do. The results have really come.” Guard Trey Burke has been ruled out of Monday’s game with a sprained right knee suffered on an awkward landing following a layup attempt in Saturday’s first quarter. Fizdale said Courtney Lee didn’t get off the bench Saturday after being activated off the injured list (neck) because he “was just kind of waiting for an opportunity to get him in there, but I thought I’d be putting him in a bad spot to just throw him out there in that situation.

sport Thai Court Holds Bahraini Soccer Star Who Escaped Persecution - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Asia Pacific Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Asia Pacific|Thai Court Holds Bahraini Soccer Star Who Escaped Persecution Supported by Thai Court Holds Bahraini Soccer Star Who Escaped Persecution Image Hakeem al-Araibi, once a star defender for the Bahraini national soccer team, is taken to court in Bangkok, Thailand, on Tuesday.CreditCreditDiego Azubel/EPA, via Shutterstock By Hannah Beech Dec. 11, 2018 A political refugee who spoke out against a powerful ruling family in the Gulf moved one step closer on Tuesday to being extradited to his native Bahrain by the Thai authorities. A Thai court formally extended the detention of Hakeem al-Araibi, once a star defender for the Bahraini national soccer team, for 60 days, during which Thailand’s immigration department can prepare his extradition. Mr. Araibi was stopped last month at an airport in Bangkok after a flight from Australia, where he had been living as a legal refugee after fleeing a crackdown on Arab Spring protesters in the small Gulf nation. Mr. Araibi was initially detained because of an Interpol red notice, an alert from the global police agency meant to inform nations about individuals with active arrest warrants, the Thai authorities said. While red notices are not legally binding, they can be used to detain fugitives so they can be extradited to the country where they were convicted of a crime. But red notices have also been abused by authoritarian governments that want to bring home critics who have fled abroad, human rights groups say. That is why Interpol over the past several years has instituted reforms that require the agency to vet each person who is added to the red notice database. Refugees like Mr. Araibi are also supposed to be exempt from red notices. Yet, critics say, Interpol has not been rigorous enough in ensuring that the red notice database is not being used to settle political vendettas. Nearly a week after he was detained in Bangkok, Interpol rescinded the red notice for Mr. Araibi, Thai officials said. By that time, however, Mr. Araibi was already behind bars in a country with a record of sending asylum-seekers back to countries where there is credible evidence that they will face torture or political persecution, including China, Pakistan and Bahrain. Thai officials said they were keeping him in detention because they had received an extradition request from the Bahraini authorities, based on a 10-year jail sentence for charges including vandalism that human rights groups say was politically motivated. “This is a guy with a public profile who’d fled a country where he made credible allegations about being tortured to the point that he was granted asylum in Australia,” said Bruno Min, a senior policy adviser for Fair Trials, a global criminal justice watchdog. “Why was the red notice on him allowed to be published in the first place? What this shows is that the system put in place is still not good enough to stop abuses from happening.” Bahrain has a history of using red notices to force dissidents to return home. In 2014, Thailand, acting on an Interpol alert, turned over another critic of the Bahraini ruling family to officials from there. The United Nations said evidence suggests that dissident was beaten severely during his journey back to Bahrain, and he remains in prison. In 2014, Mr. Araibi was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison for having vandalized a police station. Yet minutes before that crime supposedly occurred, he was playing in a televised soccer match. The judge who convicted him is a member of Bahrain’s ruling Khalifa family. After fleeing abroad, Mr. Araibi spoke out against a senior Bahraini soccer official, whom he accused of allowing the torture and imprisonment of members of the national team believed to have supported the Arab Spring protests in Bahrain. Some are still in jail. That official, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, also a member of Bahrain’s ruling family, is the head of the Asian Football Confederation and a vice president of FIFA, the international body governing soccer. In 2016, Sheikh Salman ran, unsuccessfully, to lead FIFA. Concerns over how his family was ruling Bahrain helped to scuttle his candidacy. Mr. Araibi said that he believed Sheikh Salman had failed to stop his torture. Last week, in a rare political intercession, FIFA, which was been plagued by corruption scandals, called for Mr. Araibi’s return to Australia. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, has also urged Thailand to allow Mr. Araibi to fly back to Australia. The protests against the Sunni Muslim ruling family of Bahrain were broad-based, with some 200,000 people, many members of the nation’s Shiite majority participating, human rights groups said. Mr. Araibi’s brother participated in the protests and Mr. Araibi said in a phone call from detention in Bangkok that his brother’s activity prompted his eventual torture. The sequence of events preceding Mr. Araibi’s detention at a Bangkok airport on Nov. 27 has led activists to question whether Thailand may have informed the Bahraini authorities about Mr. Araibi’s upcoming trip. In October, Mr. Araibi and his wife applied for visas to holiday in Thailand. In early November, that visa was granted. The Interpol red notice, which stemmed from a request from Bahrain, was only vetted and published after Mr. Araibi received visa approval from the Thai immigration authorities. “In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, the repressive Gulf states seem confident that their global hunt of expat dissidents can continue without fear of consequences,” said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy in London, referring to the killing of the prominent Saudi journalist in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Over the weekend, the Thai Foreign Ministry said that Thailand carried out the detention after requests from both Bahraini- and Australian-based authorities. “The detention was carried out in response to the red notice alert received from the Interpol National Central Bureau of Australia and the formal request from the Bahraini government for his arrest and extradition,” the statement read. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, along with the Australian Federal Police, did not respond to requests for comment. But it would be unusual for officials in a country that had given Mr. Araibi refugee status to have also reported him to the Thais. Australia has extradited individuals with red notices on them to countries where rights groups say they could be subjected to torture, such as Egypt. And it is possible for different bureaucracies within one country to work at cross purposes, rights watchdogs said. “Quite often, with red notices, we have seen that there’s not a lot of dialogue between two different bodies, like law enforcement and immigration,” said Mr. Min of Fair Trials, which has extensively researched abuses of Interpol red alerts. On Tuesday, Mr. Araibi’s request for bail was denied, said his lawyer, Nadthasiri Bergman. He will be transferred from immigration detention to Bangkok’s notoriously overcrowded remand prison while his case works its way through the courts. The process could take weeks. Mr. Araibi and his wife had wanted to spend a belated honeymoon in Thailand, he said. From detention, he described his bewilderment at how a planned holiday had transformed into the likelihood that he would be forced to return to a country where human rights groups say thousands of people have been tortured for their involvement in the crushed Arab Spring movement. “My wife and I, we want a vacation,” Mr. Araibi said. “I do not want to go back to a torture place.” Ryn Jirenuwat contributed reporting.

sport Chelsea Signs Christian Pulisic for $73 Million - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Chelsea Signs Christian Pulisic for $73 Million Supported by Chelsea Signs Christian Pulisic for $73 Million Image Christian Pulisic will finish the season with Borussia Dortmund.CreditCreditFrancisco Seco/Associated Press By Rory Smith Jan. 2, 2019 Chelsea has paid Borussia Dortmund $73 million to complete the signing of Christian Pulisic, making the 20-year-old the most expensive American player in history by some distance. Though moving to the Premier League has “always been Christian’s dream,” according to Dortmund’s technical director, Michael Zorc, Pulisic will have to wait six months for it to be realized. He will spend the remainder of this season on loan at the Bundesliga leader, before joining up with Maurizio Sarri’s team in the summer. In a heartfelt statement posted on Twitter on Wednesday morning, Pulisic thanked the German club for the “opportunities” it had offered him since he arrived as a “raw, excited, very nervous but exceptionally proud 16-year-old from a small American town called Hershey.” He said it had been an “honor and a dream” to play for the club, and a “privilege” to experience the support of Dortmund’s fans. He told fans there was no need to doubt his “passion, determination and 110 percent commitment” as Dortmund attempt to win a first German title since 2013. He had, however, made it clear in recent months both to Zorc and Hans-Joachim Watzke, Dortmund’s chief executive, that he did not intend to extend his contract — due to expire in 2020 — at Signal Iduna Park. Instead, he had set his heart on moving to England, something related to his “American background,” according to Zorc. “Against that background, we have decided to accept an extremely lucrative bid from Chelsea,” Zorc said. The fee — more than three times the amount Wolfsburg paid Hertha Berlin for John Brooks, the German-born U.S. international, in 2017 — makes Pulisic the third most expensive player in Chelsea’s history, and the third most expensive player ever purchased from a Bundesliga team. It represents something of a success for Dortmund given that Pulisic has started just five of the team’s Bundesliga fixtures this season, having recovered from injury to find the likes of Jadon Sancho and Jacob Bruun Larsen blocking his path. He has started more regularly in the Champions League, featuring in all but one of Dortmund’s group games as the German team qualified with ease for the competition’s last 16. For Chelsea, though, Pulisic’s appeal had not faded. Aside from the likely marketing benefits of employing the most high-profile American player of his generation, Marina Granovskaia, the director who oversees the Premier League team’s transfer activity, described the signing as something of a coup for Pulisic’s on-field qualities. “Christian has shown his quality during a fantastic spell in Germany and at just 20, we believe he has the potential to become an important Chelsea player for many years to come,” Granovskaia said. “We look forward to welcoming him to Stamford Bridge in the summer and wish him and Dortmund every success for the remainder of the season.” Pulisic described the chance to sign for such a “legendary club” as a “privilege,” and said he “looked forward to being a contributor to their team of world-class players.” Whether Chelsea’s most obviously world-class player — Eden Hazard — remains in place when Pulisic arrives, though, remains open to question. The Belgian has admitted on several occasions that he is tempted by the prospect of a move to Real Madrid at the end of the season, though he has not agreed terms with the Spanish team and Real have not so much as submitted an offer to Chelsea, let alone had a bid accepted. Even if Hazard — whose contract also expires in 2020 — chooses to stay, the signing of Pulisic is likely to herald the departure of Willian and/or Pedro, despite the fact that Sarri has increasingly relied on playing both of them as he seeks to earn a place in the Champions League in his first year in charge at Stamford Bridge. Both are now in their 30s — Chelsea has a policy of not offering long deals to players approaching the end of their careers — and will be out of contract in 2020, too. Though Pulisic is not necessarily a like-for-like replacement for any of them, his arrival suggests Chelsea is starting to contemplate a long-anticipated overhaul of its squad as it seeks a way to keep pace with the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool.

sport Hold the Coronation: Manchester City Is No Longer Unbeaten - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Hold the Coronation: Manchester City Is No Longer Unbeaten Supported by On Soccer Hold the Coronation: Manchester City Is No Longer Unbeaten Image Chelsea’s N’Golo Kanté scored his team’s first goal against Manchester City in their Premier League game on Saturday. Chelsea won, 2-0.CreditCreditEddie Keogh/Reuters By Rory Smith Dec. 8, 2018 LONDON — For 44 minutes, Chelsea chased. Dutifully, doggedly, Maurizio Sarri’s players trailed after Manchester City, after the ball. They tracked runs. They shuttled from one side of the Stamford Bridge field to the other. They cleared crosses and intercepted passes, and they thumped the ball away, as far as it would go. Then they caught their breath, strained their sinews and got ready to do it all again. The previous day, as he outlined the significance of this game, Pep Guardiola had made the slightest of slips of the tongue. “We play five hypothetical strong teams in the league, and Chelsea is the last one,” the Manchester City coach said. What he meant, of course, was abundantly clear: Theoretically, there are five Premier League teams who would pretend to be Manchester City’s equal. But — written down, devoid of intonation and context — it took on another meaning: that those teams are rather stronger in theory than they are in practice. That is, certainly, the way City had made it look thus far. It has already won, comfortably, at Arsenal and eased past Tottenham at the Spurs’ temporary home at Wembley. It took a point at Anfield, against Liverpool, and would have won had Riyad Mahrez converted a late penalty. Manchester United — the only one of its peers City has faced at home — was dispatched, easily, a few weeks ago. And for 44 minutes on Saturday, it looked as if Chelsea would go exactly the same way. There is only so long any team can resist the Premier League champion, after all. Sooner or later, Guardiola’s players find a way through. “They always find the spaces,” as Javi Gracia, the Watford manager, said after losing to City last Tuesday. True, Chelsea was putting up greater resistance than most. For all of City’s slick possession in the first half, for all its effortless dominance, it could create only glimmers of chances: a Raheem Sterling shot hungrily clutched by Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper; Antonio Rudiger blocking an effort from David Silva with his goalkeeper beaten; Cesar Azpilicueta hurling himself in the way to deny Leroy Sane. So apparent was City’s superiority, though, that a breakthrough seemed inevitable. It was treating Chelsea — a team that had, until just a few weeks ago, been unbeaten in the Premier League; a team packed full of Premier League champions; a team that boasts Eden Hazard, arguably the most gifted player in England — like all of those midtable also-rans it swats aside with such contemptuous ease. City would, eventually, find the spaces; City would, eventually, score; and it would, eventually, return to the top of the Premier League, a few hours after being dethroned, temporarily, by Liverpool, the last of its challengers to fade. But then came the 45th minute and Chelsea’s first meaningful attack of the game — a clever, if slightly hopeful, cutback from Hazard, and an unerring finish from N’Golo Kanté, the most dutiful, most dogged chaser of them all. Stamford Bridge, pushed into near silence by City’s precision, came alive. And so, too, did the Premier League title race. A few weeks ago, Guardiola traveled to Liverpool — hostile territory, in theory — to give a talk to the city’s university. He was asked, in a brief question-and-answer session after the formal discussion, what he liked to read. Image Pep Guardiola was left dejected on Saturday as his Manchester City team lost for the first time this season — to Chelsea.CreditWill Oliver/EPA, via Shutterstock Guardiola has, from childhood, been a voracious reader. He was obsessed, as a teenager, with a book by Albert Cohen, “Bella del Senor’’; he counts the author David Trueba as a friend and has given Trueba’s work to many of his players. Now, although he keeps a “nice library,” he said in Liverpool that he finds he only has time to read poetry. Anything longer, and after a while, his mind starts to drift. “I think, ‘Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp,’ and I cannot focus,” he said on stage. At the time, his comments seemed to reflect either the restlessness of the obsessive or a man generously playing to the crowd. Few seriously felt that Klopp, and Liverpool, were likely to strain City too much. All of City’s other challengers had already fallen: Arsenal almost immediately and Manchester United only a little later. Tottenham had given away ground early on: too much, surely, to claw back. Chelsea had lasted until November before stumbling. Liverpool deserved praise for being the last team standing, but though it was unbeaten, its performances had been far from convincing. It was clinging to City — admirably — but Guardiola’s team looked too smooth, too strong, too good. At some point, City would race off into the distance. It seemed to be competing only with history, driven only by its own determination to beat its own records. “People said we were invincible, we were perfect, we would win the league in February,” Guardiola reflected on Saturday night. “But you said that, not me.” Manchester City is, of course, still the favorite to win the Premier League; it will still take a remarkable season from Liverpool to deny Guardiola a second consecutive championship. But Kanté’s goal — and then a header from David Luiz that secured Chelsea’s 2-0 victory on Saturday and ended City’s 21-game unbeaten run — has brought doubt where there was only certainty. City’s procession to the title has turned into a race. There was no blueprint in Saturday’s game for others to follow. Chelsea did not identify a frailty in the machine that Guardiola has built, some sort of glitch in the algorithm. Instead, this was the sort of triumph that was, if not unique to Chelsea, then certainly something of a specialty in west London. It was a victory for all those old virtues — tenacity and industry and a refusal to wilt — that this club acquired a long time ago, in the first reign of Jose Mourinho, and that it has somehow been able to transfer from generation to generation. It is not the sort of thing that Everton can mimic next week when it plays City, or that other managers can hope to copy and paste to their own team. But it gives just enough hope to everyone else that there is a way that City might be stopped, if not from winning the Premier League, then certainly from making a mockery of the English conceit that its top division alone is immune to domination. For most of the first half of this season, City has set an almost unbearable pace. Before Saturday, before Stamford Bridge, it had dropped just four points and found itself trailing in a game for just 12 minutes. And yet, now, it is Liverpool — thanks to a 4-0 win at Bournemouth earlier in the day — that sits atop the Premier League. It is Klopp’s team that remains unbeaten. And it is Manchester City — the reigning champion and the champion-elect, the team that has made even the strong look weak — that is chasing. For now, at least.

sport Tarik Cohen Makes Football Fun Again in Chicago - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Tarik Cohen Makes Football Fun Again in Chicago Supported by Tarik Cohen Makes Football Fun Again in Chicago Image Running back Tarik Cohen led the Bears with 71 receptions this season.CreditCreditBen Solomon for The New York Times By Ben Shpigel Jan. 3, 2019 LAKE FOREST, Ill. — During practice last Thursday afternoon, Tarik Cohen caught a punt. Still clutching the ball, he proceeded to catch another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. By the end of this wacky experiment, Cohen was cradling seven balls — one, roughly, for every role he has with the Chicago Bears. Cohen is — O.K., deep breath — the Bears’ handoff-taking, punt-returning, ball-catching, pass-throwing, mismatch-creating, gasp-inducing, highlight-monopolizing cyborg. A year after becoming the first rookie since Gale Sayers, a former Bear, in 1965, to contribute touchdowns by running, receiving, passing and punt return, Cohen has further obliterated concerns that a 5-foot-6 running back from the humble Football Championship Subdivision would struggle transitioning to the N.F.L.’s rugged N.F.C. North. [Wild-Card Weekend: Our Predictions for the N.F.L. Playoffs] If the quarterback-wrecking edge rusher Khalil Mack embodies a defense that has fueled the Bears’ worst-to-first ascent — as the N.F.C.’s third seed, they’ll face the No. 6-seeded Eagles in the wild-card round on Sunday, their first playoff appearance since 2010 — Cohen personifies the offense installed by the team’s first-year coach, Matt Nagy: creative, unpredictable and, at times, downright fun. Nagy has maximized Cohen’s speed, suddenness and receiving skills by aligning him around the formation, from the backfield to the inside to the outside, turning him into, in effect, Chicago’s offensive version of Mack: the player opponents must stalk wherever he is on the field. He led the team in catches (71), yards from scrimmage (1,169) and all-purpose yardage (1,599), and was voted onto the All-Pro team as punt returner. “He’s got a lot of strengths and not a lot of weaknesses,” Nagy said. “Having him be a part of what we do and what we scheme is a huge advantage.” Soon after the Bears hired Nagy away from Kansas City, where he served for five seasons on Andy Reid’s staff, Cohen heard that last season the Chiefs featured three players who gained more than 1,000 yards: receiver Tyreek Hill, tight end Travis Kelce and running back Kareem Hunt. Cohen did not know when or how he would get the ball in Chicago, he said, only that he would. “Get me the ball and get me in space,” Cohen said. That just might be his motto. His 170 touches rank second on the team, behind Jordan Howard, the primary rusher. As a runner, Cohen has the seventh-best breakaway percentage in the N.F.L., gaining 44.4 percent of his 444 yards on carries of at least 15 yards, according to Pro Football Focus. As a receiver, Cohen averages 10.2 yards per reception, most among the 20 backs with at least 40 catches, according to Pro Football Reference. As the position has evolved, a hybridized strain of running back has permeated the league, players as comfortable with, and capable of, lining up in the slot or being split wide as they are rushing 20 times per game. Cohen does not run as often as other versatile second-year dynamos like the Panthers’ Christian McCaffrey or the Saints’ Alvin Kamara, but his proficiency in the passing game — his 175 snaps away from the backfield were the most among running backs — has made him, according to Pro Football Focus’s Wins Above Replacement metric, the second-most valuable player at his position, just behind McCaffrey. “I don’t think there’s anything he can’t do,” Bears running back Benny Cunningham said. The Bears’ vast playbook — Minnesota Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer quipped earlier this season that it contained 800 plays — demands Cohen know entire passing concepts because any week he could line up at four or five different spots. His first-year position coach, Charles London, marveled early on at Cohen’s savvy — how he can see a drawing or a video of a play and master his responsibilities on the field in a repetition or two. His improvement as a blocker has helped Chicago disguise its calls, diminishing tendencies that his alignment might have tipped off. “There’s not really a route — at running back or receiver — that he can’t run in this offense,” London said. That was Cohen’s objective during the off-season, he said, when he devoted two days a week to refining routes that come back to the ball, like curls, during seven-on-seven drills with his former North Carolina A&T teammates. He did not want to be branded as only a deep-ball threat, just as he does not want to be perceived as strictly a perimeter runner, someone unwilling — or worse, not stout enough — to run between the tackles. Further evidence: Ask Cohen his top play from this season, and he mentions not the 70-yard screen against the Jets, the 50-yard catch-and-dash at Miami or the overtime-forcing touchdown toss at the Giants. In his mind, all the feints, cutbacks and bursts that evoke his favorite player, Reggie Bush, do not compare to the punt he fielded midway through the first quarter against New England in Week 7, when he stepped left, cut right, then zipped left again, shedding a tackle at his feet before encountering a defender by the boundary squaring up to level him. The contact was brief. The defender crumpled. Cohen did not. “Somebody so small running somebody big over — it makes everybody’s day,” Cohen said. Image Cohen celebrated with Charles Leno Jr. after a touchdown against the Dolphins.CreditMarc Serota/Getty Images Cohen is short but, listed at 181 pounds, not small. He is thick and sturdy, with disproportionately enormous hands — size 10⅛ from thumb to pinkie, bigger than those of hulking receiving threats like Kelce, Julio Jones and A.J. Green — that help him do things like, say, hold on to seven balls at the same time. Growing up in rural Bunn, N.C., about 30 miles northeast of Raleigh, Cohen specialized in such exploits. For one, he developed his speed — like another Bears playmaker before him — through unorthodox methods. Instead of running through tall, thick grass, as Devin Hester did, Cohen dodged the pit bulls that he said roamed his neighborhood. “It’s fight or flight,” Cohen said. “Either get going or you’re going to get eat, so you’ve got to get out of there.” He did get out of there — to play football, but barely. Had North Carolina A&T, a historically black university, not offered him a scholarship, Cohen would have joined the Navy. Why? “I knew how to swim,” said Cohen, sitting in the Halas Hall lobby before practice one day last week. “And it wasn’t like people were getting killed in the Navy.” Rather than enlist, Cohen opted to dominate the F.C.S. Across his four seasons at A&T, he rushed for a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference record 5,619 yards, the 10th-most in the history of what was formerly Division I-AA. But when N.F.L. scouts passed through Greensboro, said Shawn Gibbs, his position coach at A&T, some seemed unconvinced. “They just tried to poke holes in everything he did — like, he’s good, but,” Gibbs said. “The guys that were like: ‘Man, this guy can walk under this table. I can’t take him to my G.M.’ Those were the guys that were frustrating.” It was the Bears’ good fortune that their scout who prowls the Southeast, Sam Summerville, attended a historically black college himself. Before even studying Cohen, Summerville admired him as a fan, watching from afar as he rushed for 295 yards — and touchdowns of 74, 83 and 73 yards — against Alcorn State in the Celebration Bowl. The deeper he probed, the more Summerville believed in Cohen. Not as a gadget player, but as an N.F.L. running back. At Summerville’s urging, the Bears deployed additional scouts to evaluate him, and they, too, grew enamored. Still, as they prepped for the 2017 draft, Summerville expected pushback — for everything from Cohen’s statistics, perceived to be inflated by the lesser competition, to his stature. So he relied on emotion as much as reason to convey why they needed him. In an impassioned plea, Summerville showed his colleagues the clip of Cohen catching two balls while doing a back flip. (Yes, really.) He affirmed that rival coaches feared no player more than Cohen. He explained that of the 350 to 400 players he assessed in the fall of 2016, Cohen was “definitely” his favorite. “It got to the point where some of the other scouts may have been rolling their eyes a little bit, like, ‘this guy’s serious,’” Summerville said. “Every time I opened my mouth about him, or every time a question was asked, they were like, ‘Do you think this guy can do this?’ Tarik can do pretty much everything you ask him to.” The Bears chose Cohen with one of their fourth-round selections — they took another foundational player, safety Eddie Jackson, seven picks earlier — and before he even took a snap, Cunningham exhorted his friends to draft him for their fantasy football teams. Many satisfied customers, he said. Over the summer, Summerville reviewed his reports on Cohen, to check whether reality matched projections. It did not. Cohen surpassed them. One after another after another after another. And another.

Steinbrenner Field.CreditCreditKathy Willens/Associated Press By Field Level Media Dec. 14, 2018 Joan Steinbrenner, a philanthropist and vice-chairwoman of the Yankees and the widow of George Steinbrenner, who had a tumultuous but hugely successful run as the team’s principal owner and chairman, died on Tuesday at her home in Tampa, Fla. She was 83. The Steinbrenner family announced the death in a statement. Mrs. Steinbrenner supported many philanthropic organizations over the years. In her native Ohio, she worked with the Cleveland Orchestra and the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center. In Florida, she was named state chairwoman for the Special Olympics held there in 1981 and 1982 and at various times sat on the boards of the National Society to Prevent Blindness, the St. Joseph’s Hospitals Foundation in Tampa, the Children’s Home Network in Tampa and the Florida Orchestra. Elizabeth Joan (pronounced jo-ann) Zieg was born on Aug. 25, 1935, in Mount Vernon, Ohio. She graduated from Upper Arlington High School in Columbus and Ohio State University, earning a degree in dental hygiene. She met Mr. Steinbrenner, a fellow Ohio native who was five years her senior, while he was doing postgraduate studies at Ohio State. They married in 1956. Mr. Steinbrenner led a group that purchased the Yankees in 1973. Brusque and tempestuous, often sparring with managers and players, he put a formidable stamp on the team as it won 11 pennants and seven World Series championships and grew rich. Forbes estimates its worth at $3.7 billion, making it the most valuable franchise in baseball. He died in 2010 at 80. Ms. Steinbrenner is survived by her four children, Hal, Hank, Jennifer and Jessica Steinbrenner, who are the club’s current general partners; 14 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

sport ‘We Came Here to Win’: Mets Unveil Cano and Diaz - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|‘We Came Here to Win’: Mets Unveil Cano and Diaz Supported by ‘We Came Here to Win’: Mets Unveil Cano and Diaz Image The Mets introduced Robinson Cano and Edwin Diaz on Tuesday at Citi Field.CreditCreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times By James Wagner Dec. 4, 2018 Edwin Diaz was at home in his native Puerto Rico last week when buzz about a potential blockbuster trade that would send him and his Seattle Mariners’ teammate, Robinson Cano, to the Mets fluttered across social media. By Friday, the trade was in mostly in place. That night, Cano, who was in his native Dominican Republic, called Diaz. “Be ready,” Cano told Diaz. “We’re going to New York. We’re going to have fun over there, win games and help the team.” On Monday, Cano, a second baseman, and Diaz, a relief pitcher, were in New York for their physicals and dinner with the Mets’ brass, including the owners, front office staff and Manager Mickey Callaway. The next morning, the players were formally introduced as the Mets’ new stars — completing a splashy, albeit risky, move that signaled the team’s commitment to contending for a playoff spot in 2019 after back-to-back losing seasons. “We did not make this move to have this be our last move,” the Mets’ general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen, said just over a month into his new job. Before he was hired in October, Van Wagenen was an agent who had represented, among other players, Cano. The trade was both bold and precarious for various reasons. The National League East is getting tougher by the minute: the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Nationals, who reached a deal with the top free agent starter Patrick Corbin on Tuesday, are all improving. The Mets mortgaged part of their future by giving up three prospects — including two first-round draft picks in outfielder Jarred Kelenic and pitcher Justin Dunn — and absorbed $100 million of the contract that Cano, 36, signed with the Mariners in order to acquire him and Diaz, 24. Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer and a co-owner of the team, called the trade “pretty neutral” in terms of dollars for 2019 for three reasons: The Mets unloaded $36.5 million (the amount owed to underperforming veteran players, outfielder Jay Bruce and relief pitcher Anthony Swarzak) from their payroll; they received $20 million from the Mariners; and Diaz is relatively inexpensive now. Questions will linger about the new acquisitions, though. The Mets took on the five remaining years on Cano’s contract, which will expire when he is 40. He played only 80 games last season because of a fractured hand and an 80-game suspension related to a positive test for a banned substance. Cano declined to address the suspension when asked on Tuesday, saying that he already had discussed it during the season and wanted to focus on the positive. Van Wagenen knows the details of the episode but would not specifically address it beyond saying that Cano was suspended for a diuretic and not a performance-enhancing drug. Cano was indeed caught using furosemide, a diuretic he said last season was given by a doctor for a medical condition, but it is sometimes used to hide the presence of other banned substances. Under baseball’s drug policy, a player who tests positive for a diuretic is suspended if he cannot prove that he used it for legitimate purposes or if league officials determine the intent was to use it as a masking agent. “If I had any concern about Robby’s physical state or performance ability going forward, I would not have made the deal,” Van Wagenen said. Image Cano joined players like Diaz, left, and Corey Oswalt, right, in handing out gifts to children during the Mets’ annual kids holiday party on Tuesday.CreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times Wilpon said he was “very comfortable” with the explanation Van Wagenen gave him regarding Cano’s suspension but declined to elaborate. “I could be proven wrong, but I don’t think he’s a drug cheat,” Wilpon said of Cano. Regardless, Cano’s power and defense at second base, where he won Gold Gloves in 2010 and 2012, have declined some over the years, but he still hit .303 with an .845 on-base-slugging-percentage last season — production that could have helped the Mets’ streaky offense. Cano said he felt younger than 36 and that he is capable of competing against younger players. He pointed to David Ortiz and his former Yankees teammates Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez as examples of those who played at 40. (Not all were productive at that age and some played under a cloud of performance-enhancing drug usage.) “You’re not going to be the same guy when you get to 40 as 25,” Cano said. “Your body is so different. But I will say this: If you work hard and always prepare yourself, like other guys did in the past, you’ll be able to play at that level.” Cano, an eight-time All-Star, said it was easier to waive his no-trade clause knowing he would be reunited with Van Wagenen, but he also cited his love for New York, the passion for baseball here and the chance to compete for a title again. “He has a vision on his legacy,” Van Wagenen said. “He has a mission in mind that he wants to define his career the next five years as much as he has over the course of the last 10.” Although relief pitchers can be volatile from year to year, the Mets believe Diaz’s age, four years of control and cost relative to older free agent relief pitchers outweighs any decline in Cano’s performance. “When you start as high as Robby Cano did, that decline is pretty valuable and as good as anything we have in the organization,” Van Wagenen said. The Mets believe their window to win is for the next few seasons, while pitchers Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard, who is unlikely to be traded, and outfielders Brandon Nimmo and Michael Conforto are all in the same uniform. Van Wagenen called Diaz the best closer in baseball. Diaz, whose fastball reaches 100 miles per hour, showed promise before a breakout 2018, which he attributed to an improved competitive mentality. He had a major league-high 57 saves while posting a 1.96 E.R.A., striking out 124 over 73⅓ innings, and earning his first All-Star nod. Diaz said a bone spur, which was discovered in his throwing arm when he was drafted in 2012, has never been an issue. He said he was impressed the Mets gave up three prospects to acquire Cano and him. “We came here to win and try to reach the World Series and get a ring,” he said.

sport Adrian Beltre Was the All-Time Great You Failed to Notice - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Adrian Beltre Was the All-Time Great You Failed to Notice Supported by Keeping Score Adrian Beltre Was the All-Time Great You Failed to Notice Image Adrian Beltre retired on Tuesday after 21 seasons. He is widely regarded as one of the best third basemen in major league history.CreditCreditGregory Shamus/Getty Images By Benjamin Hoffman Nov. 20, 2018 Adrian Beltre does not like to have his head touched. That’s an odd thing to focus on when considering Beltre, who announced his retirement on Tuesday and will almost assuredly be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but watch one of the many videos of his reaction to even the slightest contact and you’ll understand. CreditCreditVideo by Alex Delije Once you get past that quirk to end all quirks and really dig into Beltre’s 21-year career, you will find that one of the greatest third baseman to ever walk the planet was hiding in plain sight all along. With Beltre, you have the big traditional numbers: 3,166 hits, 477 home runs, 1,707 runs batted in. You have the awards: five Gold Gloves, four Silver Sluggers, four top-10 Most Valuable Player Award finishes. And you even have an outrageous advanced statistic: 95.7 career wins above replacement, which trailed only Albert Pujols among active players before Tuesday’s announcement. By the statistic JAWS, which was developed by Jay Jaffe, author of “The Cooperstown Casebook,” in an effort to capture a player’s overall talent as well as the explosiveness of his peak, Beltre ranks as the fourth greatest third baseman in major league history, behind only Mike Schmidt, Eddie Mathews and Wade Boggs. It may seems crazy to rank Beltre above such luminaries as Brooks Robinson and Chipper Jones, but Schmidt said that distinction might not go far enough for Beltre. “How about Beltre?” Schmidt said in March. “First-ballot guy, kind of hid in the weeds most of his career. Isn’t he now a 3,000-hit guy? He’s gotta be considered past me in terms of the greatest of all-time.” Image Beltre hit 477 home runs in his career despite spending his first 12 seasons in pitchers’ parks. He made up for lost time once he got to a hitters’ park with the Texas Rangers.CreditMichael Ainsworth/Associated Press “He’ll bypass me,” Schmidt added. “Why not? He wins a Gold Glove every year and hits 40 every year; that’s better than me.” The most underappreciated aspects of Beltre’s mastery of the game were his longevity, his defensive prowess, and the parks in which he spent much of his career. His 2,933 career games ranks just ahead of Robinson for 14th all-time and his 11,068 at-bats rank eighth. He was a major league regular by the time he was 19 — it was determined after he had made the majors that the Los Angeles Dodgers had improperly signed him a year too early, which resulted in several suspensions as well as the team being forced to pay Beltre damages — and was still an above average player at 39. “I remember one time I was going to give him a day off, and we’re on the field and he just could not help himself,” Ron Washington, one of Beltre’s managers with the Texas Rangers, said in an interview on MLB Network Radio on Tuesday. “I’ve never told anyone this story, but I said, ‘Adrian, I’m going to kneel down here, I’m begging you to take the day off. People don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m on my knees begging you to take the day off.’ That was the only way I got him to take the day off — I actually got on my knees.” Beltre finally relented. “And you know that resonated with everyone in that clubhouse,” Washington said, “because no one wanted to take a day off, simply because they watched Adrian.” Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Beltre’s durability is that he kept himself on the field at such an advanced age thanks in large part to his glove. Defense can be hard to quantify, as the more modern statistics have only been tracked since the early 2000s, but using the best methods available from each season, Baseball-Reference credits Beltre with 23.1 career defensive WAR at third base, which trails only Robinson, who had 39.1 using far less precise methods of measurement. Image Little changed over the years for Beltre, in terms of fielding. He showed off unusual range even as a 19- and 20-year-old with the Los Angeles Dodgers.CreditMark J. Terrill/Associated Press Since 2003, when Sports Info Solutions started tracking defensive runs saved, a hybrid of scouting and stats that provides far more context for a player’s abilities, Beltre stands alone. His 222 runs saved are not only the most among third basemen — Scott Rolen is second at 114 and Nolan Arenado has 109 — but they are the most of a player at any position, as he holds a 38-D.R.S. lead over Andrelton Simmons, the Wizard-like shortstop of the Los Angeles Angels (though, in fairness to Simmons, Beltre had nine more years in the D.R.S. era to compile those numbers). Beltre’s eye-popping runs saved numbers are a reflection of his ability to make any kind of play in the field. In one four-season span, Sports Info Solutions rated him as the best third baseman in baseball at turning balls hit down the third base line into outs, and in an entirely separate three-season span, he was the best third baseman at turning balls hit in the shortstop-third base hole into outs, according to that company’s plus-minus system. “He was able to be great going in one direction without sacrificing excellence going in the other direction,” Mark Simon, a senior researcher for Sports Info Solutions, said in an email. All of that leaves Beltre’s 3,000 hits as a middle-of-the-order slugger as something of an afterthought. But even as a batter, with easier to understand statistics, Beltre may be underappreciated. To get an idea of why, you have to consider where Beltre spent the first 12 seasons of his career. He started at Dodger Stadium, which played as a pitchers’ park in all seven seasons he was there, and then he moved to Seattle’s Safeco Field, a notoriously difficult park where home runs go to die on the warning track. As a result, he spent the first 13 years of his career performing far better on the road than he did at home, with the most extreme season being 2001, when his on-base-plus-slugging percentage on the road was 200 points higher than his percentage at home. Beltre may have spent the last eight years of his career in the Rangers’ hitter-friendly park, but he still finished his career with more hits, home runs and R.B.I. on the road than he had at home, and his .818 road O.P.S. is the 19th highest of any player who compiled 5,000 or more at-bats away from home, ahead of Hall of Fame infielders like Cal Ripken Jr., Derek Jeter and Paul Molitor. When you add all of it together, Beltre easily backs up Schmidt’s praise. And in five years, it will be no surprise when he walks across the stage in Cooperstown as the newest Hall of Fame inductee. Hopefully no one will touch his head. Tyler Kepner contributed reporting.

Darnold has been out since Nov. 4 with a sprained right foot. He returned to practice this week, but only in a limited fashion. Jets coach Todd Bowles did not think he had enough practice time to play against the Titans, so he went with Josh McCown, who lost his third straight start. “He could have played,” Bowles said of Darnold. “He just needed more reps. You just can’t bring him back after 14 to 17 days. Even if he’s healthy, to not have timing and everything else and put him out there [Sunday] in a game like this. We’ll reload this week and see where he is.” Bowles said it was too early to know if Darnold will play against Buffalo. McCown was 17-of-30 for 128 yards and one interception in the game. The Jets offense had another dismal day, failing to reach the end zone. The Jets have scored three offensive touchdowns in their last five games. The five-game stretch of scoring one or no touchdowns in a game is a franchise record, according to ESPN. see also Jets report card: A disaster in every spot but one Grades from the Jets’ 26-22 loss to the Titans on... Offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates has been a disaster in his first year on the job. The players seem fed up, but are still biting their tongues. Wide receiver Quincy Enunwa had just two catches for 9 yards and did not want to touch the question of what ails the offense. “I still have a job right now,” Enunwa said. “As much as I’d love to say what my opinion of that is, I’d rather just keep that to myself.” Yikes. Titans WR Taywan Taylor, who wears No. 13, had catches of 55 yards and 44 yards in the fourth quarter. Jets CB Buster Skrine did not seem impressed. “I think it was number 13 running the deep ball. I think that was the only thing he could run, a one-trick pony,” Skrine said. “They did a good job just getting the ball to him down the field.” Kicker Jason Myers became the first kicker in Jets history to hit at least five field goals in a game twice in the same season. … LB Kevin Pierre-Louis blocked a punt in the second quarter, the team’s first blocked punt since Antonio Allen blocked one against the Raiders on Dec. 8 2013. … DE Henry Anderson blocked an extra point in the second quarter. It was the first one the Jets have blocked since 2009 when DE Bryan Thomas blocked one against the Colts. OL Spencer Long, who started last week at left guard, did not play in the game due to an illness. Dakota Dozier started at left guard, his first start of the season. James Carpenter, the usual starter at left guard, was placed on IR this week with a shoulder injury.

sport A Baseball Trivia Quiz for the Holidays (and Rickey Henderson’s Birthday) - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Baseball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Baseball|A Baseball Trivia Quiz for the Holidays (and Rickey Henderson’s Birthday) Supported by On Baseball A Baseball Trivia Quiz for the Holidays (and Rickey Henderson’s Birthday) Image Rickey Henderson, shown here in 1990, turns 60 on Christmas Day. Ten percent of this quiz is about him.CreditCreditElise Amendola/Associated Press By Tyler Kepner Dec. 23, 2018 Like so many stories involving the greatest player ever born on Christmas, this story might be apocryphal. But as Rickey Henderson tales go, it sounds plausible to me. As I heard it — from my fellow Mets beat writers in 2000, the year I joined The New York Times — the Mets decided to have some fun with players’ walk-up music one day in 1999. For a few precious seconds as each hitter strode to the plate, the Shea Stadium loudspeakers would play the No. 1 song in the country the day that hitter was born. The inimitable Henderson, then the Mets’ left fielder, was born on Dec. 25, 1958. The No. 1 song that day happened to be “The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don’t Be Late),” a novelty tune by The Chipmunks with David Seville that won three Grammys with its distinctive falsetto sound. It’s a cute song, but decidedly not one that Henderson — or anyone, really — would choose to follow his name at a major league ballpark. Apparently Henderson vented about this to the writers after the game, using the third person — as he loved to do — while insisting that Rickey was no Chipmunks fan and did not like cartoon rodents introducing a player of his stature. Oh, how I wish I’d been there to record that little rant for posterity. Anyway, in honor of Henderson, here’s our second Christmas baseball trivia quiz, featuring sections on Rickey and two of his many former teams, the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers, who met in the last World Series. There’s also a section on strikeouts, after the first season in history with more strikeouts than hits, and a few other topics you might enjoy. Image The Chipmunks’ Christmas song became Henderson’s walkup music one day at Shea Stadium. He was not merry about that.CreditDamian Dovarganes/Associated Press Last year’s quiz featured 50 questions in honor of Houston Astros pitcher Charlie Morton, who wore No. 50 while winning the 2017 World Series clincher. Now we present 50 more questions in honor of Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts, who homered in the 2018 World Series clincher while — quite conveniently — wearing No. 50.

sport Gary Woodland Keeps 3-Stroke Lead at Tournament of Champions - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Gary Woodland Keeps 3-Stroke Lead at Tournament of Champions Supported by Gary Woodland Keeps 3-Stroke Lead at Tournament of Champions Image Gary Woodland after making an eagle putt on the 15th hole Saturday in the third round of the Tournament of Champions.CreditCreditSam Greenwood/Getty Images By The Associated Press Jan. 5, 2019 KAPALUA, Hawaii — Gary Woodland made a 65-foot eagle putt and finished with a birdie for a five-under-par 68 to keep his three-shot lead in the Tournament of Champions on Saturday. Rory McIlroy briefly caught him for the lead until the birdies stopped falling. He shot 68 and will play in the final group on Sunday. They were tied late in the third round when McIlroy missed a good birdie chance on two par-5s at No. 15 and No. 18. Woodland reached the front of the 15th green and watched his putt up the slope and into the grain drop for eagle, with the pin still in the hole. He holed a 12-foot birdie putt on the toughest pin position at the 18th — front and right — to end the day at 17-under 202. Image Rory McIlroy at the 18th tee.CreditSam Greenwood/Getty Images Marc Leishman, who made a double bogey in the opening round and a triple bogey on Friday, limited the damage to only one bogey. He had a 68 and was well in range, four shots behind. Xander Schauffele (68) and Bryson DeChambeau (70) were five back. McIlroy got through his round without a bogey. He had a close call on the 16th, when he tried to atone for the missed birdie on the previous hole by going at the flag and landing just over the green. He faced one of the fastest chips on the course, down the slope toward the Pacific horizon, and left it 12 feet short. He made his par to at least stay in range. “I probably pushed a little too hard, and it didn’t really work out for me,” McIlroy said. “I just have to go about my business. I didn’t make a bogey today, so I’ll make that a goal tomorrow.” The outcome still will depend on Woodland, a three-time winner on the PGA Tour. His only mistake on Saturday was coming up just short of the green on No. 12 and missing a 5-foot par putt. Woodland was part of a crowded leaderboard Friday when he pulled away with five straight birdies. This time, all he needed was one big putt. He laughed when it dropped, although he said it had nothing to do with surprise. “I just saw somebody’s face in the background. They weren’t too happy that the ball went in, so it made me laugh,” he said. “I enjoyed that.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Late Surge Keeps Woodland in Lead.

sport Cowboys Outlast the Seahawks in a Hard-Fought Wild-Card Playoff - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Cowboys Outlast the Seahawks in a Hard-Fought Wild-Card Playoff Supported by Cowboys 24, Seahawks 22 Cowboys Outlast the Seahawks in a Hard-Fought Wild-Card Playoff Image Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott passed for 226 yards and a touchdown and also scored on a 1-yard run in a playoff win against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday.CreditCreditMike Stone/EPA, via Shutterstock By The Associated Press Jan. 5, 2019 ARLINGTON, Tex. — Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott saw an opening up the middle, then three defenders between him and the first down. He found a way to get there, and to get his first playoff victory two years after his sensational rookie season ended in postseason disappointment. Ezekiel Elliott rushed for 137 yards and the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter, Prescott scored on a sneak after his dazzling head-over-heels run, and the Cowboys hung on for a 24-22 wild-card win over the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday night. [Read: Cowboys Hitch Playoff Wagon to Dak Prescott’s Shoulders] The win was the first for Elliott and Prescott after losing a divisional game to Green Bay as rookie stars two years ago. Dallas will play either the New Orleans Saints or the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round next weekend. The loss ended a run of nine straight victories in playoff openers for the Seahawks. The Elias Sports Bureau says it was the longest such streak in N.F.L. history. Leading by 17-14, Prescott faced third-and-14 from the Seattle 17 with the two-minute warning approaching. He took off up the middle on a draw, barged through a trio of defenders six yards short of the first down and went down at the 1 when he was flipped headfirst by safety Tedric Thompson. Prescott scored on the next play. “He’s just a rare guy,” Dallas Coach Jason Garrett said. “His leadership, his toughness, just his way, his spirit. It’s like none other. Somehow, some way, he’s going to figure this thing out for us.” The Dallas defense, ranked in the top 10 most of the season, stifled the N.F.L.’s No. 1 rushing offense and largely kept quarterback Russell Wilson under control while handing him his first loss in four wild-card games. “Our defense was great,” Prescott said. “They keep us in every game.” It was the eighth win in nine games for the Cowboys. Prescott threw for 226 yards on 22-of-33 passing. His sneak with 2 minutes 8 seconds left appeared to be a clinching score, giving Dallas a 24-14 lead at the end of a drive that burned more than five minutes. But a 53-yard catch by Tyler Lockett set up a quick Seattle touchdown — Wilson’s 7-yard scoring pass to J.D. McKissic. Chris Carson rushed for the 2-point conversion, the Seahawks’ second of the game, making the score 24-22. The Seahawks’ options were limited because they were missing kicker Sebastian Janikowski, who got hurt on a wide 57-yard field-goal attempt at the end of the first half. With just 1:18 to go in the game and no timeouts left, Seattle had to attempt an onside kick. Punter Michael Dickson’s drop kick was caught by Cole Beasley at the Dallas 31, sealing the first playoff win for the Cowboys since they beat Detroit in the wild-card round in the 2014 season. Seattle took a 14-10 lead late in the third quarter after Wilson ran for 4 yards for a touchdown and Mike Davis delivered a 2-point conversion run. Then Prescott led a 67-yard drive to put the Cowboys back in front for good, 17-14. A 34-yard pass to Amari Cooper, who had seven catches for 106 yards, led to Elliott’s 1-yard plunge after an apparent touchdown by the quarterback was overturned on replay. On the next Dallas possession, Prescott had a chance to give the Cowboys a 10-point lead, but K.J. Wright made a juggling interception in the end zone. The Dallas defense came through again, though, forcing a punt. On the Dallas drive, Elliott, the N.F.L. rushing leader, stiff-armed Shaquill Griffin on a 17-yard run to get inside the 20 and help set up Prescott’s big draw play. The Seahawks took their first lead of the game in part because they had lost the 40-year-old Janikowski. Facing fourth-and-5 (in Janikowski’s range) from the Dallas 39, Doug Baldwin made a toe-dragging catch on the sideline for 22 yards. That helped set up Wilson’s touchdown run. But the Cowboys never did lose control of the Seattle running game after allowing Chris Carson’s first career 100-yard game in a Week 3 loss to the Seahawks. Carson had just 20 yards on 13 carries. Wilson was 18 of 27 for 233 yards, with Lockett getting four catches for 120 yards. The Seahawks had 73 yards rushing after averaging 160 during the season. Dallas went into the game with the No. 5 rushing defense. Extra point Cowboys receiver Allen Hurns appeared to suffer a severe lower left leg injury in the first quarter. Hurns was being dragged down by Seahawks safety Bradley McDougald at the end of a 14-yard catch for a first down when his lower left leg appeared to buckle. The injury was announced as an ankle injury. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Cowboys Edge Seahawks As Elliott Leads Charge.

William Miller More On: new york mets Edwin Diaz's bone spur condition hasn't been a problem yet Mets' blockbuster Robinson Cano deal is done pending physicals Yasmani Grandal may be back in play to fill Mets' catching need Mets would land closer with 'big set of cojones' in Mariners deal It’s good to be back. That’s how Robinson Cano feels about the idea of returning to New York. “It feels good,” Cano told The Post when asked about having a chance to join the Mets. “It’s good to be back in New York.” Cano arrived at JFK Airport late Sunday night on a flight from the Dominican Republic with physicals for the deal bringing him from the Mariners to the Mets needing to be completed Monday. When asked if he thinks he’ll pass his physical, Cano said: “Yeah, it feels good right now.” The trade, which was agreed upon Saturday, sends the 36-year-old second baseman and closer Edwin Diaz to the Mets for Jay Bruce, Anthony Swarzak, prospects Jarred Kelenic and Justin Dunn and reliever Gerson Bautista. If all the medicals check out, the deal could be official as early as Monday. This will be Cano’s second stint in New York. The second baseman spent nine seasons with the Yankees before signing a 10-year, $240 million free-agent contract with the Mariners in 2013. At the airport, Cano was immediately recognized by a small group of fans as he entered the terminal and stopped to take photos. He is coming off a disappointing season that included an 80-game suspension for PEDs. Cano still slashed .303/.374/.471 with 10 homers and 50 RBIs and is expected to bolster a Mets lineup that will be without Yoenis Cespedes for a large portion of the season. He said he is looking forward to getting back on the field. “For me this season is motivating” Cano said. “It’s blessed always to wear a uniform, be able to play in the big leagues, to play sharp. Mets uniform, there is a lot of pride, a lot of good history and I’m ready to go.” Cano had to waive his no-trade clause to make the move happen. The eight-time All-Star, who spent five seasons in Seattle, said he spoke to Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen before deciding to OK the deal. “I know there is gonna be a lot of good things,” Cano said. The Mets will only have to pay a portion of the five-year, $120 million remaining on Cano’s contract. The Mariners will send $20 million to Flushing as part of the trade. While Cano is the recognizable name, Diaz is seen as the bigger get in the deal. The 24-year-old right-hander posted a 1.96 ERA and 57 saves for Seattle last season. Cano smiled when asked what Diaz can add to the Mets. “You guys see that last year,” he said. “He’s young, good arm, smart too.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Flipboard WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under exclusive ,  new york mets ,  robinson cano Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Flipboard WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Cashman fires back at 'completely false' Gary Sanchez rumo...

sport Matt Harvey Joins the Angels on a One-Year Deal - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Matt Harvey Joins the Angels on a One-Year Deal Supported by Matt Harvey Joins the Angels on a One-Year Deal Image Matt Harvey went 7-7 with a 4.50 E.R.A. in 24 starts with the Reds after being traded from the Mets last season.CreditCreditDylan Buell/Getty Images By Tyler Kepner Dec. 18, 2018 Years ago, when the baseball world looked ahead to this winter’s starry free-agent class, Matt Harvey stood out as an especially compelling name. He started the All-Star Game for the Mets in 2013 — his first full major league season — and two years later, after having Tommy John surgery, he started the first and last games of the World Series. But the years since then have been rough on Harvey, whose New York career burned out in a series of injuries and off-field distractions. After a calm and reasonably effective summer in Cincinnati following a trade from the Mets, Harvey found a new home on Tuesday night. Harvey agreed to a one-year, $11 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels, and can also earn a possible $3 million in incentives based on games started. The agreement, first reported by MLB.com, was confirmed by a person with direct knowledge of it who was not authorized to speak publicly because the deal was not yet official. Harvey, who will turn 30 in March, went 7-7 with a 4.50 E.R.A. in 24 starts with the Reds, who acquired him in a trade for catcher Devin Mesoraco after the Mets had designated him for assignment. Harvey had been demoted to the bullpen with the Mets after four starts in which he allowed 14 runs in 21 innings. The Mets had asked to send Harvey to the minors, but he exercised his right of refusal. It was a far cry from his heady early days with the Mets, when he posted a 2.53 E.R.A. across his first 65 starts, through 2015. That season ended with Harvey firing eight shutout innings while facing elimination in Game 5 of the World Series against Kansas City, only to falter in the ninth — after having lobbied Manager Terry Collins to stay in — as the Royals came back to win the title. Harvey was pitching under intense scrutiny at the time, having thrown more innings than the Mets and his agent, Scott Boras, had planned in his first full year after Tommy John surgery. He staggered through 17 uneven starts in 2016, when he developed thoracic outlet syndrome. The next season was even worse — his E.R.A. rose to 6.70 — as Harvey dealt with a stress fracture in his scapula. He did not help himself off their field, earning a three-game suspension from the Mets in May for failing to report to the ballpark on game day after a night of partying. After his trade to Cincinnati, Harvey seemed to restore his reputation as a solid major league starter, and averaged 94 miles per hour with his fastball. He could have commanded a lucrative, multiyear deal if he were still a star; even so, he scored an impressive payday given his medical history and his 5.39 E.R.A. over the last three seasons. The Angels finished 80-82 in 2018, another also-ran season during the prime of the game’s best player, center fielder Mike Trout. Harvey may not seem especially dependable, but his 155 innings last season would have ranked second, behind Andrew Heaney, on the Angels’ injury-ravaged pitching staff. Their most dynamic starter, the two-way sensation Shohei Ohtani, will not pitch this season after having Tommy John surgery. This is not the Angels’ first experience with Harvey. They chose him in the third round of the 2007 draft out of Fitch Senior High School in Groton, Conn., and offered a $1 million bonus. Harvey rejected it, enrolling at North Carolina and joining the Mets as a first-round pick three years later, beginning a bumpy baseball journey that now heads to the West Coast.

The Huskies (11-1) had not lost a regular-season game in regulation since a 76-70 home loss to Baylor in a Nos. 1 vs. 2 matchup on Feb. 18, 2013 — a span of 163 games. UConn’s only regular-season loss since then was a 88-86 overtime defeat at Stanford on Nov. 14, 2014. The Huskies had won 126 consecutive regular-season games, 58 of them nonconference matchups. UConn is the only No. 1 team Baylor has ever faced in Coach Kim Mulkey’s 19 seasons. Baylor had lost each of the previous three such meetings, including UConn’s last visit to Waco nearly five years ago.

sport LeBron James Is Expected to Miss at Least Another Week - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|LeBron James Is Expected to Miss at Least Another Week Supported by LeBron James Is Expected to Miss at Least Another Week Image LeBron James, recovering from a strained groin, sat on the Lakers’ bench with Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk during Sunday’s game against the Kings.CreditCreditAlex Gallardo/Associated Press By Scott Cacciola Jan. 4, 2019 LOS ANGELES — LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers has shown throughout his 16-year N.B.A. career that he is good at a lot of basketball-related activities, including scoring, passing, rebounding and winning. But perhaps one of his most remarkable assets — a feat, really — is his durability. He seldom misses games because of injury. But now, less than a week after turning 34, James is still on the mend from straining his left groin in a win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. The timetable for his return remains uncertain. The Lakers announced on Friday, before playing the visiting Knicks, that James would not make a coming trip with the team for back-to-back games against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday and the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. The Lakers’ next game after that is on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons at Staples Center. The team said in its statement that James was making “progress with his recovery” as he received daily treatment from the team’s medical staff and that he would be re-evaluated in one week. Entering Friday, the Lakers had lost three of the four games they had played without James, dropping them to eighth place in the Western Conference standings with a 21-17 record — a precarious position for a team with playoff hopes. The Sacramento Kings were two games back in ninth place. Image James injured his groin in a Lakers’ victory over the Golden State Warriors on Dec. 25.CreditKyle Terada/USA Today Sports, via Reuters James’s absence has been compounded by the loss of Rajon Rondo, a veteran point guard who injured a ligament in his right ring finger against the Warriors and could miss three to four more weeks after undergoing surgery. Rondo had already missed 17 games this season because of a fractured bone in the same hand. Their absences have meant an increased reliance on the team’s young core, which includes Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball. Those players have delivered at times, but not consistently enough to manufacture many wins. As for James, he had been playing some of the finest basketball of his career, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists while shooting 51.8 percent from the field and 35.6 percent from 3-point range. He appeared in each of the Lakers’ first 34 games and had not missed a game since April 12, 2017, back when he was employed by the Cleveland Cavaliers. That gave him a streak of 156 consecutive games played, including in the postseason. “I take a lot of pride in it,” James said of his sturdiness after injuring his groin. “That’s why it pissed me off not to be able to go back into the game. It’s more than anything being available to my teammates, being available to my coaching staff. That’s something I take more personal than anything. Hopefully it’s not a long thing.” The Lakers initially listed James as day-to-day after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam. But Coach Luke Walton has said that the team will be cautious with James, who signed a four-year, $154 million deal in July. For much of his career, James has been able to ward off the corrosive effects of his profession — the daily wear and tear, the punishment from defenders. If nothing else, the last couple of weeks have revealed him to be at least semi-mortal, after all — and the Lakers are taking no chances, hoping they can remain afloat until he returns.

sport Real Madrid, in a Tournament You Never Heard Of, Plays a Team You Never Heard Of - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Real Madrid, in a Tournament You Never Heard Of, Plays a Team You Never Heard Of Supported by Real Madrid, in a Tournament You Never Heard Of, Plays a Team You Never Heard Of Image Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale, right, celebrated with Marcelo after scoring a goal against Japan’s Kashima Antlers.CreditCreditGiuseppe Cacace/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Victor Mather Dec. 19, 2018 Real Madrid has won the Champions League three straight times. On Saturday, it will go for its third straight title in the Club World Cup, FIFA’s biggest club competition. And of all the clubs around the world, the one that will try to stop mighty Real in the final is … Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates? Though nominally a world championship event, the Club World Cup has struggled to be viewed as more than a glorified friendly, especially by the top European teams. Since the Cup started playing its current format, in 2005, the European entrant has made every final, and it has won 10 of the last 11 events. Few think that trend is going to change when Real faces Al Ain. The clubs almost play a different sport. Real has 13 Champions League titles. Al Ain has one Asian Champions League title, in 2003. Transfermarkt, which assesses player values, estimates that Marcus Berg, a 32-year-old Swedish striker for Al Ain, is worth 4.5 million euros, or about $5.1 million; and the team has three other million-euro players. Not too shabby? Well, Real Madrid has 21 players worth 10 million euros or more, including the 90-million-euro players Gareth Bale, Isco and Marco Asensio. What’s Al Ain even doing in this event in the first place? The Club World Cup’s main field features the champions of every continent: Africa, North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. But also thrown in each year is a team from the host nation, to keep things interesting for home fans. This year the U.A.E. is the host, giving Al Ain a spot that most thought would be essentially ceremonial. Image Al Ain celebrated a surprise victory over River Plate of Argentina in the Club World Cup semifinal.CreditAhmed Jadallah/Reuters It didn’t look too good for Al Ain in the preliminary round: The team fell behind by 3-0 to Wellington of New Zealand, the representative from the weak Oceania federation. (To qualify, Wellington had to beat teams from Papua New Guinea and Fiji.) But Al Ain fought back with three goals to tie the score, then won on penalties. Berg got the equalizer with five minutes to play, coming off the bench because of a virus. In the quarterfinal, Al Ain stomped the African champion, Espérance of Tunisia, 3-0. Then, in the semifinal against heavily favored River Plate of Argentina, Al Ain fought to a 2-2 draw and scored another penalty kick victory. Perhaps River was exhausted after surviving a South American championship, the Copa Libertadores, against its archrival Boca Juniors, that was delayed and then moved to Spain because of fan violence. In the other semifinal, Real Madrid imperiously swept away Kashima Antlers, the Asian champion from Japan, 3-1. Bale, the 90-million-euro superstar, had a hat trick. Next up for the Spanish steamroller: Al Ain. “We have reached the final, and so we will try our best,” Khalid Essa, the Al Ain goalkeeper, told The National of U.A.E. “It will be difficult, but if there is a chance, we have to aim high.” The Club World Cup is always likely to be an afterthought as long as the top European teams remain so much better than those in the rest of the world. FIFA is trying to address that with proposed changes, including shifting the event to every four years and adding many more teams, including several more from Europe. After these changes, the final is much more likely to be something like Barcelona-Manchester City or P.S.G.-Bayern. And few would argue with the notion that such matchups would be a fairer representation of the world’s best teams. But for now, fans have perhaps a last chance to enjoy a team from a city of 750,000 on the U.A.E.-Oman border competing for the championship of the world.

sport These College Basketball Players Will Be Fun to Watch (for One Year Only) - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|These College Basketball Players Will Be Fun to Watch (for One Year Only) Supported by These College Basketball Players Will Be Fun to Watch (for One Year Only) Image Duke forward Zion Williamson is among the country’s top freshmen.CreditCreditChuck Liddy/The News & Observer, via Associated Press By Victor Mather Nov. 6, 2018 The 2018-19 college basketball season begins tonight with a full slate of games filled with the top young players in the country. With changes to draft rules on the horizon, the era of one-and-done in college basketball may be drawing to a close. But for this season at least, the college game will again be dominated by freshmen making brief cameos in college towns across America. Here are the top 10 one-and-done players you’ll be watching in college basketball ... briefly. 1, 2, 3. R.J. Barrett F, Zion Williamson F, Cameron Reddish F, Duke ESPN rated them 1-2-3 in this season’s recruiting class. NBAdraft.net forecasts them to go 1-2-4 in next year’s draft (with Sekou Doumbouya of France at No. 3). And yeah, of course they’re all going to Duke. Barrett is 6 feet 6 inches tall but quick enough to play shooting guard. Williamson is one of the best jumpers the game has seen. Reddish can score and pass. The three begin their college careers on Tuesday against No. 2 Kentucky. Who’s the best of them? Pick any order. These freshman should give Duke an incredible season (it is ranked No. 4 in the preseason A.P. poll after a 29-8 season). Then they will all vanish to the N.B.A. 4. Bol Bol C, Oregon What’s not to like about Bol Bol? He’s the son of beloved ex-N.B.A. player Manute Bol, sharing his spindly frame but having even more skills. He’s also a sneakerhead, writing on The Player’s Tribune that a key to his choice of Oregon was the athletic gear available: “Shoes lined up on chairs. Custom Oregon colorway Jordans. Like 13 different jersey combinations. Nike stuff that hasn’t come out yet. Those Jordan 4 Oregon retros that LeBron was wearing recently — they had those in there.” ESPN rated Bol the No. 4 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go 14th in the N.B.A. draft. 5. Nassir Little F, North Carolina If North Carolina is going to match Duke and its freshman triumvirate in the A.C.C., it will need a great season from Little, a do-it-all kind of player. The Athletic compared him to Kawhi Leonard. ESPN rated Little the No. 6 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go fifth in the N.B.A. draft. 6. Romeo Langford G, Indiana It’s hard to believe that the storied Indiana program has not made the N.C.A.A. tournament in four seasons or the Final Four in 18. Langford probably won’t be able to turn things around by himself, but he could return the team (16-15 last season) to respectability. Scouts praise his ability to create his own shot. ESPN rated Langford the No. 5 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go seventh in the N.B.A. draft. 7. Charles Bassey C, Western Kentucky You read that right. It’s not Kentucky, but Western Kentucky that has the elite freshman this season. Western made the NIT Final Four last year and gets a huge upgrade with Bassey. A soccer player in his native Nigeria, Bassey has thrived in his new sport, and, if anything, is expected to be a better pro than a collegian. ESPN rated Bassey the No. 18 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go sixth in the N.B.A. draft. 8. Jalen Smith F, Maryland Maryland brought in a strong recruiting class, and Smith is at the top of it, a rare five-star player for the program. A skinny player who scores and plays defense, he joins a team that missed the tournament last season. ESPN rated Smith the No. 10 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go 16th in the N.B.A. draft. 9. Quentin Grimes G, Kansas What one-and-done list would be complete without a player from Kansas? A versatile guard, Grimes joins a strong returning squad that comes into the season ranked No. 1. As a Kansas one-and-done player with N.B.A. star potential, he joins Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid five years ago and Josh Jackson two years back. ESPN rated Grimes the No. 9 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go 18th in the N.B.A. draft. 10. Jaylen Hoard F, Wake Forest Wake Forest was 14th in the A.C.C. last season, and despite some good seasons here and there has never escaped the shadow of the conference’s superteams. Wake lost several key players in the off season leaving a tall order for Jaylen Hoard of France, an inside-outside player. Don’t expect Wake to compete with Duke and its three superfreshmen. ESPN rated Hoard the No. 22 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go ninth in the N.B.A. draft.

Jeff Zelevansky More from: Larry Brooks Vic Hadfield gives Mark Messier the ultimate compliment A night to remember: Rangers honoring legend Vic Hadfield Brady Skjei's frustration blunder helps cost Rangers in ugly loss Vinni Lettieri here to make most of his Rangers second chance Brendan Smith's switch to wing likely a one-time Rangers thing These nights are bittersweet and tinged with melancholy. Oh, there is romance in the air, all right, but whenever the Rangers celebrate their heritage, whenever they raise an other-than-1994 banner to the sky, the absence of the flags that count the most are visible the way amputated limbs can create pain. It was Vic Hadfield’s time on Sunday before the Rangers fell in a shootout loss to the Jets, time for one of only three captains in the past 68 years to lead the Blueshirts to the Cup final to have his No. 11 immortalized and raised to the pinwheel ceiling of the Garden to wave beside Jean Ratelle’s No. 19 and Rod Gilbert’s No. 7. The Three Amigos, together again, on the red carpet and in the rafters. GAG Line then, GAG Line now, GAG Line forever. The ceremony that preceded Sunday’s match against the Jets was poignant. There was the final and strongest incarnation of the Bulldog Line, with Steve Vickers, Walter Tkaczuk and Billy Fairbairn joining the festivities. There was the third line, Pete Stemkowski between Ted Irvine and Wee Bruce MacGregor. Jim Neilson was on hand; Bob Nevin, too. Of course, Eddie-Eddie-Eddie Giacomin, during his time, the most popular and beloved Blueshirt. And Brad Park, who, other than the man of the hour, probably received the loudest ovation of all from a crowd that is anticipating another No. 2 joining Brian Leetch at both the top of the building and the pinnacle of franchise recognition. That’s going to be a tough one, folks. There is no dispute of Park’s greatness as a Ranger, during which time he was a first-team NHL All-Star three times, a second-team All-Star twice, and runner-up four times (to Bobby Orr) for the Norris Trophy and a third-place finisher once. And that was accomplished within his seven full seasons in New York. see also Vic Hadfield gives Mark Messier the ultimate compliment MONTREAL — When Vic Hadfield is celebrated before Sunday’s match... Ah, but there’s the rub. Park played only 465 games as a Ranger — curious that when he appeared on the ice he was given his No. 2 with an “A” on it even though he followed Hadfield as captain — until he was sent to Boston on the Nov. 7, 1975, day of darkness. None of the 10 players immortalized by the organization played fewer than Giacomin’s 539. None of the eight skaters played fewer than Mark Messier’s 698. So there’s that. But retired numbers are not about digits and neither are the memories they evoke. Yes, Hadfield did score 50 goals, and so there is a magic number attached to his career, but he’d be the same man and have been the same cherished teammate and leader even if he’d finished 1971-72 with, say, the 43 goals scored that season by Gilbert. There is something to this franchise, something to this Original Six team that has a place in this city’s heritage that exceeds the day-to-day attention paid to New York City’s hockey team. There is something about Emile’s Era that has resonated for decades. Something about Emile Francis, The Cat himself, who was hailed when he stepped onto the ice and delivered a speech about Hadfield and the GAG Line. “I don’t think there’s any doubt Brad belongs there,” Hadfield had said Thursday about a Park number retirement. “But the other one is Emile. He orchestrated the whole thing. There has to be a way to honor him.” see also A night to remember: Rangers honoring legend Vic Hadfield The night belongs to Vic Hadfield, the guy who led... There has to be a way to honor Park — if you saw him you also have no doubt — and there has to be a way to honor Emile. There has to a way to honor Frank Boucher and Bill Cook, Original Rangers who were dominant forces and won Cups in 1928 and 1933, and there has to be a way to honor Ron Greschner, who wore his No. 4 as a participant in Sunday’s festivities. And if the Rangers are not going to double-retire No. 2, if they’re not going to retire No. 5 for Cook, and double-retire No. 7 for Boucher and not going to celebrate Greschner in that fashion — and hey, what about Lester Patrick, Bryan Hextall, Ching Johnson and Dean Prentice? — then it is time for the Garden to carve out a space for a Rangers Hall of Fame. Sunday, the organization honored one of its great ones. Typically, it was done in style. Vic Hadfield’s legacy will endure forever. But there are others deserving of recognition. It is time for Brad, it is time for Emile, it is time for a Rangers Hall of Fame. Because memories generated before 1994, and memories generated before 1972, they also last a lifetime.

Playoff Predictions: Our Picks for the Wild-Card Round Supported by N.F.L. Playoff Predictions: Our Picks for the Wild-Card Round The Texans, Cowboys, Ravens and Bears are all favorites at home, but there may be some upsets lurking. Look out for the Colts. Image The Ravens, led by Lamar Jackson’s unusual run-first approach, will host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday in an N.F.L. wild-card matchup.CreditCreditKelvin Kuo/Associated Press By Benjamin Hoffman Jan. 3, 2019 It was a race to the finish for teams like the Colts, the Ravens and the Eagles, but there is no time to celebrate as they all now have to back up their N.F.L. playoff positions by trying to beat fierce competition. The weekend’s wild-card matchups will be spread over two days, with a trip to the divisional round on the line. [Read: Tarik Cohen Makes Football Fun Again in Chicago] Here are our predictions for how the games will sort out, both in terms of who will win and who will win against the spread. Last week’s record against the spread: 11-5 Final regular-season record: 139-111-5 Image Darius Leonard, a rookie linebacker, was a one-man wrecking crew for Indianapolis this season.CreditMark Zaleski/Associated Press Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans 4:35 p.m. Saturday, ESPN and ABC From 1990 to 2017, only three teams started the season 0-3 and made the playoffs. This season’s Texans (11-5) not only accomplished that feat, but, entering Week 17, they were also in contention to have the best record in the A.F.C. The turnaround is nothing short of remarkable. It is a testament to the quality of the team’s defense and the star power of its quarterback, Deshaun Watson, and No. 1 wide receiver, DeAndre Hopkins. But to join the 1992 San Diego Chargers as the only teams since 1990 to win a playoff game after starting 0-3, the Texans will have to get through Indianapolis, which had a worse start to overcome: 1-5. The Colts (10-6) were 9-1 after their terrible start, joining the 2015 Kansas City Chiefs as the only teams since 1990 to make the playoffs after such a poor start. And they did it with quality play all over the field, finishing with the N.F.L.’s fifth-ranked scoring offense and its 10th-ranked scoring defense. Indianapolis won on the road in Houston in Week 14, ending the Texans’ nine-game winning streak, thanks to an outrageous effort from T.Y. Hilton, who had 199 receiving yards. After that game, Hilton was not shy about his ability to succeed at Houston’s NRG Stadium. “This is my second home, man,” Hilton said with a laugh. “This is my second home. I don’t know. Every time I come here, I just go off. I don’t know what it is.” Hilton wasn’t wrong. In his seven career trips to Houston, he has averaged 133 yards a game and scored seven touchdowns while the Colts have gone 5-2. Indianapolis also benefits from a fully operational Andrew Luck, who went from three years of battling shoulder woes to attempting a career-high 639 passes this season — 39 of which went for touchdowns. The team has an emerging star at running back in Marlon Mack, and a touchdown machine at tight end in Eric Ebron. And its defense got a breakout year from the rookie linebacker Darius Leonard, who was snubbed from the Pro Bowl but managed an N.F.L.-leading 163 tackles to go with seven sacks, two interceptions and two fumble recoveries. The Colts don’t typically travel well, but Houston seems to bring out the best in them. They should have the upper hand on Saturday. Pick to win: Colts Pick against the spread: Colts +1.5 Image The Dallas offense is led by Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott, but it seems to run best when Elliott does the bulk of the work.CreditMatthew Emmons/USA Today Sports, via Reuters Seattle Seahawks at Dallas Cowboys 8:15 p.m. Saturday, Fox Ezekiel Elliott won his second rushing title this season — in just his third year in the N.F.L. — despite sitting out Week 17. A dominant running back, he expects to shoulder the load for the Cowboys (10-6) in the playoffs, so the rest was welcome. “Just knowing that we’re going into these playoffs, I’m going to have the highest workload I probably had all season,” Elliott told reporters. Since Dallas was 6-1 in the seven games that Elliott carried the ball 20 or more times this season, and the Seahawks (10-6) allowed an ugly 4.9 yards a carry from opposing running backs, keeping the ball in Elliott’s hands is probably a good strategy. With Elliott, Dak Prescott and Amari Cooper all carrying the offense at different times this season, it’s easy to see why so many people focus on that side of the ball. But the Cowboys are in the playoffs largely because of a defense that has been retooled into something formidable. It allowed the sixth-fewest points in the N.F.L., was the No. 5 rushing defense, and while the secondary gave up more yards than it would have preferred, it became a far more formidable unit with the help of Kris Richard, a defensive backs coach who was one of the architects of Seattle’s Legion of Boom defense. Seattle probably deserved more attention for its play this season than it received. Largely written off in the preseason as a team that had reached the end of its contention window, the Seahawks easily qualified for the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons. Linebacker Bobby Wagner is still among the game’s best defensive players, and Russell Wilson managed to let the offense become more run-focused while still throwing 35 touchdown passes. And, as always, the Seahawks were a true force to be reckoned with at home. But this game is in Dallas, and expecting a team that was 4-4 on the road to win there seems unrealistic.

Mosley sealed Baltimore’s Week 17 win over Cleveland with an interception in the fourth quarter.CreditGail Burton/Associated Press Los Angeles Chargers at Baltimore Ravens 1:05 p.m. Sunday, CBS With Lamar Jackson at quarterback, the Ravens (10-6) were so dominant running the ball that the total of 159 yards they managed in a Week 16 win over the Chargers (12-4) was actually the team’s low point. It is a style of play that would be more typical of the 1940s than today’s N.F.L., but the Ravens’ run-first approach under Jackson led to a 6-1 finish to the regular season, with a series of opponents walking away wondering what just hit them — including the Chargers, who lost to Baltimore at home, 22-10. [Keeping Score: Philip Rivers Doesn’t Need a Ring to Be Great] “We couldn’t get them off the field on defense,” Chargers Coach Anthony Lynn said after the game. “And we couldn’t stay on the field on offense. We got outplayed. We got outcoached. It’s just that simple.” It is hard to figure out what was more dominant once Jackson took over: Baltimore’s running game, which generated 1,607 yards in seven games, or its run defense, which allowed 429. Image Philip Rivers and the Chargers’ offense generated just 10 points against Baltimore in Week 16.CreditKirby Lee/USA Today Sports, via Reuters Now the Chargers get a second crack against them, and while slowing Jackson and Gus Edwards is probably unlikely, Los Angeles can at least hope to generate more than the 10 points it managed at home in Week 16. There is some room to pass against the Ravens — Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield each threw for more than 300 yards against them in the season’s second half — but the Chargers should proceed with caution as Baltimore generated 10 turnovers in its final six games. The Chargers had a terrific season, which taken in totality was more impressive than Baltimore’s. But unless they figure something out based on the film of their fairly humiliating loss two weeks ago, quarterback Philip Rivers may have his season end early once again. Pick to win: Ravens Pick against the spread: Ravens -2.5 Image As he did last season, the backup quarterback Nick Foles led the Eagles’ offense to the playoffs.CreditMatt Rourke/Associated Press Eagles at Bears 4:40 p.m. Sunday, NBC The Eagles (9-7) weren’t even supposed to make the playoffs after they fell to 6-7 and lost quarterback Carson Wentz to a serious back injury. Now they enter wild-card weekend on a three-game winning streak, hoping they can recreate the success of last season, when they entered each playoff game as an underdog and still won the Super Bowl. It is a great story regardless of how it turns out, and the backup quarterback Nick Foles deserves a great deal of credit for revitalizing an offense that had often looked stagnant under Wentz. This time around, the Eagles appear to be underdogs not just in name, but also in terms of overall talent compared with the Bears (12-4). Chicago rode its suffocating defense and a good-enough offense to the third-best record in the N.F.C., and its formula of forcing turnovers and running the ball tends to play well once January rolls around. Image The Bears’ Khalil Mack has been a threat to opposing quarterbacks all season.CreditBrad Rempel/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Eagles might not have to contend with Chicago’s best defensive back, Eddie Jackson, who is questionable with an ankle injury, but the Bears still have plenty of defenders who should give Foles nightmares, including Khalil Mack, Akiem Hicks and Kyle Fuller. Chicago’s offense is not nearly as advanced as its defense. Mitchell Trubisky is a tentative passer, but Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen have the ability to grind games out on the ground. Because the defense scores so much on its own, the Bears finished with the ninth-most points in the N.F.L. despite being ranked 21st in total yards. By no means should Philadelphia be written off in this game, as the Eagles have a championship-winning defense in place and an offense that is on a hot streak. But beating one of the top teams in the N.F.L., on the road, is likely out of the Eagles’ reach.

sport St. John’s Rides Transfers to Renewed Relevance - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|St. John’s Rides Transfers to Renewed Relevance Supported by St. John’s Rides Transfers to Renewed Relevance Image Forward Marvin Clark II is a part of a group of transfers that has helped make St. John’s a solid team again.CreditCreditKevin Hagen/Associated Press By Adam Zagoria Jan. 3, 2019 After Shamorie Ponds of the St. John’s Red Storm fed Mustapha Heron for a rim-rattling dunk before a capacity crowd at Carnesecca Arena in Queens on Tuesday night, Marvin Clark II walked to the center of the court and stood in the middle of the team’s red logo. He faced a crowd of more than 5,000 people, including the tennis legend John McEnroe, and waved his arms to stoke the cheers. Like many of the St. John’s men’s basketball players this season, the 6-foot-7 Clark had seen this sort of thing done before — in other places. He played in a Final Four for Michigan State and Coach Tom Izzo in 2015, notching 10 minutes as a freshman when the Spartans lost to Duke. After his sophomore year, he transferred to St. John’s, where he believed he could play a larger role. Mission accomplished. On Tuesday night, Clark scored 22 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in an 89-69 win over No. 16 Marquette, the most impressive victory this season for Coach Chris Mullin’s resurgent team, which is 13-1 over all entering an early Big East matchup with Georgetown (11-3) on Saturday in Washington. “Coming here, leaving a storied program like Michigan State University, a Hall of Fame coach like Coach Izzo, that’s a big risk, a big gamble,” Clark said of his transfer. “I felt like I could do what I’m doing now. I felt like I had the ability to do it, I just needed a coaching staff to believe in me.” Relying on transfers is not unique in today’s college basketball world. Kansas and Nevada, who are ranked in the top 10, rely on transfers for key roles. But St. John’s has taken the transfer trend to an extreme. Eight of the 13 players on scholarship this season, including Clark, are transfers from other Division I universities or from a junior college. Four of them are starters: Clark and L.J. Figueroa at forward and Heron and Justin Simon at guard. Against Marquette, the four combined for 61 points. Image Coach Chris Mullin is happy to embrace a homegrown talent like Shamorie Ponds, but has also welcomed transfers from other programs.CreditFrank Franklin Ii/Associated Press Ponds, a former New York City prep star who scored 26 points against Marquette, is the lone homegrown starter. The Red Storm even added another transfer last week and subtracted one this week. The former North Carolina State big man Ian Steere joined the program at the semester break, and Mikey Dixon, who transferred in from Quinnipiac after the 2016-17 season, said on Thursday that he would be transferring out. St. John’s is also expecting two junior college transfers, point guard Cameron Mack and forward Valdir Manuel, for the 2019-20 season. “We’ve brought in players who were at great programs playing for some great coaches, so I believe that’s an advantage,” Mullin said. “Our transfers are a little more locked in, open-minded and accountable.” Transfers from other Division I institutions must sit out a year, unless they receive a waiver, like the one Heron, a former Auburn shooting guard, received. Heron, whose hometown is Waterbury, Conn., was granted a relief waiver to play immediately this season after arguing that he was transferring closer to home to be near his ailing mother. Junior college transfers are eligible immediately. Transfers bring maturity and experience, and can quickly turn a bad program into a good one. At St. John’s, the recent emphasis represents a cultural shift from when Mullin starred at St. John’s in the 1980s. The 1984-85 team he led to the Final Four consisted almost entirely of players from New York and New Jersey who began as freshmen. The N.C.A.A. reported last month that about 40 percent of men’s basketball players who enter Division I directly out of high school depart their initial school by the end of their sophomore year. At St. John’s, the assistant coach Matt Abdelmassih receives credit for building much of the current roster through transfers. Abdelmassih was an assistant at Iowa State under its onetime coach Fred Hoiberg. That team reached the round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. tournament in 2015 with a roster that included half a dozen transfers. Several went on to play professionally. Abdelmassih uses that as a recruiting tool. He tried recruiting Clark to Iowa State, and had Hoiberg not left for the Chicago Bulls, Clark might have landed there. When Clark opted to leave Michigan State, Abdelmassih targeted him for St. John’s. Image Mustapha Heron began his college basketball career at Auburn. CreditNicole Sweet/USA Today Sports, via Reuters “I wouldn’t say we were the first team to take transfers because that’s been going on forever,” Abdelmassih said. “But I think we were definitely one of the first at building almost an entire roster with the makeup of taking transfers. And it put us on a national stage.” Abdelmassih, who landed at St. John’s in 2015, said he likes the attitude that transfers bring, and it also helps him avoid some of the drama that can sometimes surround high-level high school prospects. He said the transfers often come in with a chip on their shoulder and more humility than freshmen. Entering this season, Mullin was 40-60 at his alma mater through three years, and his teams had never finished better than eighth in the Big East. This year, the Red Storm were picked fourth, and many expect them to be an N.C.A.A. tournament team. “The fact that Marvin Clark and Justin Simon are guys who played at really good programs before and now have gone to play for another good program, I think it’s the reason they’re 13-1 and their shooting percentages are off the charts and they’re as good as they are,” Seton Hall Coach Kevin Willard said. Villanova Coach Jay Wright noted that Mullin was showing he could bring in older players from elsewhere and meld them into a cohesive unit heading into the most important months of the season. “You’ve got veteran college basketball players who have had success together starting conference play,” Wright said. “It’s a really well done job on Chris’s part of being patient and getting these guys ready for the season.” Now Clark is dreaming of a return to the Final Four. “It would immortalize this team forever in New York folklore and it would definitely get this program back to where it needs to be,” he said.

sport Tom Thibodeau Is Fired by Timberwolves, After a 22-Point Win - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Tom Thibodeau Is Fired by Timberwolves, After a 22-Point Win Supported by Tom Thibodeau Is Fired by Timberwolves, After a 22-Point Win Image Tom Thibodeau was 97-107 in his two-plus years in Minnesota. He took the team to the playoffs once.CreditCreditMatt Marton/Associated Press By Marc Stein Jan. 6, 2019 Tom Thibodeau, the Minnesota Timberwolves’ coach and president, was abruptly fired on Sunday night — after a 22-point victory. Following a 108-86 rout at home against the LeBron James-less Los Angeles Lakers, Minnesota announced that it had ousted Thibodeau with two and a half seasons left on his five-year contract, and less than two months removed from the trade of the longtime Thibodeau favorite Jimmy Butler to the Philadelphia 76ers. Ryan Saunders, son of the former Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders, was elevated to interim coach with the Wolves at 19-21 — two games behind the eighth-seeded Lakers in the Western Conference. Saunders, 32, will be the N.B.A.’s youngest coach. Thibodeau is the third N.B.A. coach to be fired this season, joining Fred Hoiberg of the Chicago Bulls and Tyronn Lue of the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was widely presumed that Thibodeau would be in trouble at season’s end if he failed to secure a playoff berth after the headline-making deterioration of Minnesota’s relationship with Butler since the end of last season. The timing of this change, though, suggests that the Timberwolves felt a need to create two prime vacancies before Hoiberg finds a new job. The New York Times reported in December that the Wolves would probably be the only N.B.A. team to consider hiring Hoiberg to coach after his unsuccessful stint in Chicago, because of Hoiberg’s close relationship with the Timberwolves’ owner, Glen Taylor. Image Thibodeau’s relationship with Jimmy Butler led to the coach initially resisting trading the star before ultimately sending him to Philadelphia.CreditHarrison Barden/USA Today Sports, via Reuters With Hoiberg also expected to be a serious candidate for U.C.L.A.’s coaching vacancy, Minnesota can now contend for his services. ESPN reported Sunday night that the Wolves, though, are determined to keep the coaching and personnel roles separate in the future, meaning Hoiberg — or anyone else they hire — would have to choose one or the other. Thibodeau’s dismissal leaves San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich as the only coach in the 30-team N.B.A. who also holds personnel power as team president. But even Popovich does not operate in that manner, delegating virtually all of his personnel power to the team president, R. C. Buford. The Timberwolves ended a 13-year playoff drought last season by posting a 47-35 record, with Butler and the young center Karl-Anthony Towns emerging as All-Stars. Butler, however, rebuffed Minnesota’s offer of a contract extension in July in the first hint of his discontent. He ultimately asked for a trade days before the start of training camp in September — despite a long association with Thibodeau dating to their days in Chicago. Butler maintained that he had made his desire to leave Minnesota in free agency clear to the Wolves for months. But Thibodeau and his general manager, Scott Layden, did not begin to seek trades for Butler until training camp was underway and ultimately dealt him to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 for a package headlined by Dario Saric and Robert Covington. The team was 4-9 at the time. “I said let’s let it go and see how things worked and I think now, we’ve gone up through halfway through the season and I don’t think we’re where we thought we would be or where we think we should be,” Taylor told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune. “I’m just looking at the results. The results are that I don’t think we should’ve lost against Phoenix or Detroit or New Orleans or Atlanta. Maybe one of those games. We just lost against a bunch of teams that we’re a better team.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Timberwolves Win by 22 And Then Fire Their Coach.

sport 2019 Women’s World Cup Draw: a Primer - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|2019 Women’s World Cup Draw: a Primer Supported by 2019 Women’s World Cup Draw: a Primer Image Ettie, the Women’s World Cup mascot, with the tournament’s big prize.CreditCreditFranck Fife/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Victor Mather Dec. 7, 2018 The Women’s World Cup draw is Saturday in France, only a week after New Zealand thumped Fiji to claim the final place in the tournament. That means the United States, one of the tournament favorites; the host, France; and the rest of the 24-team field will find out their opponents for the group stage and the cities where those games will take place. Here’s a primer before the balls are pulled out of the pots. When and Where Is the Draw? The draw is Saturday at the Seine Musicale in Paris (6 p.m. local time, noon Eastern). It will be broadcast live in the United States on Fox Sports 2 and Telemundo. How Does the Draw Work? The procedure for the Women’s World Cup mirrors the one for FIFA’s men’s quadrennial championship. In the women’s draw, the 24 teams that have qualified have been grouped into four pots determined by their world rankings. Each group at the World Cup will consist of four teams, one from each pot. The United States is in Pot 1 with the other top teams. With the exception of Europe, which has the most teams in the field, countries from the same confederation cannot be placed in the same first-round group. Who Could the United States Play? At this point, it’s easier to determine the teams they cannot face in the group stage. For example, they can’t face any of the other top teams — France, Germany, England, Australia and Canada — who have joined them in Pot 1, and they can’t face the other team from their region, Jamaica. That still leaves a wide range of possible opponents, from second-tier contenders like the Netherlands and Brazil to newcomers like Chile and South Africa. When Is the Tournament? France will host the opening match on June 7 in Paris. The final is July 7 in Lyon. Who Are the Top Contenders? Host France and the Olympic champion, Germany, are the main threats to the United States, but elite women’s soccer gets more democratized every year. England, the third-place finisher in 2015, is back, but it’s the Netherlands that arrives as the reigning European champion. Japan, the last World Cup runner-up, has — in Australia — a serious challenger to its supremacy in Asia. Who Could Surprise? Look out for Spain, 8-0 in its qualification group, and Australia, which — led by the frequently underappreciated scorer Sam Kerr — finished ahead of Brazil and Japan and nearly topped the United States last summer in U.S. Soccer’s invitation-only Tournament of Nations. Image Jamaica is one of four teams making their first appearance in the tournament.CreditRichard W. Rodriguez/Associated Press Are There New Teams This Year? Yes, four of them. Chile finished second behind Brazil in South American qualifying, claiming its first World Cup bid, and Jamaica grabbed a Concacaf spot that many thought would go to Mexico. Scotland beat out Switzerland in its European qualifying group. And South Africa took second to Nigeria in the African championship. Who’s Missing? North Korea, ranked 14th in the world, will miss out after being eliminated by South Korea on a tiebreaker. But that is a rare exception. Every Women’s World Cup and Olympic women’s soccer medalist in history is in the event. Image Megan Rapinoe, left, and Alex Morgan are two of the top American threats.CreditTannen Maury/EPA, via Shutterstock Who Are the Players to Watch? Most of the world’s top players are expected to be on hand, including American stalwarts like Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Lindsey Horan. But dominant players like midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsán of Germany; the ageless Marta of Brazil; Kerr, Australia’s goal machine; defender Lucy Bronze of England; and the UEFA Women’s Champions League winner Eugénie Le Sommer of France also will play. But the top two finishers in the balloting for the first women’s Ballon d’Or will not be there. Ada Hegerberg, the winner for her exploits with her club, Olympique Lyon, has chosen not to play for Norway. And Pernille Harder’s Denmark did not make the cut.

sport U.S. Soccer Hires Gregg Berhalter as Coach of National Team - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|U.S. Soccer Hires Gregg Berhalter as Coach of National Team Supported by U.S. Soccer Hires Gregg Berhalter as Coach of National Team Image Gregg Berhalter will be introduced as the United States’ national team coach on Tuesday.CreditCreditBrandon Wade/Associated Press By Andrew Das Dec. 1, 2018 The worst-kept secret in American soccer is now official: Gregg Berhalter will be the next coach of the United States men’s national team. Berhalter, who will leave the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer after five seasons, was the handpicked choice of the national team’s new general manager, Earnie Stewart. But his hiring did not become a done deal until U.S. Soccer’s board of directors approved his contract in a conference call. That call took place Saturday, according to a person familiar with the decision. The 45-year-old Berhalter, a former defender who represented the United States on two World Cup teams, is expected to be introduced as the national team coach on Tuesday in New York. Image Earnie Stewart, center, with Berhalter after a win over Mexico at the 2002 World Cup. Stewart, now the United States national team’s general manager, made the call to hire his former teammate.CreditAndrew Winning/Reuters His hiring, rumored for months and reported as agreed upon as early as Nov. 23, ends a remarkably slow-moving search that began with the team’s World Cup qualifying humiliation in Couva, Trinidad, nearly 14 months ago. In the interregnum, U.S. Soccer endured a bitter campaign to elect a new president, won the rights to co-host the 2026 World Cup and watched the 2018 tournament in Russia from afar. It has also seen the men’s team drift through a dozen games under a caretaker coach, Dave Sarachan, while Stewart — hired as general manager in June and on the job only since Aug. 1 — began the long-delayed search for Bruce Arena’s permanent replacement. Stewart made few comments on the coaches he was speaking with — his initial working list included almost three dozen names, including some who were suggested to him and others who sought him out to offer their services — and in his rare comments to reporters set a curiously high bar for what he considered a formal interview for the position. But after narrowing the official list twice, Stewart cast his lot with Berhalter, a former teammate. Image Berhalter, 45, has coached Major League Soccer’s Columbus Crew since November 2013.CreditNick Wass/Associated Press Berhalter’s contract is expected to carry him through a four-year World Cup cycle that he, his new players and — most important — the federation hope will end in a redemptive appearance by the United States at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. While the end of the team’s leadership vacuum will come as a relief for U.S. Soccer, the plodding pace of the search — a persistent frustration for fans over the past year — was not its finest hour. In recent weeks, the frustration about the team even began to bubble up from inside the locker room. Christian Pulisic, the team’s brightest star, strongly hinted after a game in London last month that the team needed some direction after more than a year under Sarachan, a longtime Arena assistant but never a serious candidate for the permanent post. “We definitely want a permanent head coach,” Pulisic said, “someone who has a plan and someone who has a great idea of how we want to play moving forward.” Image Berhalter battling Mexico’s Jared Borgetti in 2005. A sturdy defender, Berhalter made more than 40 appearances for the United States.CreditJuan Barreto/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Berhalter, whose Columbus team was eliminated from the M.L.S. playoffs weeks ago, should hit the ground running. He has kept journals about tactics, but also his personal successes and failures, since his playing days in the Dutch league, and his Columbus teams — short on star power but long on preparation and organization — earned a reputation for punching above their weight in M.L.S. The decision to give him the national team job will do little to appease critics of U.S. Soccer’s insider culture (Berhalter’s older brother Jay is U.S. Soccer’s chief commercial officer) or its outreach efforts to the country’s large Hispanic soccer community, which has often felt its contributions — and its players — have been marginalized by the federation. But Berhalter’s credentials appealed to the one person who mattered most: Stewart. Berhalter represented clubs in the Netherlands, England and Germany during a long playing career, and made more than 40 appearances for the United States senior team — including two starts in the knockout stage of the 2002 World Cup. He earned his coaching licenses while playing in Europe and cut his teeth in an 18-month stint leading Hammarby in Sweden. Fired for fielding teams that were deemed “too defensive,” he returned to M.L.S. — where he had won a league title as a player, under Arena in Los Angeles — to lead Columbus to the playoffs in four of his five seasons in charge. Berhalter’s first look at the United States team will come in its annual January training camp, which most likely will take place without most of the squad’s European pros. (The January dates are not on the official FIFA calendar, meaning clubs are not required to release their players for them.) That camp will be more than 16 months after the team’s stunning loss to Trinidad and Tobago in World Cup qualifying shook U.S. Soccer to its core. The 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle is expected to begin next fall.

Kawhi Leonard was back in San Antonio on Thursday to play his former team. The Spurs beat the Raptors, 125-107.CreditCreditRonald Cortes/Getty Images Supported by By Marc Stein Jan. 4, 2019 SAN ANTONIO — High above the floor at the AT&T Center hang the retired numbers of eight former San Antonio Spurs. Kawhi Leonard seemingly has a very strong case to see his old No. 2 hoisted among them someday. “I would think so,” Danny Green said Thursday night, when he and Leonard made their shared return to San Antonio as members of the Toronto Raptors. “He’s a finals MVP, led this team to a championship, won a couple defensive player of the years,” Green added. “Not everybody who’s come through here has done that.” Yet it’s likewise true that no Spur over these past two decades of rampant San Antonio success left town the way Leonard did. No prominent Spur before Leonard, in the Gregg Popovich era, ever forced his way out in such contentious circumstances. So you have to believe that it’s going to be a long time around here before the Spurs, and especially their jilted fans, will be able to look back with fondness on the undeniable highs of Leonard’s time in the Alamo City. That was the clear conclusion after the Spurs inflicted a 125-107 rout upon the Raptors in the teams’ first meeting since the blockbuster trade in July that sent Leonard to Toronto — thanks to the copious amounts of vitriol heaped in his direction for nearly three hours. Once dubbed the “future face of the franchise” by Popovich himself, Leonard was booed relentlessly in his first game as a visitor to the building that served as home for his first seven N.B.A. seasons. He was lustily booed on all 10 shots he took during pregame layup lines, heard the home crowd’s displeasure even louder when he was introduced right after the beloved Green and was booed every time he took possession of the ball for four full quarters. During a pregame tribute video titled “Thank You Danny & Kawhi,” Leonard and Green were alternately jeered and cheered depending on whose face showed up on the video board overhead. And on a trip to the free-throw line late in the first half, Leonard was serenaded with an unmistakable chant of “traitor, traitor, traitor.” The Spurs capitalized on the energy in the building, as well as the injury absence of the Toronto All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry (back), and romped to a 34-11 lead. Leonard finished with a muted 21 points and found little comfort beyond a postgame hug with Popovich — just two nights removed from a career-best 45 points in a victory over Utah. “I embraced it, enjoyed the moment and it’s only going to make me better,” Leonard insisted afterward. Local satisfaction was only amplified by the performance from the All-Star — DeMar DeRozan — that San Antonio acquired from Toronto in exchange for Leonard. To underline the marked improvement in his playmaking since becoming a Spur, as well as surely to spite the Toronto General Manager Masai Ujiri for giving up on him, DeRozan totaled 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his first career triple-double. Image Leonard and Gregg Popovich, the Spurs coach, chatted before the game.CreditRonald Cortes/Getty Images “I told him it was about time,” joked Popovich, who added that DeRozan is “playing downhill” and “attracting a crowd” to subsequently find open teammates better than he ever envisioned when the trade was made. “I didn’t know about the passing,” Popovich said. Cathartic as the whole evening seemed, though, it will take much more than one beatdown for the Spurs to say they have healed from the events of last season. The team’s relationship with Leonard steadily deteriorated to the point that the Most Valuable Player of the 2014 N.B.A. finals, rather than sign a $219 million contract extension, stunningly asked out. The presumed cause of that breakdown is disagreements over the treatment of a mysterious leg injury that limited Leonard to nine games last season. We have to presume, because Leonard has yet to explain the roots of his discontent, saying again at Thursday morning’s shootaround when asked to share his motivations for seeking a trade, “I’m not going to discuss that here today.” What’s undeniable is that the Spurs were rocked by (and are still recovering from) Leonard’s determination to play elsewhere this season and then proceed to free agency in July, when the Los Angeles Clippers are widely expected to emerge as a serious threat to sign Leonard away from the Raptors. Throughout the Popovich era, which began in earnest when he took over as coach 18 games into the 1996-97 season, San Antonio has emphasized and taken great pride in its player relations as much as any team on the N.B.A. map. It’s a big reason the Leonard saga stung the organization so deeply. “It was rough on everybody,” said San Antonio guard Bryn Forbes. Perhaps that’s why Popovich, when speaking to reporters before the game, struggled to play down the occasion. He initially dismissed the hoopla surrounding Leonard’s return as a focus for “mostly you guys” in the news media, before ultimately admitting, “But I get it.” Popovich understands as well as anyone that these wounds won’t heal quickly for anyone in South Texas. The Spurs, mind you, are trying. They’re up to a surprising seventh in the Western Conference at 22-17, despite a shortage of 3-point specialists, at a time they have never been more valued in the game, as well as concerns coming into the season about their collective ability defensively. After a 1-4 skid in early December in which it suffered defeats by 39, 31 and 34 points, San Antonio has won 11 of 14. The Spurs also rank No. 1 in the league in offensive efficiency and No. 4 in defensive efficiency over the past month since allowing 120 points in a Dec. 7 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. It won’t be long, though, before the Spurs are reunited with Leonard again. The backdrop will be completely different, with Toronto playing host to San Antonio on Feb. 22 in front of what will surely be an adoring audience at Scotiabank Arena. But many of the same emotions are bound to be dredged up. “They love him,” Raptors Coach Nick Nurse said of Leonard. “They love their players in Toronto, as you know, and he gives them a little bit more every game.” As for where he stands with the San Antonians who once regarded him as an heir to those immortalized in the rafters — most notably Tim Duncan and David Robinson — Leonard was forced to acknowledge that it’s way too soon to even imagine repairing the damage his departure caused. “I really don’t reflect on what happened probably until I retire,” Leonard said.

Allen finished with 19 points and 6 rebounds.CreditCreditNuccio Dinuzzo/Associated Press By The Associated Press Jan. 6, 2019 CHICAGO — D’Angelo Russell scored 28 points, DeMarre Carroll had 20 points off the bench, and the Nets beat the Chicago Bulls, 117-100, on Sunday for their third straight victory. Jarrett Allen added 19 and 6 rebounds as the Nets improved to 12-3 in their last 15 games, matching their best 15-game stretch since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. Russell topped 20 points for the fourth straight game and is averaging 26.5 points in the stretch. “D’Angelo is just taking it to a whole other level,” Carroll said. “He’s getting everybody involved, he’s scoring the ball when he needs to. He’s got a complete game right now, and I think that’s what we need from him in order to go far and go deep.” The Nets (20-21) did not win their 20th game last season until Feb. 26, also against Chicago. The victory was their 10th on the road; it took them until March 28 to reach that level last season. The Bulls (10-30) lost their fourth straight over all and fifth in a row to the Nets. The Nets, who finished 12th in the Eastern Conference with a 28-54 record last season, are in the running for their first playoff berth since 2014-15. “We’ve been playing at a good level,” Russell said. “Just taking care of what we’re supposed to take care of. Giving ourselves a chance when the numbers aren’t in our favor. Our confidence is high.” The Nets made 16 3-pointers. Russell was 6 for 14 from beyond the arc. “They made shots,” Bulls Coach Jim Boylen said. “They got to where they wanted to get to. And they made shots. We can’t give up 117 at home.” Zach LaVine had 27 points for Chicago and Bobby Portis scored 17 in 20 minutes off the bench after missing seven games with a sprained right ankle. Kris Dunn added 16 points, but the Nets pulled away in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Bulls by 29-18. Both teams started slowly, with the Bulls hitting just one of their first eight shots and the Nets connecting on just three of 10. But with Carroll kicking in 9 points, the Nets moved ahead by 28-21 after the first quarter. The Nets opened a 12-point lead when Russell hit a 3-pointer 58 seconds into the second quarter. Led by energized play from LaVine and Porter, the Bulls came back to briefly take a 1-point lead before the half, and then settle for a 55-55 tie at halftime. LaVine had 16 points and Portis had 9 in the second quarter. LaVine made five straight baskets — four on driving layups, and a 3-pointer — in a three-and-a-half-minute stretch to put the Bulls back in the game. Russell had 10 points and Allen had 9 at the half. Both kicked into a higher offensive gear to start the third as the Nets pulled out to another 12-point lead midway through the quarter. Russell hit three straight 3-pointers in 2 minutes 31 seconds. The Nets had an 88-82 lead entering the fourth quarter, then used a 16-5 run to seal the victory as Russell kept rolling. “They hit a lot of 3s, but we played good and we battled them,” LaVine said. “But over all as a team, we’ve just got to be tougher.” JORDAN, JAMES, AND NOW WADE Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat joined Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only players in N.B.A. history with at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocked shots and 500 3-pointers. Wade joined the elite club by hitting a 3 in the third quarter of a 106-82 loss at Atlanta. Before that, the Heat had missed 20 of their first 22 shots from beyond the arc; they finished 5 for 34.

sport Will the Rose Bowl Stand in the Way of a Bigger College Football Playoff? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Will the Rose Bowl Stand in the Way of a Bigger College Football Playoff? Supported by On College Football Will the Rose Bowl Stand in the Way of a Bigger College Football Playoff? Image The iconic status of the Rose Bowl is one of the biggest obstacles to expanding the College Football Playoff.CreditCreditHarry How/Getty Images By Marc Tracy Jan. 4, 2019 PASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract. Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif. “It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic. Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal. “What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?” Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse. On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given. “With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.” It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question. The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season. “In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee. Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California. Image Jim Delany of the Big Ten is willing to talk about expansion.CreditNam Y. Huh/Associated Press During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.” “Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.” Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again. Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.” Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.” He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN. Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other. The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare. To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games. That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December. But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution. Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued. For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans. “I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Prickly Issue In Pasadena: Expanding The Playoff.

sport Criticism of Ravens QB Lamar Jackson hits absurd levels Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Benching Lamar Jackson for Joe Flacco wasn't going to save Ravens, so stop crushing the rookie QB Kimberley A. Martin Senior NFL writerYahoo SportsJanuary 7, 2019, 2:03 AM GMT With Lamar Jackson, there’s always a chance. A chance to pull off the improbable. A chance to defy expectations. And a chance, most importantly, to win. Scroll to continue with content Ad It’s why the stage still belonged to the Ravens rookie quarterback late in the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers. And it’s why Joe Flacco, a former Super Bowl champion MVP, was left sitting on the bench. The moment — and the future — belongs to Jackson. For better or worse. And on Sunday, it was worse for Baltimore before it got better, and suddenly it all ended in crushing fashion. Jackson can be his own worst enemy — evidenced by his three fumbles that bookended an erratic and electrifying effort in Baltimore’s 23-17 loss to the higher-seeded Chargers. With 1:51 left on the clock, Jackson had rebounded from a double-digit deficit and thrown more passing yards than Chargers veteran quarterback Philip Rivers. With 45 seconds to go, the Ravens were back on the field with a chance to complete a storybook comeback. Lamar Jackson’s comeback efforts fell short on Sunday as the Ravens lost to the Chargers, 23-17 on Sunday in the wild-card round of the AFC playoffs. (Getty Images) But Jackson’s final fumble of the game sealed a victory for the Chargers, who now will face the perennial power New England Patriots in an AFC divisional-round game next week. But what’s more maddening than Jackson’s carelessness with the football are the constants criticisms of the former Heisman trophy winner. Let me guess: You still think Joe Flacco could have saved the day? Is that right? Flacco, the 33-year-old quarterback, who hasn’t played in two months because of an ailing hip, was somehow going to have better luck evading the Chargers’ relentless pressure? Flacco, who lost his job because of injury and never reclaimed it, was somehow going to thrive behind a Ravens offensive line that was playing so poorly its starting left guard had to be benched? Is that what you think? Story continues Whether he agreed or not, Flacco said he understood the decision to keep Jackson in the game and offered support for the rookie. “No, no, you can’t even go there, man,” the once elite quarterback told reporters, when asked if he thought he could have made a difference in the final score. “I thought Lamar did a great job of just hanging in there. You know, he gave us a chance at the end.” It’s why Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith was so irritated by fans booing and clamoring for Flacco behind their bench that he felt compelled to remind them of one simple truth: “I love Flacc, but No. 8 got us here.” There was only one rookie quarterback in this playoff field — and it wasn’t Baker Mayfield or Sam Darnold or Josh Allen or Josh Rosen. It was Jackson, a soon-to-be 22-year-old dual-threat quarterback who didn’t get his first start until Week 11. With Jackson as their new leader, the Ravens finished 6-1 and won the AFC North title. But Baltimore’s playoff magic didn’t last long. Thanks to woeful offensive line play, the Ravens struggled to get its run game going, and without the threat of a rushing attack to set up play-action, the Ravens’ offense stalled for three quarters. Behind Jackson’s escapability and arm strength, more aggressive play-calling, key defensive stops and momentum-shifting special-teams plays, Baltimore rebounded from a double-digit deficit and had a chance to pull off the improbable comeback late. In the end, though, Jackson’s fourth-quarter stats (169 yards on 11-for-20 passing, 14 rushing yards, two touchdowns) weren’t enough to overshadow his first three quarters of work (25 yards on 3-for-9 passing, 40 rushing yards, zero touchdowns and an interception). But it’s naive to think Flacco — a veteran on the downside of his career who went 4-5 with 12 touchdowns and six interceptions this season — would provide the second-half spark Baltimore needed. In the locker room Smith explained his rational on talking back to those select fair-weather fans, saying: “When things got rough, you turned your back on him. That just got under my skin a little bit. I went to them and told them, ‘Yo, you either ride or die or you get the hell out of here.” Those doubters have always been there. They existed long before former team executive and ESPN analyst Bill Polian inexplicably touted the notion that Jackson was better suited to be a wide receiver in the NFL. And those same detractors will use Jackson’s performance as more proof of his inability to be a pocket-passer in this league. Why are people so determined to squeeze Jackson into the mold of what they perceive a quarterback should be, rather than marvel at Jackson’s God-given ability to beat a defense any number of ways? He is only eight starts into his NFL career, yet so many seem to judge Jackson more harshly than other rookie quarterbacks. Why are some people so quick to forget that he’s not a finished product? Why is it so difficult to give him time, to wait and see how he develops as a passer, to expand one’s view of how a quarterback should look on the field? The Ravens have moved past the Joe Flacco era. (AP) Jackson may not be your prototypical stand-in-the-pocket quarterback, but he already has shown an ability to beat teams with his arm and his legs. No, he didn’t win Sunday. And no, the Ravens’ playoff run won’t continue. But Baltimore has reason to be excited about this offseason and what lies ahead with Jackson at the helm. “Lamar is our quarterback going forward – no question about that,” said Ravens coach John Harbaugh, who added that his call to stick with Jackson late in the game was “the right decision. … Joe can still play, and I think we saw that first half of the season. Joe is going to have a market. A lot of teams are going to want Joe.” But not the Ravens. The “big picture” is far bigger than what the aging Flacco might possibly have produced coming off the bench. Jackson got the Ravens to the postseason, and he deserved to see this game through to the end. Because that’s what you give your quarterback: A chance. A chance to try to pull off the improbable. A chance to defy expectations. And a chance to win.

sport Yankees and Zach Britton Agree on a 3-Year Deal - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Yankees and Zach Britton Agree on a 3-Year Deal Supported by Yankees and Zach Britton Agree on a 3-Year Deal Image Zach Britton after getting a double play to close out a Yankees win over the Red Sox in September.CreditCreditJim Mcisaac/Getty Images By Tyler Kepner Jan. 5, 2019 The Yankees retained one of their best relievers, reaching an agreement Saturday night on a contract with the left-hander Zach Britton. The deal guarantees Britton three years and $39 million. The agreement was confirmed by a person with direct knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to comment publicly until Britton passes a physical examination. The Yankees will have an option, after the 2020 season, to extend the deal to four years and $53 million. If they do not, Britton could then exercise an out clause. Britton, 31, had a 2.88 earned run average in 25 games with the Yankees last season after coming to New York in late July in a trade from the Baltimore Orioles. He ruptured his Achilles’ tendon in an off-season workout in December 2017 but proved he was healthy last summer, retaining the power sinker that hitters struggle to elevate. Britton, who had 120 saves from 2014 through 2016, has allowed just 12 home runs in 283 games over the last five seasons. His return follows the departure on Thursday of David Robertson, the veteran setup man who left for a two-year, $23 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. Even so, with Britton, Dellin Betances and closer Aroldis Chapman, the Yankees have three relievers who have made multiple All-Star teams, supporting a rotation that includes Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka, James Paxton, J.A. Happ, C.C. Sabathia and Sonny Gray, whom the team is trying to trade.

sport Timberwolves fire head coach Tom Thibodeau Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Timberwolves fire head coach and president Tom Thibodeau after three years Ben WeinribYahoo SportsJanuary 7, 2019, 12:16 AM GMT Over a year ago, coach and president of basketball operations Tom Thibodeau went all-in on the Minnesota Timberwolves winning now by cashing in several trade chips for Jimmy Butler. And after the superstar forced his way out of Minnesota earlier this season, Thibodeau’s days were seemingly numbered, but now things have reached a breaking point. On Sunday night, the Timberwolves let Thibodeau go after a rough first three years with the franchise. Despite a 22-point win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Timberwolves CEO Ethan Casson delivered the news to Thibodeau in his office after the game, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Scroll to continue with content Ad NEWS: Timberwolves relieve Tom Thibodeau of his duties. Assistant Coach Ryan Saunders will assume the role of interim head coach for the remainder of the 2018-19 season. Full release: pic.twitter.com/sleIVTH1sM — Timberwolves PR (@Twolves_PR) January 7, 2019 General manager Scott Layden will remain at his post, and assistant Ryan Saunders, son of late former Minnesota coach Flip Saunders, will serve as the interim head coach. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves already have their eyes on another head coach with connections to Minnesota: Fred Hoiberg. Thibodeau’s time was running out Thibodeau has long been known for his intensity and defensive expertise, but things never quite clicked after he was hired in the summer of 2016. With former No. 1 overall picks Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins ready to blossom, Thibodeau was brought in elevate the team to the next level. The Timberwolves will reportedly fire Tom Thibodeau after a rocky first three years as head coach and president of basketball operations. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Story continues However, Minnesota only improved by two games to 31-51 in Thibs’ first year. Thibodeau orchestrated a draft-day trade prior to his second year for one of his favorite players from his days with the Chicago Bulls, Butler, as he sent three lottery picks to the Windy City. The Timberwolves did make the playoffs in 2018, but they lost in the first round, 4-1 to the Houston Rockets. Things quickly unraveled this past summer, when Butler asked for a trade and was more outspoken about his beefs with teammates Towns and Wiggins. Thibodeau could not convince Butler to play out his last year under contract in Minnesota and eventually traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for Robert Covington and Dario Saric. After holding a .573 winning percentage last season, the Timberwolves are just 19-21 this campaign. And even though they improved to 15-12 after the trade, the writing was on the wall with Minnesota currently sitting in the 11-seed and a game back of the second-worst record in the hyper-competitive Western Conference. Why fire Thibodeau now? The timing of the firing does seem a bit odd — why not fire Thibodeau immediately after the Butler fallout or let him figure out the new roster? But the iron may have been hot if the Timberwolves wanted to hire their top choice. According to Wojnarowski, former Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg is under serious consideration for either the Timberwolves’ head coach or GM position, as is former All-Star point guard Chauncey Billups. Before Hoiberg coached the Bulls and at Iowa State, he was an assistant general manager with the Wolves, and he could keep Saunders on as the associate head coach. After UCLA fired Steve Alford a week ago, the Bruins have had their eyes on the former Big 12 Coach of the Year. So this would be the opportunity for the Timberwolves to get their man before he finds a new home elsewhere. Hoiberg went 115-56 (.673) and made the NCAA Tournament four out of five years at Iowa State but struggled to a 115-155 (.426) record with the Bulls. He only made the playoffs once and was fired in December after a 5-19 start. Still, he is intimately familiar with the Timberwolves having played his last two seasons with the team and spending time in their front office.

Let’s Count the Ways. - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|This Bears Loss Was Particularly Soul-Crushing. Let’s Count the Ways. Supported by This Bears Loss Was Particularly Soul-Crushing. Let’s Count the Ways. Image Bears kicker Cody Parkey couldn’t believe he missed what would have been the game-winning field goal on Sunday.CreditCreditMike Dinovo/USA Today Sports, via Reuters By Victor Mather Jan. 7, 2019 There are tough ways to lose, and there are tougher ways to lose. And then there’s what the Bears lived through on Sunday in front of their hometown fans when Cody Parkey missed a 43-yard game winning field goal in the dying seconds of their wild card playoff game against the Eagles. Think you’ve suffered as a fan? Here are some reasons the Bears now have you beat. The kick hit the upright. And the crossbar. It was so nearly good. The kick was inches away from success, striking the left upright. But even then it had a chance, descending to smack the crossbar and falling ... on the wrong side of it. Eagles 16, Bears 15. A slight adjustment by Parkey and it might have been good. Had Treyvon Hester of the Eagles not got a little piece of the ball, the trajectory would have been different, and it might have been good. Had the Eagles not called time out before the Bears’ first snap, had Parkey not gone ahead and kicked that one (and made it) ... any little thing could be the difference when the difference is inches. The previous standard-setter for kicking agony, Scott Norwood’s failed game-winner in Super Bowl XXV for the Bills, at least was a clean miss. “You can’t make this up,” Parkey said. “I feel terrible.” It wasn’t the first time. Parkey missed two field goals and two extra points against the Lions earlier in the season. Somehow all four of those misses hit the upright as well. In Week 17 he did it again against the Vikings. Parkey had been hot. Earlier in the game, he had hit field goals of 36, 29 and 34 yards, accounting for 9 of the Bears 15 points. The Bears were the better team. Chicago seemed poised for a solid playoff run. It was a 6-point favorite over Philadelphia, the biggest spread of the round. The Bears were 12-4 in the regular season and had won nine of their last 10, and had lost only one home game this season. The Eagles shouldn’t even have been there. Philadelphia had to win five of their last six to sneak into the playoffs at 9-7. Even then, the Eagles would have been out had the Vikings managed to win in the final week of the season. But the Vikings lost. To the Bears. Oops. The Bears are in desperate need of playoff success. The proud franchise was returning to the playoffs for the first time in eight years. After seasons with three and five wins, fans were convinced that young quarterback Mitch Trubisky was ready to bring that success. It isn’t even the record. Well, two bangs off the goal post may be the N.F.L. record. But Ivan Perisic of Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga hit a shot in 2014 that struck the crossbar and both posts, for the major sports record of three. There was no silver lining. In the second most famous kicking incident in N.F.L. history (after Norwood’s wide right), Garo Yepremian of the Dolphins had a field goal attempt blocked in Super Bowl VII, then inexplicably picked it up and tried to pass it, resulting in a pick six that put the Redskins back in the game. But the incident is remembered fondly because of the comic sight of the undersized Yepremian trying to pass and because the Dolphins won the game to complete the N.F.L.’s only perfect season. It’s hard to see Bears fans remembering this game fondly. Even the mascot was devastated. As the ball hurtled through the air, mascot Staley da Bear, carefully positioned right under the goal posts, lifted his arms to indicate “good.” When the kick was in fact not good, Staley fell over, flat on the ground, his feet in the air. Internet fans who weren’t so invested in the game quickly hailed Staley as the true hero of the moment, praising his comic timing. Perhaps there’s a silver lining after all. The Bears said they were “respectfully passing” on a request to interview Staley.

sport David Silva, Manchester City’s Key Piece, Is Now More Valuable Than Ever - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|David Silva, Manchester City’s Key Piece, Is Now More Valuable Than Ever Supported by On Soccer David Silva, Manchester City’s Key Piece, Is Now More Valuable Than Ever Image David Silva, not any one of his flashier teammates, may be the key to Manchester City’s title hopes.CreditCreditNigel Roddis/EPA, via Shutterstock By Rory Smith Jan. 2, 2019 MANCHESTER, England — A few weeks ago, before Manchester City’s serene season hit unexpected turbulence, David Silva ran into the parents of the club’s bright midfield hope, Phil Foden, after yet another routine Premier League win. Silva is, both in private and in public, a quiet soul. He does not court the limelight — he consents to only one regular interview opportunity a year, a brief chat to promote tourism on the Canary Islands, where he grew up, in which he does his best to say nothing — or especially enjoy being the center of attention. With Foden’s mother, Claire, though, he was effusive. He told her what a pleasure it was to train alongside her teenage son, and enthused at the prospect of just how good a player he thought Foden could become. Less than a year after Foden had made his debut for City, Silva said he was already convinced that the 18-year-old had the potential to go on to be one of the best players in the world. His only hope, he told her, was that she might ask her son to “wait a couple of years” before blossoming. “Just to give me a chance,” he said. Image Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola relies on Silva to knit together all of the complex passing patterns he has drummed into his players.CreditCarl Recine/Reuters There is a timeless quality to Silva. He turns 33 next week, but still seems the player he was when he first arrived in Manchester almost nine years ago. He is no less sharp, no less lively, no less fluent: “always in motion,” as his one time Spain teammate, Javi Martinez, once said. He still wears his brilliance lightly. He still sees no need to indulge in ornament or ostentation. His is a genius for simple things, done to perfection. To his coach, Pep Guardiola, Silva is a “joy” to work with; to his teammates, as Kyle Walker put it, he is an “example.” He has been a central figure at City ever since he arrived in 2010, but if anything he is even more integral now, charged with knitting together all of the complex passing patterns Guardiola has drummed into his players. It is no surprise that it was in his absence — as well as that of Fernandinho, another of City’s old stagers — because of a leg injury that City lost to Crystal Palace and Leicester City, offering Liverpool daylight at the summit of the Premier League, and turning the two teams’ meeting at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday into a game Silva and his teammates must win. “If we drop points, it’s over, almost impossible,” Guardiola said this week. Even City, with all its resources, lacks something in Silva’s absence. “He is one of the most incredible players in the world at playing in the pockets,” Guardiola said of his playmaker earlier this season. “He is maybe the strongest in the world in those spaces. We try to attack those spaces: he is a master of it. Few players can do it.” Silva’s talent is not his only source of influence: around the same time he was greeting Foden’s mother, Silva presented each of his teammates with a personalized Nintendo Switch console, inscribed with their initials, and two games. Silva is not much of a gamer himself, but he knew many of the younger players are; he felt the chance to play alongside and against each other might help the team bond on away trips. The gesture was not advertised or announced to the team: the gifts came as a surprise. Silva made it as he plays a pass: with delicacy and discretion, not for its own sake but toward a greater goal. Those are the traits on which he has built his career, that have led him to a World Cup title, two European Championships and three Premier League titles. But they are the characteristics, too, that may stop him from receiving the individual recognition he perhaps deserves. Roberto Mancini, one of Guardiola’s predecessors at City and the manager who brought Silva to England from Valencia in 2010, always regarded his playmaker as the equal of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. “If he had gone to Barcelona” in 2008, Mancini said, “everyone would be saying he is one of the best players in the world.” Silva has rarely — if ever — been mentioned in that conversation, even in dispatches. Indeed, remarkably, in nine years in England he has only once — back in September 2011 — managed to be voted the Premier League’s player of the month. He has won that award as often as such luminaries as Nikica Jelavic, Adam Le Fondre and Connor Wickham. He has, needless to say, never been voted the country’s player of the year. And yet there is a case to be made that Silva ranks not just among the finest players of this Premier League generation, but among the greatest-ever imports into English soccer. True, he cannot match the transformative effect Eric Cantona had on the game when he arrived — first at Leeds United, in 1992, and then at Manchester United — and true, he has not scored as frequently or played as explosively as the likes of Thierry Henry or Didier Drogba. He may not be as decorated as Peter Schmeichel — who picked up five Premier League titles at Manchester United — or produced as many moments of jaw-dropping wonder as Dennis Bergkamp. Unlike Cristiano Ronaldo, he has not led his team to the Champions League crown, or gone on to score more goals in that competition than anyone else. There are other ways, though, to gauge greatness. Never mind that Silva has won more Premier League titles than Henry, and as many as Ronaldo and Patrick Vieira. Image Silva has spent nearly a decade driving Manchester City’s success.CreditNeil Hall/EPA, via Shutterstock Much more significant is the fact that, over the last decade, nobody has created more goals in the Premier League than the elfin Spaniard; only two foreign players — Bergkamp and Cesc Fàbregas — have more assists in English history. Never mind that he has lasted longer in the tumult of English soccer than almost any of his rival candidates (only Vieira remains ahead of him, for now). Far more important is that he has done so despite being adjudged, in some quarters, as too lightweight for the fray when he first arrived. Silva has — not uniquely, but more than most — changed the way the Premier League sees itself; he has played a role in ending the tyranny of the powerhouse. He has not just helped to define and refine the playing style with which City is now synonymous, but proved that small, technical players can thrive in England. “You can see his quality from how long he has survived in the Premier League,” Guardiola said. “If you survive, it is because you are a better player. When he moves, it is clever, more intelligent. When you see things like he does, it is because you are more intelligent than the others.” That he is so easily overlooked — when Alan Shearer nominated a player to enter that pantheon last year, he went for Silva’s teammate Sergio Agüero — is in part because of the person Silva is: shy, private, not given to grand public declarations of his genius. But it is also because of the player he is. Silva does not pretend to be a great soloist; he does not play to the gallery or for his personal highlights reel. He is not especially quick or frighteningly strong or ruthlessly productive. He is, instead, an embodiment of that old Guardiola maxim: He takes the ball; he passes the ball. The better he plays, the brighter others shine. It has been easy to lose sight of him, a player who seeks nothing but to be a part of the collective, but he has always been at the heart of it. It is hard to tell, but he is slowly descending from the peak he has occupied for almost a decade. Even he thinks he has just a couple of years left before he is replaced. He may be right: Foden may go on to be one of the best in the world. Silva, though, will prove a tough act to follow.

sport Is UConn’s Dominance of Women’s Basketball Over? Cue Eye Rolls, for Now - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Is UConn’s Dominance of Women’s Basketball Over? Cue Eye Rolls, for Now Supported by On College Basketball Is UConn’s Dominance of Women’s Basketball Over? Cue Eye Rolls, for Now Image Under Coach Geno Auriemma, UConn has won 11 national championships.CreditCreditStephen Dunn/Associated Press By Jeré Longman Dec. 2, 2018 HARTFORD — The news struck the Connecticut faithful like a punch. Haley Jones, a 6-foot-1 wing player from Santa Cruz, Calif., who is considered the top women’s basketball recruit in the country, chose Stanford over UConn on Wednesday. That followed a recent decision by another top recruit, Aliyah Boston, a 6-4 post player from Worcester, Mass., to play for South Carolina instead of the Huskies. Which followed the departure last spring of the 6-6 Azura Stevens to the W.N.B.A. with a season of eligibility remaining. Which inflamed the sting of last-second defeats to Notre Dame and Mississippi State in the past two national semifinals. These, of course, are first-world problems. No one is throwing a pity party for the Huskies. But the futile recruiting of Jones seemed to bring rare and existential alarm to UConn fans. “I’ve had people tell me UConn basketball is dead,” said Daniel Connolly, a student who is a reporter and editor for The UConn Blog. “A certain sector of the Twitter-verse is definitely panicking.” Image UConn’s Crystal Dangerfield during a 99-63 rout of 16th-ranked DePaul on Wednesday.CreditJessica Hill/Associated Press Connolly sat along press row Wednesday night at Hartford’s XL Center as the second-ranked Huskies (6-0) dismantled No. 16 DePaul. It was a final tuneup for Sunday’s trip to face top-ranked Notre Dame (7-0), the defending national champion, in the sport’s premier matchup. Asked about potholes along the recruiting trail, Coach Geno Auriemma answered with the mock despair of a coach who has won 11 national championships and has averaged 30-plus victories a season for more than three decades. “What can I say?” Auriemma said. “It’s over.” It does seem rash to predict UConn’s imminent demise. Yet Auriemma and the Huskies awakened Thursday to headlines that would have been unthinkable days or even hours earlier, asking whether the recruiting setbacks meant the “beginning of the end” for the coach and his team. Doug Bruno, the longtime DePaul coach, urged a tapping of the brakes on doom and gloom. “Geno’s not in it to finish second,” he said. Still, an undeniable leveling is occurring in women’s college basketball. Tennessee, the winner of eight national titles, has not reached the Final Four since Pat Summitt retired in 2012 with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. (She died in 2016.) Stanford, a two-time N.C.A.A. champion and Final Four regular, no longer dominates the Pacific-12 Conference and won its last title in 1992. Buffalo and Central Michigan, both 11 seeds, reached the regional semifinals in the 2018 tournament. UConn would surprise no one by winning its 12th N.C.A.A. title this season. But the Huskies have lost the sheen of invincibility, especially to Notre Dame, which played the Huskies, its fiercest rival, as many as four times a season when they both belonged to the Big East Conference. “You have to believe you can win, and I think that starts with me,” Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw said Friday. “Some people are intimidated by their name, by what they’ve accomplished. And we’re not.” Image Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw has her team atop the national rankings ahead of a Sunday showdown against No. 2 UConn.CreditRobert Franklin/Associated Press Parity creeps like ivy. Dawn Staley coached South Carolina to its first N.C.A.A. title in 2017. And Notre Dame won its second title this spring, 17 years after its first. “You can feel good that we’ve had two different winners the last two years,” McGraw said. “I think it’s really good for the game. It brings more excitement.” Auriemma understands as acutely as anyone that UConn’s dominance has a sell-by date. He has the arc of history as confirmation. In the first 35 years of the men’s N.C.A.A. tournament, U.C.L.A. won 10 championships, but it has won only one since 1975. In the first 35 years of the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament, UConn won 11 titles, the most recent in 2016. How will the future play out? Well, Auriemma is 64. Whenever he leaves, almost no one expects the Huskies to remain a major force if they stay in a middling league like the American Athletic Conference, trying to remain competitive against the financial resources and verdant campuses of the Southeastern Conference, the Pac-12, the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big Ten and the Big 12. Enjoy UConn’s success, Auriemma admonished Huskies fans last season, because “this isn’t going to last forever.” The recent blip only reinforces how difficult it is to stay on top, Auriemma said. Since the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament began in 1982, only three schools have won consecutive titles: Southern Cal, Tennessee and UConn. Image Haley Jones, right, talking with South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley. Jones, considered the top recruit in women’s basketball, committed to Stanford on Wednesday.CreditSean Rayford/Associated Press “So you go through some cycles; you’re supposed to,” Auriemma said. “Every single team in America in the last 25 years has gone through some cycle where they’ve not been good, except us. So how do you explain that? And the more you do that, the more it’s out there that it’s supposed to last forever.” Recruiting has grown more complicated. Auriemma prefers to be viewed as an instructor, not as a friend, to his players. But many of today’s recruits, McGraw said, talk of building relationships with their college coaches. “They had that in high school,” she said. “They are looking to be wooed a little bit more. You’re seeing more and more kids, and parents, that love the attention.” Staley of South Carolina, who just signed four of the 13 top-rated high school stars, told The State newspaper about the full-court press that her assistant coaches applied to those recruits, “talking to every single person that’s involved in their lives.” In Auriemma’s view, recruiting has become “too corporate; too many people involved in the process.” But he also remains convinced that he will stock UConn’s roster next season with top-shelf talent, perhaps including graduate transfers and international players. “I’m not worried about that,” he said. This period of uncertainty — and the chance that it is temporary — reminds Auriemma of a stretch after Diana Taurasi had left for the W.N.B.A. in 2004. With her, the Huskies won three consecutive N.C.A.A. titles. Without her, they did not win another national championship for four consecutive seasons. “I read that the program is done, it’s over,” Auriemma said. Except it wasn’t. Maya Moore arrived and UConn won championships in 2009 and 2010. Then Breanna Stewart led the Huskies to four consecutive titles from 2013 through 2016. Winning streaks seemed boundless. “We fell on hard times,” Auriemma said with familiar snark. “It was like we went through a deep depression. We should have won 200 in a row; we only won 111.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: In the Women’s Game, Nobody Is Feeling UConn’s Pain.

Stat Can Confirm Your Amazement  - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|How Did He Catch That? A New N.F.L. Stat Can Confirm Your Amazement Supported by How Did He Catch That? A New N.F.L. Stat Can Confirm Your Amazement By Ben Shpigel Nov. 30, 2018 Image Keenan Allen of the Chargers. Yeah, he made the catch.CreditPeter B Joneleit/Associated Press Philip Rivers’s 4-yard touchdown to Keenan Allen in the Los Angeles Chargers’ 45-10 victory last Sunday tied the N.F.L. record for consecutive completions to start a game, with 25. It was the kind of play that warranted several viewings, just to marvel at Rivers’s synchronicity with Allen. It also harbored another distinction: the most improbable completion of Week 12. Just how improbable was determined within seconds, by tracking devices embedded in the football, the players’ shoulder pads and the goal-line pylons, among many other places. Those devices collect data like the quarterback’s foot speed at the time he releases the ball, how much time he has to throw and the distance to the receiver. If, for instance, a quarterback is running faster than 8 miles an hour when he throws, his chances of completing the pass drop. The devices also collect data related to the receiver, including the space between him and the nearest defender and the distance separating him from the sideline. The closer a receiver is to the sideline, the lower the likelihood of his catching the pass. All that data is funneled through a machine learning model, which weighs those factors (and others) against similar information about more than 35,000 pass attempts to calculate the probability of a completion. Unveiled this season on the N.F.L.’s Next Gen Stats platform, completion probability is in the nascent stages of being unpacked for greater meaning — the frequency of improbable throws toward a particular receiver, perhaps, or a measure of a quarterback’s willingness to make dicey passes. For now, completion probability is more frivolous than illuminating, a nifty bit of trivia. But it could eventually become a scouting tool. “On a play level, it’s kind of fun to see how hard that pass was,” said Matt Swensson, the N.F.L.’s vice president of emerging products and technology. “At another level, it tells a story of these guys and their inclination to take risks and whether or not they’re able to convert that or not.” The quarterbacks with that inclination this season run the gamut in pedigree, from Case Keenum to Aaron Rodgers, each of whom has delivered some of the more improbable completions in the league. But since the model values certain factors more than others, Swensson said, there is not always a correlation between a spectacular catch and a low completion probability. If a quarterback throws from a clean pocket or if the receiver catches the ball in the middle of the field, the play’s success will not be viewed as unlikely as, say, that of Keenum’s 4-yard laser on the run to Demaryius Thomas for a touchdown in Week 1. “There’s definitely a high degree of confidence in this,” Swensson said of the assessments, “but there’s not really a magic formula.” In the case of Rivers and Allen, their touchdown contained all the elements. Rivers faked a handoff, looked left, then rolled right, almost reaching the sideline. He was running at 14.22 miles an hour when he fired the ball 16.6 yards through the air to Allen, who caught it on the boundary of the end zone, his feet dragging inbounds as his body fell out. At the time the pass arrived, Allen was actually 0.3 yards out of bounds. Swensson said any catch with a 20 percent probability or less would be considered “pretty difficult.” The chances of Rivers’s completing that pass were a scant 14.5 percent. Still, it ranks as only the seventh-least probable completion this season. Here are the top five: Week 11 vs. Ravens 1. Bengals QB Andy Dalton to WR John Ross Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey covered Ross step for step down the sideline so well that he probably thought there was no chance Dalton would throw his way. Dalton did, and Ross rewarded his conviction, securing the ball against Humphrey’s arm as he came down in the end zone for a 22-yard touchdown. The primary factors contributing to the 12.3 percent completion probability, the lowest in the N.F.L. this season, were the 38.9 yards the ball traveled in the air, Ross’s 0.4 yards of separation from Humphrey and his 0.2 yards separation from the sideline. Week 2 vs. Packers 2. Vikings QB Kirk Cousins to WR Adam Thielen Late in the fourth quarter, with Minnesota trailing Green Bay by 29-21, Cousins dropped back to pass from his 22-yard line. Just as he got hit by defensive end Mike Daniels, Cousins released a throw off his back foot that went 42.2 yards in the air, sailing between two Packers defenders to nestle in the arms of Thielen, whose momentum carried him into the end zone as he caught it. The pass had a 12.4 percent chance of being completed, in large part because of Daniels’s proximity — 0.4 yards — to Cousins when he threw the ball and because of Thielen’s place on the field, 1.3 yards from the sideline and 1.2 yards from cornerback Jaire Alexander. Week 2 vs. Bengals 3. Ravens QB Joe Flacco to WR John Brown In the fourth quarter, Flacco connected with Brown on a 21-yard touchdown that defied belief. Bengals cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick was draped on Brown from the snap to the end zone, but Brown grabbed the ball over Kirkpatrick, reaching around his right arm to catch it. The completion had a 12.6 percent probability because of the 37.5 yards traveled by the ball, as well as Brown’s minimal separation from Kirkpatrick (0.7 yards) and from the sideline (0.5 yards). Week 7 vs. Lions 4. Dolphins QB Brock Osweiler to WR Kenny Stills Since guiding the Houston Texans to an A.F.C. South title in 2016, Osweiler hasn’t had many highlights. One, though, came against Detroit, in his second start for the Dolphins in relief of an injured Ryan Tannehill. In the second quarter, Osweiler flipped a 5-yard touchdown pass to Stills, who was running so fast toward the back corner of the end zone that he flattened a security guard facing the stands. The pass had a 12.7 percent chance of connecting because of the 31.7 yards it flew but also because of Stills’s 1.2 yards of separation from cornerback Darius Slay and how close he was to the back of the end zone when he made the catch just 0.5 yards inbounds. Week 2 vs. Patriots 5. Jaguars QB Blake Bortles to WR Keelan Cole This might just be the prettiest pass of Bortles’s career. Bortles, since demoted, lofted a 24-yard touchdown in the first quarter that soared over New England cornerback Eric Rowe and into the arms of Cole. The catch had a 14.1 percent possibility given Cole’s 0.8 yards of separation from Rowe and his 0.5 yards from the sideline; the 1.3 yards between Bortles and the nearest defender at the time of release; and the 43.9 yards the pass traveled in the air.

sport With Petrino Debacle, Not Being a Judge of Character Bites Louisville Again - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|With Petrino Debacle, Not Being a Judge of Character Bites Louisville Again Supported by On College Football With Petrino Debacle, Not Being a Judge of Character Bites Louisville Again Image Bobby Petrino was fired Sunday as football coach at Louisville. The Cardinals are 2-8.CreditCreditMichael Dwyer/Associated Press By Marc Tracy Nov. 12, 2018 Less than a year ago, Bobby Petrino was in a New York City ballroom waiting to see if his quarterback, Lamar Jackson, would win the Heisman Trophy. Jackson came in third, but that was O.K.: He had won it the year before, the first Louisville player to do so. And besides, in the previous four seasons with Petrino as their coach for the second time, the Cardinals had four winning campaigns, even as they joined the more competitive Atlantic Coast Conference. The highs Petrino achieved — he is undoubtedly an offensive mastermind — made the fall that much more stark. On Sunday morning, after a 54-23 shellacking by No. 12 Syracuse (8-2) brought the Cardinals to 2-8, Petrino was fired. “We owe it to our student-athletes and fans to get this turned around,” the athletic director, Vince Tyra, said in a statement. “I did not have the confidence that it was going to happen next season without a change, and it needs to start happening now.” Louisville plans to pay Petrino, who has not commented, the full cost of his contract buyout, which at a news conference Tyra estimated was about $14 million. The safeties coach Lorenzo Ward is the interim coach. It is not the most surprising or ignominious exit in Petrino’s career. He first became coach at Louisville before the 2003 season. He then left to be the coach of the Atlanta Falcons after leading the Cardinals to a 12-1 record and an Orange Bowl win in the 2006 season. He left his new job after less than one season as Louisville began a run of three nonwinning campaigns under Steve Kragthorpe. For many fans, Petrino’s name is synonymous with an ugly scandal that in 2012 ended his tenure at his next head coaching stop, Arkansas. There, a motorcycle crash led to revelations of an affair with a football staff member and related misdeeds, such as lying to his boss. No matter for Louisville: In 2014, when its coach, Charlie Strong, left for Texas after bringing the program back to college football’s heights with 11-2 and 12-1 records the previous two seasons, it rehired Petrino. The athletic director at the time, Tom Jurich, said that Petrino, who had been Western Kentucky’s coach for a year, convinced him that he was “a changed man.” Jurich also had previously hired Petrino, two years after having also snagged Rick Pitino as the men’s basketball coach. In recent years, Pitino was the focus of multiple scandals — such as the restaurant tryst, and allegations that a staff member paid for prostitutes to entertain recruits in on-campus housing. He also brought Louisville its third national championship, in 2013. As Petrino returned to the university, Jurich’s game plan became clear. It went roughly like this: As a former commuter college in an unfamiliar conference that has blue bloods in football (Clemson, Florida State, Virginia Tech) and basketball (Duke, North Carolina, Syracuse), Louisville could not afford to be squeamish when it came to the character of coaches who knew how to win. Where other teams might not have rehired Petrino or retained Pitino, Louisville would — and would thereby benefit from their undeniable acumen as other programs would not. It all blew up, starting a little more than a year ago. In summer 2017, the N.C.A.A. penalized Louisville for the prostitute scandal — of which Pitino had denied knowledge. It later formally revoked that 2013 national title, the only time it has vacated a Division I championship in its signature tournament, men’s basketball. A few months later, Louisville was at the center of the suspected network of bribes and misconduct in college basketball recruiting brought forth by federal prosecutors. Pitino and Jurich were ousted in October 2017. (Last month, the father of a Louisville recruit testified that he received money not only from Adidas, Louisville’s apparel sponsor, but also from Louisville’s former associate head coach.) On and off the football field, there were also early indications of trouble. The very night in December 2016 when Jackson won the Heisman, two players and a cheerleader were shot at a celebration. The Cardinals went on to lose their bowl game, making Jackson one of few modern Heisman winners whose team did not win at least 10 games. Football attendance fell last season and this one, even as a $64 million expansion was completed at Cardinal Stadium — which had been known as Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium before this summer, when the eponymous chief executive John Schnatter apologized for using a racial slur on a conference call and stepped down from the university’s board of trustees. It has been that kind of year. There is cause for the Louisville faithful to be optimistic, though. Tyra, a local businessman, managed to hire everyone’s ideal candidate for men’s basketball coach: Chris Mack, who grew up nearby, outside Cincinnati, and had made Xavier a top program. There is an even more obvious candidate to be the new football coach: Jeff Brohm, a Derby City native who starred as a Cardinals quarterback, returned later as quarterbacks coach under Petrino and is in his second year as coach of Purdue. Last year, the Boilermakers had their first winning season since 2011; this year, they are 5-5 with a dramatic win over No. 10 Ohio State (9-1) at home. At the same time, it was perhaps never quite realistic to expect Louisville to contend in football while playing in the same division as Florida State and Clemson. Clemson was the team with the offensive firepower when the two met last month, winning, 77-16. The No. 2 Tigers (10-0) give every indication of heading for their fourth consecutive A.C.C. title and trip to the College Football Playoff. “There’s a high standard out there,” Tyra said Sunday, adding, “We know we’re chasing Clemson.” Maybe that was part of the problem all along.

Roundup Henrik Lundqvist Is Pulled Again as Rangers Are Shut Out by Coyotes Image Filip Chytil of the Rangers could not get the puck past Coyotes goalie Darcy Kuemper, who stopped all 23 shots he faced in a 5-0 victory.CreditCreditRalph Freso/Associated Press By The Associated Press Jan. 6, 2019 Conor Garland scored twice and Darcy Kuemper made 23 saves for his first shutout of the season to lead the host Arizona Coyotes past the slumping Rangers, 5-0, on Sunday. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist stopped 27 of 32 shots before being replaced by Alexander Georgiev with 3 minutes 22 seconds left in the second period. Lundqvist also was pulled in his last start, a 7-2 loss to Pittsburgh, on Wednesday night. The Rangers have been outscored, 18-3, while losing three straight games and have lost six of eight and nine of 12. They were shut out for the third time this season. “We’re fragile mentally and physically right now, the ways things are going,” Rangers Coach David Quinn said. “There are a whole heap of problems, and we have to address them. We had no legs today. They had way more jump than we did. It was every man. We just didn’t have any energy. You can’t play with no energy in this league.” Alex Galchenyuk had a goal and two assists, and Mario Kempe and Clayton Keller also scored to help give Coach Rick Tocchet his 100th N.H.L. victory. The Coyotes ended a three-game skid and won for the second time in their last nine home games. Galchenyuk has 10 points in his last eight games, and Garland has three goals in his last two games and five in his last seven. Garland was recalled from Tucson of the American Hockey League early last month. “I feel more comfortable every game,” said Garland, a rookie. “You get to see film, talk to the coaches after a game and pick up new things. It is slowing down. It feels good.” Garland opened the scoring at 7:19 of the first period on a power play, tipping in Oliver Ekman-Larsson’s shot from the blue line. The Rangers have given up four power-play goals in the last two games — three in a 6-1 loss at Colorado on Friday night. Kempe made it 2-0 two minutes later when the Rangers could not clear a bouncing puck near the left circle. Kempe fired a wrist shot that beat Lundqvist high to the blocker side. Garland struck again at 6:34 of the second. His shot from the slot deflected off Kevin Shattenkirk’s stick and fluttered past Lundqvist. Galchenyuk’s poke check at his own blue line started the rush. Keller and Galchenyuk added goals in the period, Keller sending Lundqvist to the bench with a shot between the goalie’s legs. “We’re not starting very well, and it’s snowballing on us,” the Rangers’ Marc Staal said. Image Max Pacioretty, right, with Paul Stastny after scoring the winner for the Golden Knights in the second period against goalie Kris Kinkaid and the Devils.CreditEthan Miller/Getty Images GOLDEN KNIGHTS 3, DEVILS 2 Max Pacioretty broke a tie with 4:14 left in the second period and Malcolm Subban made 36 saves in his first home start since March 30 to help Vegas overcome a two-goal deficit. Set up in front of the net, Pacioretty capped a whirlwind weekend by redirecting Shea Theodore’s shot from the point past goalie Keith Kinkaid. After missing seven games because of a lower-body injury, Pacioretty scored the winner Friday night in his return at Anaheim, then rushed back to Las Vegas in time to see son Michael born at 2 a.m. Saturday. The next day, it was back to business with another winning goal. “It’s just a weekend to remember,” Pacioretty said. “I’m happy that he is here finally and happy that everyone is home, happy and healthy.” Ryan Reaves added his career-high eighth goal, and Brayden McNabb scored his first goal of the season. Vegas improved to 17-3-3 since Nov. 21. Nico Hischier and Ben Lovejoy scored, and Kinkaid made 25 saves for the Devils, who were without the star Taylor Hill for the sixth game in a row. He remains day to day with a lower-body injury. Hischier opened the scoring early in the first period with a one-timer over Subban. Later in the period, Subban was caught in the splits, leaving a wide-open net for Lovejoy. Shortly after Reaves had a goal waved off because the whistle blew before the puck crossed the goal line, he got one to trickle between Kinkaid’s legs. McNabb tied it in the second period with a shot from the point. The goal was initially waved off because of goaltender interference by Ryan Carpenter, but the call was overturned on a coach’s challenge.

sport As Men’s Team Tennis Events Rise, the Coed Hopman Cup Is Left in Limbo - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|As Men’s Team Tennis Events Rise, the Coed Hopman Cup Is Left in Limbo Supported by As Men’s Team Tennis Events Rise, the Coed Hopman Cup Is Left in Limbo Image This year’s Hopman Cup featured Serena Williams, top left, and Frances Tiafoe facing Roger Federer, bottom right, and Belinda Bencic in a mixed doubles match.CreditCreditTrevor Collens/Associated Press By Ben Rothenberg Jan. 5, 2019 PERTH, Australia — When Serena Williams and Roger Federer played against each other for the first time, on Tuesday night at the Hopman Cup, it was the ultimate expression of an event that has brought the best men and best women in tennis together for more than three decades. But despite the power of seeing Williams and Federer on opposite sides of the net, the future of the Hopman Cup is uncertain, with a new men’s team event set to eclipse it, part of a trend of realignment and reinvention in tennis. Tennis Australia, which manages the Hopman Cup, will next year help organize the ATP Cup, a 10-day tournament that will have men’s teams from 24 countries competing across three Australian cities for ranking points and $15 million in prize money. With mixed doubles increasingly outstripped in prize money and prestige at Grand Slam events, the Hopman Cup — with two-person teams from eight countries competing in singles and mixed doubles — is the lone place to see top men and top women team up besides the Olympics. Though Federer did not participate in the Hopman Cup through the middle years of his career, he has a long attachment to the event, first coming to Perth as a hitting partner in 1999. He won the tournament with Martina Hingis in 2001 about a month before taking his first title on the ATP Tour. At the next Hopman Cup, he partnered with his future wife, Mirka Vavrinec. [Read: Roger Federer struggles with Serena Williams’s serve. And vice versa.] “Men and women, we share a lot of tournaments together, but it’s not the same as when you play each other or share the same court,” Federer said. “So I think the players have always enjoyed this event.” The Hopman Cup’s distinction as a mixed event stands in contrast to the trend of new team tennis concepts for men only. Tennis Australia has taken an aggressive role in event creation, cofounding the men-only Laver Cup and the ATP Cup in recent years. That focus on men’s tennis could doom the coed Hopman Cup. The host cities for the ATP Cup have not yet been announced, but the state-of-the-art Perth Arena, where the Hopman Cup has been held since 2013, is a likely choice. Even if Perth is not chosen, it would be difficult to imagine Tennis Australia hosting two competing team events in the same week. The Hopman Cup remains an oddity in its 31st year, at once a playful exhibition that serves as a relaxing lead-up to the Australian Open and, since 1997, an officially sanctioned International Tennis Federation event. The tournament has been bankrolled by the Western Australian government’s tourism body, Tourism W.A. Player appearance contracts have included clauses forbidding them from criticizing Perth, and at times the programming can feel like an infomercial for the region. After his first match at this year’s tournament, Federer gave an on-court interview that centered on his appreciation for the region and a photo shoot at a scenic rock formation nearby. Among locals, the main concern is less about preserving the Hopman Cup and more about making sure that isolated Perth, which is 1,300 miles from another city of more than 100,000 people, keeps a foothold in tennis and is not left out of the pre-Australian Open swing. In the wider tennis community, the Hopman Cup’s uniqueness is appreciated. It has rarely sparked the tribal passions on which Davis Cup prides itself, but the Hopman Cup has been a crowd-pleasing event, cherished by tennis fans who have savored the opportunity to see the sport’s top women and top men compete and commingle. The New Year’s Day battle of Williams and Frances Tiafoe against Federer and Belinda Bencic represented an apex of many captivating Hopman Cup combinations. Marat Safin and Dinara Safina, the only brother-sister pair to both reach the No. 1 ranking, played together for Russia in 2009. Boris Becker and Steffi Graf played together in 1992 for the only time in their careers, a pairing of stars so sought after that a German television station helped the tournament organizers pay the players’ appearance fees. The tournament has also featured some irresistible matchups of men’s and women’s stars who would never otherwise intersect. In the 2011 final, the 5-foot-5 Justine Henin tried to return the booming serve of the 6-foot-10 John Isner. Not everyone is ready to write an obituary for the event, though. David Haggerty, president of the I.T.F., which sanctions the Hopman Cup as its official mixed team competition, said the event was “very, very important and should continue.” Haggerty said he expected Tennis Australia to honor its remaining contractual obligations for managing the Hopman Cup in the first week of the season, which run through 2022. “We’re just excited to continue to see Hopman Cup through because it is a great way to have the men and women playing,” said Haggerty, who spearheaded a massive overhaul of the Davis Cup format last year despite strong resistance from governing bodies, including Tennis Australia. If Saturday’s final was the event’s last gasp, it had a breathtaking finish, with Federer and Bencic prevailing in an 18-shot rally on a winner-take-all final point against Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber, clinching a second straight title for the Swiss pair. Tennis Australia’s Paul Kilderry, who serves as the Hopman Cup’s tournament director, declined to comment for this article, citing uncertainty about the tournament’s future. As Haggerty expressed reason for the Hopman Cup to endure, Ross Hutchins, the ATP vice president for player relations, was scouting Perth Arena as a potential venue for the ATP Cup, for which he will be managing director. Hutchins is also visiting Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney, which all have existing tennis facilities. “Ultimately we thought this time of year, leading into a Grand Slam, is important to do something major in, and that’s what we will target,” Hutchins said. “This event will be a major event on the ATP Tour.” The ATP Cup is landing in a jam-packed first week of the tennis season, which this year has seven tournaments: the Hopman Cup; WTA tournaments in Auckland, New Zealand, and Shenzhen, China; ATP tournaments in Doha, Qatar, and Pune, India; and a combined ATP-WTA tournament in Brisbane. Hutchins said only one of the ATP events would remain on the schedule as a complement to the ATP Cup, with no survivor yet designated. Image Federer won the Hopman Cup with Martina Hingis in 2001.CreditSean Garnsworthy/Getty Images The ATP is eager to add more events that it will own outright. The ATP Cup will be the third new annual men’s team event introduced since 2017. The Federer-backed Laver Cup, which pits a European team against one from the rest of the world, is held in September. The reworked 18-country Davis Cup will culminate in November. Hutchins said he thought there was room for all three to flourish. “I don’t think there is a fatigue of team events because it’s not something that we think is diluted, and they’re all slightly different,” he said. But there is nothing quite like the Hopman Cup on the horizon. Without any fixed plans for the event’s end or its continuation, players and organizers at this year’s tournament participated with a mixture of wistfulness and confusion. In the afterglow of her match with Federer, Williams was caught off-guard by a question about the Hopman Cup’s probable demise. “Oh, really? I never heard that,” Williams said. “It would be heartbreaking.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP7 of the New York edition with the headline: With the Schedule Changing, a Unique Event in Australia Faces Extinction.

It Belongs to Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning. Supported by On College Basketball A Mighty Tree Grows in Georgetown. It Belongs to Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning. Image Trey Mourning wears No. 33, as his father and his head coach, Uncle Patrick, did when they were at Georgetown.CreditCreditMitchell Layton/Getty Images By Harvey Araton Jan. 3, 2019 WASHINGTON — Trey Mourning had one foot out the door at Georgetown when Uncle Patrick became Coach Ewing. He turned around and went to a team meeting. Ewing-Mourning roots run deep at Georgetown. But they also intersect at a crucial moment in the N.B.A.’s evolution on the court and are thicker, even, than the figurative blood that was spilled in one of the most ferocious rivalries in league history. That warfare involved the Knicks and the Miami Heat. Every N.B.A. playoffs from 1997 to 2000 featured — among other ultimate fighting showdowns occasionally resembling basketball — a main event involving two throwback centers: Patrick Ewing and Trey’s father, Alonzo, both of Georgetown pedigree. A decade and a half later, after a dominant career at Ransom Everglades, a prep school in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood, Trey Mourning enrolled at Georgetown in 2014, months before his father was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. He did so essentially for three reasons: the university’s academic reputation, his family legacy and extended family relationships. John Thompson III was the head coach at Georgetown, but more of an enticement, Trey Mourning said, was the presence on the staff of Ewing’s son, Patrick Jr. “The Ewings are like family to me,” he said. “The Thompsons are family, but I use air quotes. That’s kind of how I look at it.” Image Alonzo Mourning, left, and Patrick Ewing in 1997, during one of the fierce playoff battles between the Knicks and the Heat.CreditRoberto Schmidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Over the next three seasons, he proceeded to mostly ride Thompson’s bench, registering no more than the 5.9 minutes he logged per game as a sophomore. With his senior year approaching, he was loath to conclude his college career without much time on the court, without opportunity. It is, however, a complex web that Georgetown weaves. Thompson was relieved after the 2016-17 season and replaced by Patrick Ewing, a hire inspired by Thompson’s father, known around campus as Big John, who coached Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning at Georgetown and remains a mentor to both. Suddenly, Trey Mourning, a 6-foot-9 forward, had a more difficult decision to make regarding a potential transfer. Though Patrick Jr.’s assistant coaching position would be eliminated because of an anti-nepotism policy, the young Mourning could not dismiss the chance to play under the senior Ewing, who is actually listed in Trey’s smartphone as Uncle Patrick. They had a private sit-down, during which Ewing told him, “Put in the work, you’ll play.” No problem, Trey thought. If there was one thing ingrained in him by his father, it was an ethic that across 15 N.B.A. seasons of low-post warfare was best exemplified by Alonzo Mourning’s refusal to pack it in after a kidney transplant in 2003. Trey wound up sitting out his senior year at Georgetown with a hip injury, but he had been starting as a graduate student this season. He averaged 23.5 minutes, 7.7 points and 5.4 rebounds a game in the team’s first 11 games, but was idled recently by a concussion — his status is “day-to-day.” (Georgetown is 11-3 over all as it enters an early but important Big East matchup with St. John’s, which is 13-1 over all, on Saturday afternoon in Washington.) In a game against Campbell on Nov. 24, Mourning had career highs of 27 points and 12 rebounds. Watching was his father, who works in Miami for the Heat and sat in the stands at Washington’s Capital One Arena for the only time this season, along with Trey’s brother, Alijah. “Sweetest night so far,” Trey said. Trey Mourning’s game is less bullish than his father’s, reflecting the sport’s dramatic shift since those Heat-Knicks conflagrations, which often ended with neither team within squinting view of 90 points, much less 100. Compelling as the games were, unequaled at the time in raw intensity, they contributed mightily to N.B.A. rule changes in 2004 and the contemporary mix of unimpeded driving and long-distance shooting. Image Ewing, left, became the Georgetown coach last season.CreditChris Szagola/Associated Press “The N.B.A. did what they did because they wanted to make sure fans would come,” Ewing said. “It worked — look how popular it is. But I still get people coming up to me, saying they miss those days.” He and his buddy Alonzo can reminisce all they want about the punishment Michael Jordan absorbed against the Knicks’ and the Heat’s brutish defenses. It would be different now. “Imagine what Michael would do in today’s N.B.A.,’’ Mourning said in a telephone interview. ”He’d probably average 50.” And what can Ewing — 56 and hoping for head-coaching longevity — do but go with the flow? Trey Mourning, in fact, recalled working on low-post defense in high school with his father while a visiting Ewing watched from the sideline. “Patrick would be sitting there and, knowing the rule book, being a coach in the N.B.A., he’d say, ‘Oh, no, we can’t teach him that way, that’s illegal,’” Trey said. But in the 1990s, little seemed out of line, or beyond the realm of anarchic possibility, when Pat Riley’s Heat and Jeff Van Gundy’s Knicks staged an N.B.A. production of the Hatfields and McCoys — although the rivalry was also a knockoff of “All in the Family.” Besides the Ewing-Mourning connection, Riley coached the Knicks from 1991 to 1995 before moving to Miami, and Van Gundy, his assistant in New York, held the job until 2001. In Miami, Riley hired another Van Gundy — Jeff’s brother, Stan. There was a night in May 1999 when the Heat pulled away in the fourth quarter to force a decisive fifth game of a first-round playoff series, and the Knicks’ Latrell Sprewell, out of frustration and just for the fun of it, slammed the Heat’s Terry Porter to the floor on a fast break. A furious Stan Van Gundy bolted upright from his seat next to Riley and stormed down the Heat’s inflamed bench, yelling: “Remember all that. Remember what they do.” “They,” of course, being the team coached by his kid brother. “What Riley taught his players was to compete with an intent to dominate and annihilate your competition, mentally and physically,” Alonzo Mourning said. “When he coached the Knicks, he planted that seed. Then he coached the Heat and he planted that same seed. He literally built two monsters.” “Mirror images,” Ewing said. Yet somehow, against all odds of tribal conflict, the Ewing-Mourning friendship was never shaken, much less severed. Not even when Ewing was suspended for a crucial playoff game between the two teams in 1997 after wandering harmlessly off the bench during a brawl under the basket, costing the Knicks a chance to play in the Eastern Conference finals. And not after a slugfest broke out between Mourning and Larry Johnson, a former teammate in Charlotte, in the waning seconds of Game 4 of a first-round series between the Knicks and the Heat in 1998. That resulted in a Mourning suspension, his absence from a Knicks’ Game 5 rout in Miami and a hilarious photo of Jeff Van Gundy almost levitating while clasping Mourning’s leg. Image One of the most memorable images from the Knicks-Heat rivalry: Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, bottom, clinging to Alonzo Mourning’s leg during a fight in the 1998 playoffs.CreditMark Lennihan/Associated Press Count Van Gundy among those who miss such pugnacity. “It’s not an us-versus-them mentality as much,” he told ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski recently. “You’re hard-pressed to find a true rivalry anymore where there’s a little bit of edginess or bad blood.” Paradoxically, Ewing and Mourning, following the lead of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, set a precedent for contemporary stars with their repudiation of Riley’s no-frenemies policy. “Pat used to get mad when he was the Knicks’ coach and I’d go out with Alonzo and Dikembe,” Ewing said, tossing in Mutombo, another Georgetown veteran. “He’d tell me, ‘You got to stay away from those guys.’ But whenever we played, starting with the summer workouts at Georgetown, we’d try to kill each other.” Alonzo Mourning said, “And at the end of the day, it was family,” Trey Mourning, a toddler back then, has one notable memory of the Heat-Knicks rivalry, the aftermath of the Porter-Sprewell episode in 1999, otherwise known as the Allan Houston game. Houston’s climactic runner in the lane bounced on the rim before going through the net, breaking Miami’s heart and propelling the Knicks from the threshold of first-round defeat all the way to the N.B.A. finals. “We had a TV in the kitchen — my Nana was there, my two cousins,” Trey said. “I couldn’t comprehend what it all meant yet, but I do remember they showed my dad walking off the court like this.” He put both hands on his head and feigned a look of disbelief. “That game hurt him,” he said. “He still talks about it sometimes.” As Georgetown does not retire jersey numbers, Trey wears his father’s and Ewing’s No. 33. He sat down for a recent interview in a National Kidney Foundation T-shirt, reflecting his father’s work to combat the rare disease — focal glomerulosclerosis — that threatened his life and required the transplant at age 32. Image Ewing and Mourning in 2003, when the Knicks retired Ewing’s number.CreditBarton Silverman/The New York Times As a young teenager, Trey developed a passion for international soccer and asked his father if he could go to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil as a high school graduation present. “I told him I would try to make it happen, and then he went out and learned to speak Portuguese,” Alonzo said. “What 15-year-old does that?” They never made it to Brazil, summer enrollment at Georgetown intervening, but that was the beginning of Trey Mourning’s love affair with language. He has since learned Italian, Spanish, some Greek and French, and hopes to make use of his lingual skills while playing professionally in Europe. “Trey’s been a vocal leader for us,” said Ewing, whose Hoyas start two freshman guards. “He didn’t play much before this season, so he doesn’t have a lot of experience. But he’s grown up with the game; he always wants to learn.” When he finished answering questions in the interview, Trey had a few of his own for a reporter he knew had covered the careers of his father, his coach and that Jordan fellow who always got the better of the Georgetown alumni. “What made Michael so good, in your opinion?” he said, turning on his smartphone recorder. The answer was simple. In addition to his otherworldly skills, Jordan had the same will and work ethic that defined Riley’s teams in Miami and New York. Effort, Trey Mourning was told, can never be legislated out of the game. He nodded. It was nothing he hadn’t heard from his father and his “uncle”-turned-coach, the root of everything they embrace, including each other.

sport Can Cuba Baseball Still Be Great When Many of Its Stars Have Left? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Baseball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Baseball|Can Cuba Baseball Still Be Great When Many of Its Stars Have Left? Supported by Can Cuba Baseball Still Be Great When Many of Its Stars Have Left? Image Cuba’s baseball team stood for the nation’s anthem before an exhibition game against the Tampa Bay Rays in Havana in March 2016.CreditCreditNoah Friedman-Rudovsky By Ed Augustin Dec. 28, 2018 BAYAMO, Cuba — The Sancti Spíritus Roosters will face the Villa Clara Orangemen and the Ciego de Ávila Tigers will meet the Las Tunas Woodcutters as the Cuban National Series playoffs begin on Jan. 4. But none of Cuba’s best baseball players will be on the diamond. “All the stars have gone,” said Mario Ojeda, 79, a fan and former catcher in the league. “How has baseball changed over the last decade? It’s like night and day.” Cuba is hemorrhaging ballplayers: Over the last three years, more than 300 have left the country, some after arduous journeys in the hands of smugglers, most hoping to try their luck in the United States. There are now 25 players on Major League Baseball rosters who were born in Cuba. On a proud island where baseball embodies national identity, this exodus has been a painful blow. “It’s contradictory,” said Ismael Sené, a Cuban baseball historian. “We don’t like our players going. But on the other hand, we want them to triumph abroad because they are products of our system.” Top ballplayers have dribbled out since the Cuban Revolution ended in 1959 (and to a lesser extent, before then). Yet despite receiving multimillion-dollar offers to defect while the national team was on tour, the vast majority of players remained loyal. They were committed to team and country, discouraged by the difficulty of leaving, or feared for their loved ones, who would be left behind indefinitely. Defections, however, began to accelerate a decade ago. Relaxed travel restrictions and the spread of the internet allowed baseball agents to penetrate Cuba like never before. Even Cubans who had left the country but failed to sign in the major leagues could earn a commission by recruiting former teammates through social media. Cuba has relaxed its migration laws: Before 2013, ballplayers’ movements were more strictly controlled, enriching smugglers who siphoned players off the island on cigarette boats for hefty fees. It became easier for an agent to pay for a player to get a passport, fly him to Haiti (where he could establish the third country residence required to sign as a free agent), and have him cross the border to the Dominican Republic, where he could train and demonstrate his skills in M.L.B. academies. The current major leaguers Yuli and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. walked out on the national team in 2016 as it played in the Dominican Republic; Víctor Víctor Mesa, Víctor Mesa Jr. and Lionard Kindelán, among the last prospects on the island, flew away last spring. Image Víctor Mesa Jr., left, and his older brother, Víctor Víctor Mesa, who played for Cuba at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, left Cuba last spring and are now members of the Miami Marlins’ organization.CreditNoah Friedman-Rudovsky All are children of Cuban baseball royalty who won Olympic gold in 1996. Their generation’s dream of representing the homeland has largely given way to the dream of playing in the major leagues for American-style paychecks. Cuban ballplayers make $40 a month, slightly more than the average state wage. When they won the National Series last season, the Granma Stallions were rewarded with a week at an all-inclusive resort and rice cookers; as a free agent in November 2016, Yoenis Cespedes, who grew up playing in Granma Province, signed a four-year, $110 million contract with the Mets. Cuba’s baseball federation and Major League Baseball announced an agreement on Dec. 19 to legalize and streamline the transfer of professional baseball players to the United States and Canada in an effort to end the smuggling of athletes and to bring order to the byzantine paths players from the island must take to clubs. The agreement, however, must be approved by the American government because of the longstanding trade embargo against Cuba, and the Trump administration has so far given mixed signals about it. A more systematic recruitment could better regulate the departures of Cuba’s best players, which have left the country’s national team foundering. In July, Cuba came home without a gold medal from the Central American and Caribbean Games for the first time since 1982. Major league games are broadcast in Cuba. Until a few years ago, when Cubans stepped up to the plate, censors edited them out, acknowledging a reality everybody knew was too painful. Though the strongest players have already been gleaned, agents know the Cuban system can still generate quality players, and so have adapted their approach to woo younger players, Cuban baseball officials said. Yovani Aragón, Cuba’s national baseball commissioner, said boys as young as 13 were being lured away to sign as free agents in major and minor leagues in other countries, including South Korea, Panama, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Puerto Rico. This puts them in a better position to eventually sign with Major League Baseball. “Traffickers now make contact with the parents,” he said. “They are taking away not just players but entire families.” Cuba’s response to defectors is uncompromising: Those who leave illegally are, with the rarest exceptions, exiled, barred from returning to the island for eight years. But players who leave legally, such as Las Tunas first baseman Rafael Viñales, whose American dream didn’t work out, can now return to play. And since 2013, Cuba has borrowed from the capitalist playbook, allowing clubs in Japan, Italy, Canada, Panama and Colombia to lease players for a part of the season. Image Members of the Cuban baseball team paraded their flag around the field after defeating Japan at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Cuba won the gold medal. From left: Eduardo Paret, Juan Manrique, Alberto Hernández and Miguel Caldés.CreditAl Behrman/Associated Press Roel Santos, 30, Granma and Cuba’s leadoff hitter, earned $150,000 for playing five months last year in Japan. He said the cash has stopped him from worrying about making ends meet and allowed him to focus more on his game. He has bought a few houses in Cuba but is hardly living the high life — like all other Granma players, he shares a no-frills hotel room with a teammate on game days. Foreign contracts have led to abrupt inequality on the field, but have not stopped the flight: Ciego de Ávila Tigers outfielder Adolis García did not come back after his contract with the Yomiuri Giants expired. Last year, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. “It hurts when a colleague you’ve known for ages decides to go,” Santos said. “Before, people took it more to heart. Now it’s happened so many times, it’s become normal.” Carlos Martí, 69, the manager of the Granma Stallions and Cuba’s national team, said he saw defections as part of a broad plan of imperial sabotage. “They are trying to damage Cuban baseball and, above all, the Cuban system,” he said during a team practice at the Martyrs of Barbados Stadium, which is named after a Cuban fencing team that died in a plane crash in 1976 in which anti-Castro exiles and a former C.I.A. operative from Venezuela have been implicated. Martí, like many Cubans in high-profile positions, blames the American embargo for scant resources. Practice balls are waterproofed with yellow, oil-based paint and used for two months. The third baseman Osvaldo Abreu, 28, has never had his own bat. The consensus among Cuban players, coaches and fans is that the best way to stem the flow is through the deal with the M.L.B. Reaction to the deal from players and fans was euphoric. The agreement would make Cuban players in their mid-20s eligible, in an effort to preserve youth development and play in Cuba. Cuba’s baseball federation would also get a cut of the players’ M.L.B. earnings. “This would create a system that allows Cuba to retain their homegrown talent for an appropriate period of time,” said Dan Halem, M.L.B. chief legal officer. Approval of the agreement can come none too soon for those in Cuban baseball. “We’re at a critical point,” said Aliet Arzola Lima, a sportswriter for Granma, the Communist Party’s official newspaper. “Without a deal, the situation will continue — but it can’t get any worse than it is at the moment.” Correction:  An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the Cuban national team’s opponent for an exhibition game in Havana. It was the Tampa Bay Rays, not the Miami Marlins. It also misstated the year in which the game was played. It was 2016, not 2015. Follow @NYTSports for more sports news.

Warren/Associated Press By The Associated Press Dec. 27, 2018 Sigi Schmid, the winningest coach in Major League Soccer history, died on Dec. 25 in Los Angeles. He was 65. His death, at Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center, came as he was awaiting a heart transplant. He had been hospitalized three weeks earlier. Schmid had a league-record 266 regular-season and postseason victories in 18 seasons with the Los Angeles Galaxy, the Columbus Crew and the Seattle Sounders. He led his teams to two M.L.S. titles, the first with the Galaxy in 2002 and the second with the Crew in 2008. Schmid was twice named M.L.S. coach of the year and was inducted in the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2015. His lifetime regular-season record was 240 wins, 183 losses and 125 ties. In Schmid’s first season as coach of the Crew, the team finished last. “Being able to digest losses on a regular basis in that first year and having to come in and rebuild the spirits and the troops was something in my coaching career I hadn’t really faced very often,” he said. Two years later, the Crew won the league championship. Schmid, who had a history of heart problems, was in the midst of his second stint as coach of the Galaxy when he stepped down in September with six games left in the regular season. Schmid was born in West Germany in 1953 and moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was 4. He coached at U.C.L.A., his alma mater, for 19 seasons before moving to the pros. He led the Bruins to 16 consecutive postseason appearances and three N.C.A.A. titles while compiling a record of 322-63-33. He is survived by his wife, Valerie; three sons, Kurt, Kyle and Eric; a daughter, Lacey Nicholl; and several grandchildren. Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, praised Schmid in a statement as “one of the leading figures in the history of our league.” The New York Times contributed reporting.

sport Doug Baldwin has a message for the rest of the league: “Look out” Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Doug Baldwin has a message for the rest of the league: “Look out” Mike FlorioProFootball Talk on NBC SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 1:48 PM GMT The abrupt end to a season that results from a playoff loss can trigger a wide range of emotions, mostly negative. And while Seahawks receiver Doug Baldwin opened his press availability after Saturday night’s 24-22 loss to the Cowboys by admitting that he’s “sad, confused, frustrated,” the things he eventually said were far more positive, clear, aspirational. “Look out,” Baldwin said regarding the future for the Seahawks. “This team, we have everything we need. You have all the pieces. You have all the right mindsets, personalities, everything. It’s just we’re a young team. With the time comes progression, comes growth, comes learning. This team will be better.” Scroll to continue with content Ad When he says the team will be better, he doesn’t simply mean on the field. “I think the best thing we will do from this point on moving forward is that we will take these lessons and learn from them and grow and be better, not only as football players, but as men,” Baldwin said. “That is vastly more important. Yes, it’s sad the way it ended, but this is not the end of the world. There are some phenomenal individuals in this locker room; phenomenal football players. . . . The future is bright.” The present won’t feel that way, and Baldwin tried to help his younger teammates process that feeling. Story continues “I said a lot of things,” Baldwin said regarding his message in the locker room. “The sentiment of the message was cherish these moments. Learn from it. Don’t let the loss be in vain. If you do the honest reflection in the mirror and you ask yourself the tough questions and seek the right answers, no loss is ever a loss. You still win if you learn. You may not be victorious, but you still win. That message was not just for football, it was for human beings, for the life they live off the field as well. We’re called to be great football players, but more importantly, we’re called to be great men.” It’s a great message from a team that far exceeded what most thought they could do. And Baldwin is right. If they continue to progress, the best advice for the rest of the league will be to look out.

sport Soon to Be Alone in Oakland, the A’s Inch Closer to a New Stadium - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Soon to Be Alone in Oakland, the A’s Inch Closer to a New Stadium Supported by On Baseball Soon to Be Alone in Oakland, the A’s Inch Closer to a New Stadium Image A rendering of the Athletics’ proposed new ballpark at Howard Terminal in Oakland.CreditCreditBIG -Bjarke Ingels Group/Oakland Athletics, via Associated Press By Tyler Kepner Nov. 29, 2018 It all seems so perfect, naturally, in the artist’s rendering of the Oakland Athletics’ proposed new stadium. Fans of all kinds flock to the ballpark by Howard Terminal — young, old, black, white, one in a wheelchair, one walking a dog. The distinctive silver cargo loaders on the bay loom to the left, while a military flyover roars overhead. The marquee declares this the 2023 World Series. That would mark 33 years since the Athletics’ last appearance in the World Series, a stretch that would nearly rival the franchise’s chasm between pennants from 1931 to 1972. Those fruitless decades were eventful, at least, as the franchise migrated from Philadelphia to Kansas City to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, where it has remained. Twenty-two teams have changed ballparks in the last 30 seasons, creating more revenue and a better fan experience than the A’s enjoy in the creaky, charmless facility they share — for now — with the Raiders of the N.F.L. The A’s have spent more than a decade trying to escape — prisoners at Alcatraz had better luck — but this time, they believe they will finally succeed. If they do, they will play in baseball’s first stadium to fit within a grassy, tree-lined public park on the perimeter above it. “Charlie Finley would be happy to know we’re doing that,” A’s president Dave Kaval said on Wednesday, referring to the maverick owner who moved the team to Oakland in 1968. “We have a great history of innovation, actually. We need to play the part.” Image At a news conference Wednesday to announce the team’s stadium plans, A’s president Dave Kaval, center, was seated next to Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, second from right.CreditBen Margot/Associated Press For the Athletics, this week’s ballpark announcement caps one of the more interesting seasons in the majors. On the field, they shook off three last-place finishes by earning a wild-card berth with 97 victories, their most since the “Moneyball” season of 2002. Off the field, they toasted their 50th anniversary in Oakland with a free-admission game in April, and then scrapped traditional season-ticket plans in favor of “A’s Access,” a full-season general-admission pass that starts at just $240. The ballpark would be their most ambitious adventure of all, as long as it does not become more of the same. Since the middle of the last decade, the A’s have proposed building on the existing Coliseum site in East Oakland; in Fremont, Calif.; in San Jose; and at Oakland’s Laney College, a plan that was halted last December by the board of the Peralta Community College District. “We’ve learned a lot, especially from the Peralta episode, about how important community engagement is in Oakland, and getting a sense of what the community wants and the pulse,” said Kaval, adding that the team had held hundreds of one-on-one meetings and hosted dozens of workshops with civic groups. “We think that’s an important differentiator.” The A’s pledge to privately finance the entire project — with the nonspecific price tag of “hundreds of millions,” Kaval said — but do not expect to break ground for at least two years. A legally mandated environmental-impact study will take about a year, with a 270-day window to resolve any possible lawsuits. The A’s also must complete negotiations with the Port of Oakland to control the 55-acre site, and reach a development deal with the city on how to pay for infrastructure changes. Kaval is the former president of Major League Soccer’s San Jose Earthquakes, who privately financed a $100 million stadium in 2015. That experience involved many of the same challenges, he said, which gives him reason for hope. Before Kaval joined the A’s in 2016, the team had spent years trying in vain to move to San Jose, where the Giants hold territorial rights. In the meantime, the other Oakland teams struck deals to move. The Warriors will open a waterfront arena in San Francisco next season, and the Raiders, who are building a stadium in Las Vegas, could leave Oakland as soon as next season. Image For years, the A’s used tarps to cover the upper deck of the Coliseum, which they share — for now — with the Raiders of the N.F.L.CreditBen Margot/Associated Press The Athletics’ plan includes redevelopment of the Coliseum site, which they have offered to buy from the city and county, to preserve Oracle Arena for concerts and other events. The Coliseum itself would be razed, though a baseball field would remain, as it does at the site of the old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The parking lots would turn into residences, offices, retail space and a tech campus. “We feel a great sense of responsibility in being the last professional sports team in Oakland,” Kaval said. “I think there is a groundswell of support around that, from the elected leaders and the populace, everyone in the East Bay, to do whatever we can do to make sure it’s a success.” The A’s are using the term “jewel box” to describe the stadium, which would have around 34,000 seats, essentially the fewest in the game and almost 15,000 fewer than they have at the Coliseum, not including the tarped-off football seats high above the outfield. The A’s wanted a sleek, modern feel — not a 1990s-style throwback — and Kaval is pleased that some members of the Danish design firm, Bjarke Ingels Group, have no knowledge of baseball. “They had people on the team who had never been to a baseball game,” he said. “They approached it almost like an anthropologist would approach ancient Mayans playing a sport, asking all these questions that never get asked.” Besides the leafy walking paths that will ring the top of the venue, the A’s envision other curiosities like a retractable hitters’ backdrop beneath the center-field scoreboard. But with the closest Bay Area Rapid Transit station about a mile away, the team is proposing using aerial gondolas to take fans from downtown to Jack London Square near the stadium. Bringing it all to life, as always, will be the hard part. Kaval is convinced there are treasures in that jewel box of dreams. “Our team already does amazing work with what they have,” he said. “It’s exciting to think of what that new version of the future could be.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: If It’s Built, New A’s Park Will Be Something Different.

sport The Mets’ New G.M. Prefers Boldness to Bargains. Now Comes His Big Chance. - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|The Mets’ New G.M. Prefers Boldness to Bargains. Now Comes His Big Chance. Supported by On Baseball The Mets’ New G.M. Prefers Boldness to Bargains. Now Comes His Big Chance. Image At last year’s winter meetings, Brodie Van Wagenen was an agent. This year, he is the Mets’ general manager.CreditCreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times By Tyler Kepner Dec. 7, 2018 Just hours after Brodie Van Wagenen introduced his first acquisitions as the Mets’ general manager, his spotlight went out. A division rival stole it with a bold outlay of free-agent cash. The Mets had welcomed second baseman Robinson Cano and closer Edwin Diaz to Citi Field on Tuesday after a seven-player trade with Seattle. But then the Washington Nationals struck, agreeing with the All-Star left-hander Patrick Corbin on the first nine-figure deal — six years, $140 million — of the current free-agent market. It was the kind of contract Van Wagenen craved in his former job as an agent, uniting a player with a contender at a price too rich for even the Yankees. As Van Wagenen heads to Las Vegas for the winter meetings, which begin on Sunday, he finds himself in a role reversal: instead of asking for free-agent contracts, he will be trying to give them. Ownership provides his budget, of course, but Van Wagenen is now in position to live up to his strong words that jolted the industry last February. Back then, as owners shrugged at a lackluster free-agent market for the 2018 season, Van Wagenen posted an angry Twitter missive. He was still an agent at that point and he warned that a “fight is brewing” over a market that “feels coordinated, rightly or wrongly.” Van Wagenen even threatened that a “boycott of spring training may be a starting point if behavior does not start to change,” a possibility the players union refuted two days later. That post is deleted now, and Van Wagenen spoke with Commissioner Rob Manfred last month, smoothing over any hard feelings about the collusion charge. But while his new contemporaries — a young, analytically savvy group of general managers — have concluded that it is folly to lavish splashy contracts on players past their primes, Van Wagenen is not so sure. “Everybody’s model and opinion on what future value is should vary and differ, and I hope ours is unique, because if it’s not, then we’re all chasing the same game plan,” he said. “I certainly didn’t take this job to follow the lead of others.” With this winter’s free-agent market just starting to stir, we do not yet know how the Mets fit into it under Van Wagenen. Three of his lieutenants — Ruben Amaro Jr., Allard Baird and Omar Minaya — were general managers in the previous decade, when teams more eagerly invested in players over 30. Cano was not a free agent when the Mets obtained him, but he is 36 years old, is signed through 2023 and the Mets took on more than $60 million over all in the trade. As an agent, Van Wagenen negotiated Cano’s 10-year, $240 million deal with the Mariners in 2013 and in this trade sent Seattle two regrettable contracts the Mets agreed to last winter, with Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak. Those were just a few of the deals that supported the reluctance of most teams to spend a lot of money. In the weeks after Van Wagenen spoke out last winter, the free-agent market did finally pick up. Eric Hosmer got $144 million from the San Diego Padres, Yu Darvish $126 million from the Chicago Cubs, Jake Arrieta $75 million from the Philadelphia Phillies, Alex Cobb $57 million from the Baltimore Orioles, and so on. All four then underperformed in 2018, as did many others who signed late. Van Wagenen attributed it to timing. Image Van Wagenen, left, with the newly acquired Robinson Cano. Van Wagenen was previously Cano’s agent.CreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times “I don’t think it’s ever a good thing to force a player into a circumstance where he can’t be successful,” he said. “And when you sign players late in the process and they don’t have a full spring training — or they don’t have the opportunity to have a clear idea of what their role and expectations are going to be with a new team — that hurts the individual, it hurts the teammates that player will join, and it certainly hurts the organization. My plan is not to bargain-shop in February and March. My plan is to be aggressive and strategic in filling our needs as soon as possible.” Baird, a former Kansas City Royals general manager, worked for the Boston Red Sox last season and saw the impact of an exception to the free-agent flops. J.D. Martinez signed in late February (five years, $110 million) and hit .330 with 43 homers. He helped lead the Red Sox to the World Series, where David Price — who signed for seven years and $217 million with Boston in December 2015 — won the clincher. Do the 2018 Red Sox, then, prove that aggressive free-agent spending may be a worthwhile gamble after all? Baird would not go that far. “We can look at the other ones that didn’t turn out; we can surely look at that as well,” he said. “But I also learned in Boston that the culture has a huge impact on those players — the supporting cast, the resources that are around that individual during the bumps and the grind. So the infrastructure that you put those guys into is a really, really important element.” The Mets’ intangibles will reveal themselves over time, but Amaro — a former Phillies general manager who returns to the front office after serving as the Mets’ first-base coach — said Van Wagenen was off to an encouraging start. He noted that, at the news conference for Cano and Diaz, Van Wagenen thanked numerous Mets staffers, including the scouts who signed the prospects the Mets had just traded. The Mets do seem united in their goal of contending immediately. That belief, and the vision to execute it, helped Van Wagenen get the job. “That was all part of the analysis when we looked at the different G.M. candidates, as far as what they thought,” said Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer. “Some thought teardown, some didn’t think that we had enough. But Brodie being aggressive and knowing the landscape of New York and being comfortable here, he doesn’t seem like a rookie G.M. right now in terms of the way he’s acting. He wants to show this fan base that we can win and we can win now.” The trick is where Van Wagenen goes from here, and how much Wilpon will give him to spend. The free-agent market teems with options, and seems to be an easier way to plug holes than through trades. The Mets already dealt three prospects to Seattle, and would rather keep the position players most appealing to other teams, like Michael Conforto, Brandon Nimmo and Amed Rosario. Could they sign a catcher like Yasmani Grandal, Jonathan Lucroy, Wilson Ramos or Martin Maldonado? What about an outfielder like A.J. Pollock, Andrew McCutchen or Adam Jones? How about a reliever — Adam Ottavino, Andrew Miller, David Robertson — to set up for Diaz? (And there’s always the fantasy of Manny Machado or Bryce Harper …) So here is Van Wagenen’s chance. If the industry really does undervalue free agents, as he asserted just 10 months ago, why not sign some and test out the theory? The Mets are not tanking, and for that they should be applauded. But their chosen path, and their market, demand that they invest heavily in available talent. “The national sports landscape is better when the New York teams are successful — and that is for the Yankees, that’s for the Mets, that’s for the Knicks, the Nets, everybody in town,” Van Wagenen said. “I think that we are all better off, and sports is more compelling, if the New York teams are relevant. I want to be relevant, I hope the Yankees continue to be relevant, and I think the Mets owe it to this city and this fan base to try to win every year.” Related Coverage ‘We Came Here to Win’: Mets Unveil Cano and DiazDec. 4, 2018 Image Nationals’ Signing of Patrick Corbin Proves Yankees Can Be OutbidDec. 4, 2018 Image At Heart of Mets’ Trade for Robinson Cano, a Bold Bid on NowDec. 3, 2018 Image M.L.B.

sport Bryson DeChambeau not a fan of new drop rule: "A bit absurd, unfortunately" Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Bryson DeChambeau not a fan of new drop rule: "A bit absurd, unfortunately" Joel BeallGolf DigestJanuary 5, 2019, 5:31 PM GMT Bryson DeChambeau not a fan of new drop rule: "A bit absurd, unfortunately"Bryson DeChambeau doesn't like golf's new drop rule. “That you have to drop it from knee height is a bit absurd, unfortunately,” he said. Bryson DeChambeau's putting experiment is garnering news in Kapalua this week, as the 25-year-old has been the most prominent player to endorse a new rule that allows the flagstick to remain in at all times. However, it's another rules revision that caught DeChambeau's attention on Friday. Following a five-under round of 68 at the Tournament of Champions, a score that left him in second place heading into the weekend, DeChambeau was candid in his thoughts about the change in taking a drop. Under the latest iteration to the Rules of Golf, a player must release a ball from knee height. To DeChambeau, a stipulation that doesn't make sense. Scroll to continue with content Ad “That you have to drop it from knee height is a bit absurd, unfortunately,” DeChambeau said. “I think that you should be able to go from knee height to shoulder height. There should be no issue with that, whatever you want to do, honestly." RELATED:What you need to know about the new Rules of Golf DeChambeau also remarked on a decision that allows players to repair damage on putting surfaces. Specifically, how he finds it amusing that players can now fix spike marks. "Because I can see a lot of guys, when nobody's really looking, tapping down some things and making a little depression so they can putt it through that area a little bit better," DeChambeau said. As for an update on his trials with the flat stick and flagstick—players can now putt with the pin in—heavy winds caused DeChambeau to pull the flag more than Day 1, yet he remains steadfast in the benefits of keeping the pin where it stands. "I think the flagstick's always interesting. I'm using it to my advantage, best I can," Dechambeau asserted. Story continues So far, it's working: DeChambeau has posted a 7.035 strokes gained/putting figure through two days, best in the TOC field. He will begin Round 3 three strokes behind Gary Woodland.

The Nets picked the most unlikely way to end their skid, stopping a 12-game slide against Toronto with their first victory over the Raptors since April 3, 2015. Jarrett Allen made the go-ahead basket for the Nets with a little more than a minute left, their only basket in overtime not made by Russell. Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points for the Raptors, but Toronto couldn’t get a look for him on its final possession and had to settle for Fred VanVleet’s 3-pointer that just missed. The Nets led by 7 with under five minutes remaining in regulation, but Leonard fed VanVleet for a 3-pointer and then scored the next 6 points himself to give Toronto a 96-94 edge with 2 minutes 23 seconds to play. But his shot from in the lane rattled out with seven seconds to play, and he blocked Dinwiddie’s shot on the other end to force overtime. Russell had the first two baskets in the extra session, Leonard made the next two, and the Nets eventually pulled out a close game, after they had fallen three times by 2 points during their losing streak.

sport Lexi Thompson enjoys another week playing against the guys, outdriving Charley Hoffman and getting Tiger Woods' attention Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Lexi Thompson enjoys another week playing against the guys, outdriving Charley Hoffman and getting Tiger Woods' attention Ryan HerringtonGolf DigestDecember 9, 2018, 9:07 PM GMT Officially, the duo of Lexi Thompson and Tony Finau finished seventh in the 12-team field at the QBE Shootout on Sunday. Unofficially, the pairing won the week at Tiburón Golf Club in Naples, Fla., at least judging by the buzz they created. Or should we say the buzz that Thompson, the lone female in the field, drew with her power game. “She hits the ball incredibly, and she made a lot of putts, which took a lot of pressure off me,” said Finau on Friday after the first round, when the pair posted a 11-under 61 in a scramble format to sit two strokes off the lead. Scroll to continue with content Ad Thompson and Finau played with Harold Varner III and Bubba Watson, who were also wowed by Thompson’s game. Specifically her length off the tee. “She hammered it off the first hole, he goes, ‘Oh gosh.’ ” Watson said of Varner’s reaction. He continued to throw his partner under the bus talk about Varner’s surprise at Thompson’s play. “No. 9, she hit a good one on 9. You were like, ‘Oh my gosh, she outdrove me.’ ” “I mean, I’m surprised she didn’t,” Varner said. “She hits it really well.” Thompson’s ability to keep up with Varner didn’t go unnoticed by those watching the competition from afar. According to Watson, he and Varner received a text from “the Presidents Cup captain”—that would be Tiger Woods—that asked: “How many times did Lexi outdrive Harold?” “What a nice guy,” Varner said tongue in cheek. Story continues Varner insisted that Thompson never actually did outdrive him (he averaged more than 308 yards off the tee in 2018, 18th on the PGA Tour), but on Saturday, Charley Hoffman was caught red-handed. He and Gary Woodland were playing with Thompson and Finau in a modified alternate-shot format. For most of the day, Hoffman’s drives went 10-15 yards past Thompson’s. But on the 18th hole, Hoffman was walking down the fairway and walked past a ball he assumed was Thompson’s, but was actually his. Finau saw this and couldn’t help but poke fun at Hoffman asking him what he was doing. “Charley just walks past Lexi’s ball as if, ‘Hey, I already know I outdrove her.’ ” Finau said. “I kind of yell at him, ‘Charley, do you want me to pick your ball up?’ I was standing by Lexi’s ball, and he starts rushing his ball. He looks back and just starts shaking his head. That was quite a funny exchange.” This is Thompson’s third year playing in the two-person team event, and she was appreciative of getting the chance to compete with the PGA Tour pros once again. “It’s a huge honor,” Thompson said on Sunday. “It’s a great event. I grew up with two older brothers and playing with the guys, it’s pretty remarkable … just watching their games and the shots they can hit. And playing with Tony, he hits it forever off the tee and so straight. So I was just kind of learning out there. playing my own game but just learning.

sport Mike Tomlin Does Damage Control After Antonio Brown’s Absence - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Mike Tomlin Does Damage Control After Antonio Brown’s Absence Supported by Mike Tomlin Does Damage Control After Antonio Brown’s Absence Image Coach Mike Tomlin and Antonio Brown have had a productive relationship on the field. Off the field, they have sometimes had issues.CreditCreditJoe Sargent/Getty Images By Benjamin Hoffman Jan. 2, 2019 “Obviously this is not our usual business.” With that, Coach Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers opened a season-ending news conference on Wednesday in which he addressed his team’s late-season collapse and the drama surrounding the superstar receiver Antonio Brown, all the while struggling to mask his discomfort. “Extremely disappointed,” Tomlin said in summation of the season. “I think that’s a succinct assessment of it. The fact that we’re actually standing in this room says it all.” The Steelers’ roller coaster of a season began with a 1-2-1 stretch, followed by a six-game winning streak that seemed to quell the early-season consternation, and then a collapse that dragged the team out of the playoff picture. But things hit a new low early this week when it became clear that Brown had missed Sunday’s win over Cincinnati not because of a knee injury, as the team had said, but rather for disciplinary reasons. [Read: The Ravens and the Eagles claw their way to the N.F.L. playoffs] Complicating matters was Brown’s use of social media this week, in which he seemed to be courting attention from the San Francisco 49ers: He followed the team’s Instagram account, posted an Instagram story about Jerry Rice being the greatest wide receiver of all time, and replied to a Twitter post by San Francisco’s George Kittle. But Tomlin, closing out his 12th season with Pittsburgh, kept trying to bring the focus back to the team, insisting that no decisions had been made, that no disciplinary actions had been taken, and that Brown, regardless of his social media chatter, had not requested a trade. “Distractions and things of that nature are part of the job, particularly in today’s N.F.L.,” Tomlin said. “I don’t run away from it; in fact, I embrace it.” The Steelers have had no shortage of distractions in recent years, from the suspensions and contract holdouts of Le’Veon Bell — the superstar running back who sat out the entire 2018 season in hopes of negotiating a larger contract — to Brown’s occasional public disagreements with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, to the team’s bizarre national anthem protest last season in which no one seemed to be on the same page. Tomlin tried to explain the timeline around Brown’s absence on Sunday as clearly as possible. He said Brown sat out of the team’s practices last week with what was described as a sore knee, then was told on Friday to get an magnetic resonance imaging exam — a test Tomlin says was never performed. After Brown failed to communicate with the team on Friday night, Tomlin said, the Steelers made plans to face the Bengals without him. Tomlin said Brown’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, reached out Sunday in hopes of getting Brown onto the field, but Tomlin, who agreed to meet with Brown, said that “playing wasn’t on the menu” at that point. When asked if it was the injury or a disciplinary action that kept Brown out on Sunday, Tomlin said, “He was absent due to injury and lack of information.” Now the team must decide what to do with a 30-year-old wide receiver who is clearly still in his prime but who appears to be at something of an impasse with his coach. Tomlin was asked about Brown’s social media usage, and he tried to make light of how much the news media likes to make a big deal of something that is not important to him. But Brown seemed to tweak his coach by posting a message to Twitter during the news conference that could be seen as a response to Tomlin’s comments. Brown was still at the top of his game for Pittsburgh this season. He exceeded 100 receptions for an N.F.L.-record sixth consecutive season, and while he finished behind his teammate JuJu Smith-Schuster in catches and receiving yards — the first season he has not led the Steelers in both categories since 2012 — he scored a career-high 15 touchdowns. But in a rare acknowledgment that distractions can sometimes get out of control, Tomlin said Brown’s situation could “certainly” get to the point where the receiver was more problematic than useful. The issues with trading Brown are plentiful. There is the cap hit the team would take for moving him (a blow that would be softened by savings in future years), the question of how much value a team could get for an aging wide receiver, and the prospect of going into 2019 with neither Bell nor Brown. But Tomlin said his team would “waddle in it right now,” letting this season’s failure sink in before making any decisions about next season. And while he intimated that it would be fair to say that Brown quit on the team, Tomlin said he was doing his best to keep some emotional distance from the issue. “There’s disappointment, there’s no denying that,” Tomlin said. “On a personal level, man, I’ve just learned over the course of time, forget my personal feelings.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Distracted Steelers Could Shed Some Stars.

sport Athletes Who Changed the Game in 2018 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Athletes Who Changed the Game in 2018 Supported by Athletes Who Changed the Game in 2018 Beyond spectacular achievement, these athletes managed to alter how others viewed or played their sports. By The New York Times Sports Staff Dec. 28, 2018 This is a short list. Hundreds of athletes are truly spectacular at their sport and routinely blow our minds with feats of skill. But our goal this year was to highlight the very few who, through innovation, vision or just plain courage, actually changed how others in their sport viewed or played the game. We have probably missed somebody, so please let us know who you think should be on this list and why. Send your thoughts to sportsnyt@gmail.com. We look forward to hearing from you. Football Patrick Mahomes: The Highlight Reel Image CreditEd Zurga/Associated Press By Ben Shpigel On the second Monday in October, I walked down the basement steps of a house in Kansas City, Mo., to find Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes staring at me. Not the corporeal version but rather his likeness in two dimensions, painted on a wall in Bob Green’s home that is reserved for Kansas City sporting luminaries. Green asked an artist friend to add Mahomes to the mural in mid-September. It was three starts into Mahomes’s career. “I assume he will make the Hall of Fame, you know,” Green said. Mahomes, at 23, is the best player on the best offense on the top-seeded team in the A.F.C., in a season in which teams are on pace to score the second-most points in N.F.L. history. He threw for the second-most yards in the league this season, 5,097, and the most touchdowns, 50, since 2013, when Peyton Manning set the single-season record with 55. Mobile, strong-armed and touched with a remarkable capacity for completing throws others wouldn’t dare attempt, Mahomes does not represent the new prototype for the position so much as the ideal for how football is played in 2018 and perhaps beyond: directing a creative scheme rooted in college spread concepts with devastating efficiency. His game film is crammed with highlights demonstrating an aptitude for improvising in the truest sense of the word. He employs his awareness and feel to create something new, different, better. Magic Johnson did it. Steph Curry does it. It’s what sublime athletes do. Mahomes is operating within the same confines that have governed football for decades — a 100-yard field, surrounded by 21 other players — but playing quarterback in a way that seems purely individualistic. His no-look throws, his sidearm flips, his left-handed flicks — they all, at least to me, evoke the premise of “Chopped,” the reality show on the Food Network, in which contestants are given baskets of mystery ingredients and must prepare meals. Instead of, say, merging kohlrabi, baby octopus, black plums and animal crackers to create a sumptuous dinner, Mahomes processes all that is around him and of him — pass rushers, decaying protection, his own body positioning — and just reacts. “He shows no fear,” the ESPN analyst Louis Riddick said in a recent interview. “That plays into our society right now. Be your own guy. Be an individual. Take risks, take chances — that’s him. But he doesn’t do it in a way that seems reckless. He just seems to do it in a way that, really, his teammates want him to do it, and it makes them better.” The Chiefs, to a degree, anticipated all of this when they traded up to draft Mahomes in 2017. After sitting him for most of last season, the Chiefs unleashed Mahomes against the poor Chargers in Week 1. He threw for four touchdowns in a game that, with the benefit of hindsight, doesn’t even rank among his best. He flummoxed the Steelers in Pittsburgh with six touchdowns. Facing a 10-point deficit in Denver with less than 7 minutes left, he orchestrated two late scoring drives. In a loss, he dinged the Rams for 478 yards and six touchdowns. More recently, in Week 14, Mahomes deflated the Ravens with a pass that analysis does no justice. It was fourth-and-9 at the Chiefs’ 40-yard line, 89 seconds remaining, with Kansas City trailing by 7. Flushed out of the pocket, Mahomes sprinted right, then a bit upfield while being trailed by two defenders. Near the sideline, he released a throw across his body that traveled, according to the N.F.L.’s Next Gen Stats, 43.6 yards in the air. The ball eluded two Ravens defenders and another converging on Tyreek Hill before nestling in his arms at the far hash mark, by Baltimore’s 28-yard line. On the CBS broadcast, Tony Romo about yelped. Success breeds success, but it also breeds imitation. Desultory teams want The Next Mahomes, but what if there isn’t one? That’s not hyperbole, just reasonable conjecture. In 2018, Mahomes is an outlier in a league hustling to adapt to him. And he’s here to stay. The painting is on the wall. SNOWBOARDING Chloe Kim: The Trailblazer Image CreditMargaret Cheatham Williams/The New York Times By John Branch The tweet came in the middle of the gold medal competition, a podium-worthy trick in itself. Chloe Kim, then 17 and considered the best female halfpipe snowboarder by those who pay attention to such things, was about to become a global star. “Wish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to and now I’m getting hangry,” she typed, then sent. Not a deep thought, but a relatable one; news of her pangs zipped silently through the crisp, mountain air to her then-15,000 Twitter followers, a modest number for a teenager who is the best in the world at something as cool as snowboarding. Kim then made serious noise by stomping the competition. She twisted and flipped and smiled her way to the bottom, upending and resetting the standard for her event, landing at the top of the sports world. By the end of that sunny February day at the Pyeongchang Olympics, Kim had a gold medal, 150,000 Twitter followers and the type of crossover appeal that makes fans swoon and marketers salivate. The Olympics usually make comets out of their best athletes, not stars. They are flares that burn out of sight quickly or, with luck and momentum, circle around and attract our attention every four years. Kim is different. Fueled by her breakout performance, a day plus a lifetime in the making, she shows no sign of fading from sight. In July, she was awarded the ESPY for best female athlete. Earlier this month, in Copper Mountain, Colo., she won the season’s first World Cup competition as emphatically as she won at the Winter Games. Then she did it again the next weekend at a major event in nearby Breckenridge. Back in February, amid the hunger-game tweeting at the Olympic finals, Kim scored 93.75 points out of 100 on the first of her three runs. No one else in the competition approached the mark. When it came time for her last run, with all other gold medal hopefuls vanquished, she let loose to “one-up myself,” she said. The run scored 98.25 and featured back-to-back 1080s, far more punctuation than she ever puts in a tweet. Kim was the first woman to pair three 360-degree spins off one wall, then the other, back in 2016. And the only one, at the 2018 Olympics, with the nerve to try it and the talent to do it. She is a paradigm buster in a sport with few rules. A cross between Kelly Clark, the most-dominant female halfpipe rider for most of 20 years, and Shaun White, the charismatic crossover celebrity who found the halfpipe to be a launch point for fame and fortune. Kim grew up watching, and competing against, the pioneers of the sport — people like Clark, Gretchen Bleiler and Torah Bright. She was raised on the cool conscience of the sport, but it became clear quite early that she was a rare talent. She would have made the Olympics in 2014, and been a favorite to win, when she was 13, but she was three years too young to qualify. Now 18, she is an insider with outsized talent. She is compact — 5 feet 2 inches and 115 pounds, a bit like a gymnast or a sprinter or any other athlete that blends power and speed. She has style, snowboarding’s term for riding with understated flair and cool ease. But she flies higher than other women, twists more and comes up biggest in the biggest contests. And she has the guts to tweet about hunger pains while doing it. Kim is the Californian daughter of Korean immigrants. Her father, Jong Jin Kim, came from South Korea in 1982 with $800 and a Korean-English dictionary. He worked at fast-food restaurants and liquor stores, took some college classes and became an engineer. Chloe was born in 2000, a child of a new century. Her father put her on a snowboard at age 4, and they learned how to ride together. People saw her potential every step of the way. She turned 11 in 2011, when the 2018 Winter Olympics were awarded to South Korea. Her father did the math. Perfect. That’s why the bottom of the Olympics halfpipe was a perfect mash of person and place. As Kim navigated the crowd to find her family, her eyes filled with tears. So did her father's. So did a lot of people’s. Just a bit earlier, at the time that Chloe Kim was tweeting about her breakfast sandwich from the top of the halfpipe, her father stood at the bottom in nervous anticipation. He held a crinkled, handwritten sign. Next to a big red heart, it read, “Go Chloe!” She’s going. BASEBALL Ryne Stanek: The Opener Image CreditMike Carlson/Getty Images By Tyler Kepner The Tampa Bay Rays turned the pitcher’s mound into a laboratory in 2018. They had spent much of last winter trading expensive veterans, and their wealthy division rivals in Boston and the Bronx seemed destined to dominate the American League. Why not blow up tradition and see what happened? “So many people tried to destroy us for doing it, which was kind of funny,” pitcher Ryne Stanek said this month in the bustling lobby of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, where he was attending baseball’s winter meetings. “A lot of fans just didn’t understand the logic behind it.” Now they do. The Rays astonished the industry by surging to 90 victories, helped largely by “the opener,” a position they created in which the first pitcher of the game works only an inning or two. Before May 19 — when they unveiled the plan with the veteran reliever Sergio Romo — the Rays ranked 22nd in the majors in earned run average, at 4.43. From then on, they ranked third, at 3.50. Stanek made 29 starts yet pitched only 40 innings in those games. At one point he set a major league record with nine consecutive scoreless starts, though he pitched just 13⅔ innings in that span. The former All-Star Orel Hershiser — who shared the previous record, with six — says the game itself has not changed, but game theory has changed quite a bit. Stanek, whose unusual rookie season symbolized that, wholeheartedly agrees. “It’s about: How can you use your good players better to win more games?” Stanek said. “Every player, you just want to win games, and whatever way we can do that, that’s what we want to do.” Before the season, the Rays had planned to build a bullpen day into their rotation, with several pitchers sharing the load once every five games. They began the year with four traditional starters, and one of them, Blake Snell, would go 21-5 and win the A.L. Cy Young Award. But when injuries and trades depleted the other reliable options, the Rays dove into data for something different. Teams score more runs in the first inning than in any other inning, largely because they stack their best hitters at the top. The Rays tried to counteract that by starting a pitcher with dominant stuff, then using another — the “bulk guy,” they called it — for multiple innings. That bulk guy was typically young and could benefit from facing easier hitters at the start of his longer outing, and the opener would be fresh enough to do it again the next day, if needed. “When I first heard it, I was like, ‘There’s no way that’s sustainable,’” Stanek said. “But then you start looking at the way the innings break down, and you’re like, ‘It doesn’t really change anything. If you’re going to have your starter go five, and I would throw the sixth, why does it matter if I throw the first and he throws the next five innings to get it through the sixth regardless?’” Stanek, 27, was a starter at the University of Arkansas and in the minors. He liked to approach hitters with his best stuff right away; no conserving for later innings, a mind-set ideally suited to shorter stints. His fastball reached 100 miles an hour in his first try as the opener, on May 26, and he struck out 53 in those 40 innings, with a 3.38 earned run average in the role. From his first start through the end of the season, Stanek made five more starts than any other pitcher in the majors. He wonders how truly bizarre his stat line would seem if he had gotten going earlier. “I had times when I started three times in a week,” Stanek said. “I’m like, ‘I could have gotten 50, maybe.’” No pitcher has made 50 starts since 1904, when the Yankees’ Jack Chesbro made 51 while throwing more than 400 innings. Those days are long gone. With so many strong arms available in relief — and stats showing a decrease in pitchers’ effectiveness the more times hitters face them — only 13 pitchers worked 200 innings in 2018, the fewest ever in a full season. The opener idea is not going away. The Oakland Athletics and the Milwaukee Brewers used it in the playoffs. The Minnesota Twins and the Toronto Blue Jays hired managers from the Tampa Bay coaching staff. Stanek and the Rays have started — well, opened — a very logical trend. “If it gives you a chance to win more games than you lose,” Stanek said, “there’s no reason why people wouldn’t do it.” GYMNASTICS Rachael Denhollander: The Hero Image CreditJeff Kowalsky/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Juliet Macur Do you know who stopped Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, the former United States gymnastics national team doctor who is now infamous as the face of sexual assault in sports? Not U.S.A. Gymnastics. Not Michigan State, where Nassar saw patients at a clinic and molested them for decades under the guise of medical treatment. Not even the F.B.I., which in the summer of 2015 learned of the accusations against Nassar and proceeded to plod along in an investigation — if it can be described as that, considering it didn’t contact the main witness for nearly 11 months. So many people or entities had the chance to stop Nassar from hurting girls and women. But credit Rachael Denhollander, a former club gymnast turned lawyer, for finally making it happen and for subsequently making Olympic sports safer. Denhollander, 33, was the first person to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual assault. Her powerful voice sparked real institutional action against him and has saved lives. Without her, it is possible that U.S.A. Gymnastics would still be actively working to bury sexual misconduct accusations against its coaches. And it is likely Congress would not be demanding change in how the United States Olympic Committee and Olympic sports’ national governing bodies deal with sexual misconduct cases. For years, in many Olympic sports, misconduct cases languished within the sports organizations that inexplicably did not automatically report all cases to law enforcement. Now, because of the Nassar case, it’s a federal crime to fail to report sexual assault in Olympic sports. Without Denhollander, it is also possible that the hundreds of young girls and women Nassar molested over the years would still be suffering in silence. “You made this happen,” Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Denhollander in January at one of Nassar’s sentencing hearings, where Denhollander was the 156th, and final, one of Nassar’s victims to provide a witness statement. “You are the bravest person I’ve ever had in my courtroom.” In the summer of 2016, Denhollander read an Indianapolis Star story detailing how U.S.A. Gymnastics, for years, had mishandled sexual assault reports. It was her cue to finally come forward with her painful secret. “It wasn’t something I wanted to do because of the fear and the risk behind it, but it was something I knew I had to do,” she told The New York Times in February. “I didn’t want Larry Nassar to hurt one more child. I felt a responsibility to at least try to stop him.” Denhollander contacted the Indianapolis Star and said Nassar had molested her when she was 15. The newspaper published her story in September 2016, when Nassar was still working at Michigan State. He had been let go from U.S.A. Gymnastics more than a year earlier. She also filed a complaint against Nassar with the Michigan State police and a Title IX complaint with the university. Michigan State relieved Nassar of his clinical duties a day after Denhollander filed her police complaint. About a week after her story ran in the Indianapolis Star, Michigan State fired him. By the end of 2016, Nassar was in jail on federal child pornography charges. Since then, Michigan State has settled with Nassar’s victims — more than 300 of them and counting — for $500 million. U.S.A. Gymnastics has entirely new leadership, and it, along with the U.S.O.C., is instituting reforms to keep athletes safer. Congress, the Indiana attorney general’s office, the Justice Department and other entities are trying to figure out who enabled Nassar and his crimes and attempting to make them accountable. Nassar is in prison, serving a 40-to-175-year sentence for a multitude of sex crimes. At his sentencing hearing in January, Denhollander faced her molester. The judge described her as “a five-star general” of an army of abuse survivors. The public remained rapt as Denhollander spoke and asked the court, again and again, “How much is a little girl worth?” For the sports world, that answer wasn’t clear until Denhollander reminded them that a little girl is worth everything. At the very least, as she pointed out, that little girl is worth protecting. RUNNING Eliud Kipchoge: The Record Breaker Image CreditMaja Hitij/Getty Images By Scott Cacciola After Eliud Kipchoge ran the Berlin Marathon in 2 hours 1 minute 39 seconds to obliterate the world record in September, a lot of people tried really hard to comprehend what he had done. It wasn’t easy, but perhaps the best example of this came a few weeks later at the Chicago Marathon, where attendees of the pre-race exposition were invited to hop on an enormous treadmill and somehow stay aboard while running at a speed of 13 miles an hour — which is really fast. It is also roughly the pace that Kipchoge maintained for the entirety of his record run in Berlin. The people at the marathon expo were being asked to do it for just 200 meters, which worked out to about 35 seconds. Easy, right? Wrong. The results were hilarious. Most of the people who attempted the treadmill experiment tumbled in spectacular fashion, often after just seconds of sprinting all out. And their post-wipeout reactions went something like this: Kipchoge did this for 26.2 miles? Impossible. But sure enough, he did — and the running community is still buzzing about it. It was a cool fall morning in Berlin when Kipchoge, a Kenyan who is now 34, set such a blistering pace — covering the opening 10 kilometers in just over 29 minutes — that two of his three pacesetters had to drop out about 15 minutes later. The third peeled off halfway through the race, leaving Kipchoge to fend for himself for the final 13-plus miles. He made it look effortless. At 5 feet 6 inches and about 115 pounds, Kipchoge skimmed along the pavement with smooth, metronomic strides, breaking the previous record held by Dennis Kimetto, a fellow Kenyan, by 78 seconds — and defeating the second-place finisher by nearly 5 minutes. But most remarkable was that his performance was almost expected. In 2017, at a nonsanctioned event sponsored by Nike, Kipchoge attempted to break two hours with the aid of pacesetters on a race car track in Italy, only to miss by 25 seconds. It seemed a foregone conclusion that he would smash the world record on a sanctioned course given ideal conditions, and he delivered in Berlin, averaging 4:38.4 per mile. His average 5-kilometer pace was 14:24.9, and process this: He did more than eight of those consecutively. Adding to his growing status as a living legend, Kipchoge is something of a philosopher. He reads biographies and keeps a journal. He runs with monastic self-discipline in the hills not far from his hometown in Kenya, but he told me when I met with him in Berlin the week before his record run that he never overextends himself in training. Instead, he said, he reserves his full effort — all 100 percent of himself — for race day, which is a strategy that runs counter to the no-pain, no-gain attitude of so many distance runners. “I want to run with a relaxed mind,” he said. The reigning Olympic marathon champion, Kipchoge has now won 10 of the 11 marathons he has entered, and he told me that he would love to run the New York City Marathon someday. (Race organizers would love to have him, of course.) It is a sign of the times that doping suspicions tend to trail the best athletes — especially when that athlete is a true outlier like Kipchoge, and also when several other Kenyan runners have been caught — but he has steadfastly denied using performance-enhancing drugs, and he has never failed a test for banned substances. So we are left with his body of work, which is unlike anything the marathon world has ever seen. We can only imagine what he will do next. SKIINg Ester Ledecka: The Crossover Image CreditChang W. Lee/The New York Times By Christopher Clarey Before she changed the sense of what was possible in winter sports, Ester Ledecka had to make it clear that no one could change her mind. From an early age, she was intent on being an alpine skier and snowboarder. By the time she reached her teens, she knew she wanted to be an Olympic skier and snowboarder, too. That plan met with plenty of resistance and skepticism from coaches and other experts, who were convinced that she would only be able to excel in one sport at the highest level. But there she was in Pyeongchang in February, winning gold medals in both for the Czech Republic — although not live on NBC, which was under the mistaken impression that the suspense was over and cut away from the super-G competition to other coverage before she could schuss down the mountain and shush the premature celebrations for another skier. Her victory in the women’s super-G was one of the biggest surprises in Olympic history — she had never finished on the podium in a World Cup ski race — but what came next was deeply impressive in a different register. Rather than get rattled by the fallout from her upset, she kept her focus and balance and won the gold medal she was expected to win in Pyeongchang: the parallel giant slalom in snowboarding. Skiers and snowboarders, so often divided into different tribes, were united in admiration. So what will it take for another polymath to follow in her tracks? “Courage, because a lot of people will tell them not to do it,” Ledecka said in a recent telephone interview from Val Gardena, Italy. “I hope after what I’ve achieved, it will be less people, because they will realize it’s possible to do two sports at an elite level. And it doesn’t need to be sports. It could be art or whatever. “But this is the most crucial thing: A lot of people will push you away from your way, your way to the top. And this is what I never had in my mind. I never cared about these people, because I always went for my dreams. And if someone loves these two sports as much as me and is able to start from a young age and work hard for it, then it is possible for sure.” Ledecka, now 23, had undeniable advantages, including an affluent family that could support dual-track training in her youth. Her father, Janek Ledecky, is a prominent Czech musician. But she also had exceptional commitment and talent, and for now she remains a unicorn as she shuttles between World Cup events in alpine skiing and snowboarding. “What she did was amazing, and if you saw our coverage, then you know we did not properly deliver on her story or accomplishment,” said Steve Porino, a former ski racer and longtime NBC skiing reporter. “She did not just show up and borrow a pair of Mikaela Shiffrin’s skis, as we made it sound in our short TV window. She busted her tail as both an alpine skier and snowboarder her entire life. As her dad told me, ‘The only thing we ever had to tell her to do was sleep.’” But even Ledecka faces logistics she cannot conquer. She intended to compete at the world championships in both snowboarding and alpine skiing in 2019. But the final rounds of the parallel giant slalom in snowboarding are on Feb. 4 in Park City, Utah, and the super-G race in alpine skiing is on Feb. 5 in Are, Sweden. “I’m quite sad about that,” she said. “Because I would for sure like to race both, and I was kind of hoping that after what I achieved last year — and after the feedback I’m getting from people where they tell me, ‘Oh, you made the snowboarding sport so much more popular’ — that they might put the snowboarding event like two days earlier. But with this schedule, it’s not possible to do both.” Tom Webb, U.S. Ski and Snowboard’s director of marketing and communications, confirmed that discussions had taken place with the International Ski Federation about changing the schedule to help Ledecka. But Webb said the conclusion was that it could not be done “without causing significant disruption” to both championships. She might have changed the perception of her sports, but her sports are not yet ready to change for her. “With the jetlag and everything, to do both championships I would need to be Superwoman,” she said. “Which I am, a little bit.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Six Athletes Who Transformed Sports.

Scroll to continue with content Ad Here is the schedule for the divisional round of the NFL playoffs: Indianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs, Saturday Jan. 12, 4:35 p.m. ET on NBC The Chiefs don’t get an easy start to their postseason. Kansas City welcomes the Colts, perhaps the hottest team in the NFL. Andrew Luck and the Colts controlled the Houston Texans in wild-card weekend, winning 21-7 in a game that was never in doubt. Indianapolis has won 10 of its last 11 games. This matchup will be one between arguably the top two quarterbacks in the AFC this season. Patrick Mahomes seems like a lock to win MVP, and Luck should be among anyone’s top five. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes will make his first playoff start against the Colts on Saturday. (AP) Dallas Cowboys at Los Angeles Rams, Saturday Jan. 12, 8:15 p.m. ET on Fox Story continues The Cowboys looked like they were headed toward a rematch against the Saints, a team they beat in the regular season, but then the Eagles came back and beat the Bears in the final minute on Sunday evening. That shifted Dallas’ focus to Los Angeles. The game will feature perhaps the two best running backs in the NFL, Ezekiel Elliott of the Cowboys and Todd Gurley of the Rams. Dallas advanced on the strength of its defense in a 24-22 win over the Seahawks, the only home team to win in wild-card weekend. Someone’s long drought will be snapped: The Cowboys haven’t been the NFC championship game since the end of the 1995 season, and the Rams haven’t been that far since the end of the 2001 season. Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots, Sunday Jan. 13, 1:05 p.m. ET on CBS The Chargers are in the weird situation of playing a divisional round game on the road despite having a better record than their opponent. The 12-4 Chargers should give a great challenge to the 11-5 Patriots, who have won back-to-back AFC championships. The Patriots were undefeated at home this season, but the Chargers were 8-1 on the road including a wild-card win over the Ravens. The matchup will pit 41-year-old Patriots quarterback Tom Brady against 37-year-old Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers. Given the star power on both sides, this could be the marquee matchup of the divisional round. Philadelphia Eagles at New Orleans Saints, Sunday Jan. 13, 4:40 p.m. ET on Fox The Nick Foles story keeps going on. Foles, last season’s Super Bowl MVP, led a fourth straight Eagles win, hitting Golden Tate for the game-winning touchdown on fourth down in the final minute against the Bears in a wild-card playoff victory. The Eagles will have a tough challenge at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, where they’ll find a fired-up crowd and a Saints offense led by MVP candidate Drew Brees. The Saints defense has also played very well in the second half of the season. – – – – – – – Frank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

sport Report: Alex Smith Unlikely to be Healthy for Start of 2019 Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Report: Alex Smith Unlikely to be Healthy for Start of 2019 Michael ShapiroSports IllustratedDecember 9, 2018, 3:25 PM GMT Redskins quarterback Alex Smith is "unlikely" to be healthy for the start of the 2019 season, according to the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Smith is currently in the hospital as he battles an infection from surgery on his broken tibia and fibula. The Utah product suffered the injury against Tennessee on Nov. 18. There is no guarantee Smith plays again in the NFL, per Rapoport. Even if Smith does return to the field next season, Washington will likely pursue a quarterback for the start of the season either in free agency or the NFL draft. From @gmfb Weekend: #Redskins QB Alex Smith remains in the hospital, while the team knows at the least, he's unlikely to be ready for the start of 2019. They need to add a QB this offseason. pic.twitter.com/58dizUolUM — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) December 9, 2018 Smith went 6–4 as the Redskins' starter in 2018, throwing 10 touchdowns and five interceptions.

sport Nationals’ Signing of Patrick Corbin Proves Yankees Can Be Outbid - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Nationals’ Signing of Patrick Corbin Proves Yankees Can Be Outbid Supported by On Baseball Nationals’ Signing of Patrick Corbin Proves Yankees Can Be Outbid Image Patrick Corbin was an All-Star last season, and he finished 11-7 with a 3.15 earned run average for Arizona.CreditCreditRick Scuteri/Associated Press By Billy Witz Dec. 4, 2018 When the first big free-agent domino fell on Tuesday, the biggest surprise was not that Patrick Corbin landed a six-year, $140 million contract, it was the team with which he signed it. Corbin, the top pitcher on the market, did not sign with the two suitors close to his hometown in upstate New York: the Philadelphia Phillies, whose owner was prepared to spend “stupid” money over the winter, and the Yankees, who have written the book on it. Instead, the Washington Nationals landed Corbin, a 29-year-old left-hander. The Nationals were flush with cash — the expiring contracts of Bryce Harper, Daniel Murphy, Gio Gonzalez and Matt Wieters free nearly $62 million from their payroll — and probably fueled by last season’s collapse, they were willing to outbid the competition by adding a sixth year to the offer. Corbin, for his part, also gave a little, allowing the Nationals, as is their habit, to defer some of the money, according to a baseball official familiar with the agreement. The deal sends a signal that is heartening for baseball: At least in the National League East, most everyone is trying to win. The division champion Atlanta Braves landed third baseman Josh Donaldson, the American League Most Valuable Player three years ago, on a one-year, $23 million flier. The Mets acquired an elite closer in Edwin Diaz and an aging middle-of-the-lineup bat in Robinson Cano. And while the Phillies may have lost out on Corbin, they should be in the chase for the premier free agents in this class: Manny Machado and Harper. In Washington, Corbin joins a rotation where he will be third fiddle — behind Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, who are down for $37 million and $38 million next season. Those are the types of salaries that used to regularly dot the Yankees’ ledger. Sometimes it was money well spent (C. C. Sabathia) and sometimes it was not (Jacoby Ellsbury), but the deals had at least one commonality: They reinforced the notion that the only bottom line that mattered was winning the World Series. Now it is no longer so. Fiscal responsibility reigns. The Yankees, though they did take on what remained of Giancarlo Stanton’s 13-year, $325 million contract last December, went through financial contortions to stay below the luxury tax threshold for the first time last season. General Manager Brian Cashman has said that he has been given a budget by Hal Steinbrenner, but has declined to say if it is above the new luxury tax threshold of $206 million, which is $9 million more than last season. The Yankees have occasionally lost out on free agents over the years — Greg Maddux didn’t care much for New York, and Curt Schilling was intrigued by the possibility of ending the Red Sox playoff drought — but it is exceedingly rare for them to pursue one of the top players on the market and be outbid. About the only example that comes to mind is Cano, whom the Yankees were wary of committing to for 10 years. The Yankees made a similar calculus with Corbin, whom they viewed as a very good pitcher — they had tried to trade for him last winter — but one who had several middling seasons after Tommy John surgery before blossoming last season. He was 11-7 with a 3.15 earned run average, making the All-Star team and finishing fifth in the N.L. Cy Young voting. The Yankees liked Corbin plenty, but they did not view him as a top-of-the-rotation pitcher and thus did not want to give him a sixth year. Their final offer, according to a baseball official familiar with the negotiation, was five years and $100 million. So, instead of reading tea leaves last week — the order of Corbin’s visits was Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and the report that Corbin’s brother put on a Yankees cap while delivering a toast at Corbin’s wedding — it was better to have listened. Cashman was asked on Friday, a day after Corbin’s visit, if he was waiting on Corbin as a primary target. “There’s a lot of players of interest to us and a lot of players that can improve us, both in free agency and trade, so I wouldn’t designate anyone as a primary,” Cashman said. “There’s a lot of attractive players that are available for various price points.” Now the Yankees will pivot. Their pursuit of pitching to augment Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka and Sabathia already resulted in a trade with Seattle for James Paxton, and will now shift toward the next-level free agents — Dallas Keuchel, Nathan Eovaldi and J. A. Happ — and what could be a robust trade market with Cleveland’s Corey Kluber headlining it. Only time will tell if the Yankees were wise not to invest in Corbin. Cashman has been shrewd in rebuilding the Yankees through their farm system, but his reluctance to take on the salary of Justin Verlander two years ago and — to a lesser degree — his unwillingness to part with a prospect like Miguel Andujar to land Gerrit Cole loom as what-ifs. But there was no equivocation about what happened on Tuesday. If this season’s Yankees do win the franchise’s 28th World Series title, it will not have been at any cost.

sport Rick Barry doesn't get why Kevin Durant would want to leave Warriors Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Rick Barry doesn't get why Kevin Durant would want to leave Warriors Ali ThanawallaNBC Sports BayAreaJanuary 5, 2019, 5:05 PM GMT Rick Barry doesn't get why Kevin Durant would want to leave WarriorsKevin Durant has a big decision to make this summer. And one former Warriors legend weighed in on that decision. Rick Barry doesn't get why Kevin Durant would want to leave Warriors originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.com When the 2018-19 season concludes, regardless of whether the Warriors win a third straight NBA title or they get dethroned, Kevin Durant has a decision to make that could change the course of NBA history. Does he re-sign with the Warriors and keep the dynasty together? Or does Durant leave for a new challenge elsewhere? Scroll to continue with content Ad Those are the $200 million questions everyone wants the answer to. Warriors legend Rick Barry can't fathom why Durant would choose the latter option. "My big thing is, I don't understand why you'd want to leave a situation where you become multiple [time] champions and have a record very few teams ever approach having," Barry said on KNBR 680 on Friday. "Why would you want to do that knowing that you don't have to be the main guy and have all that responsibility all the time knowing that you're going to get your times, your chances. He was [NBA Finals] MVP two times in a row. You've got great players on your team. To break that team up would be a shame." Durant made his top free agent priority clear in a recent sit-down interview with Yahoo's Chris Haynes. "I just want to make sure I get as much money as I can on my next deal so I can stack up my money and figure it out," Durant told Haynes. "That's just the plan. Play basketball and stack money." If Durant is all about the money, his best bet is to stay with the Warriors. According to The Athletic's Danny Leroux, Golden State can offer Durant a five-year, $221.3 million contract. Other teams can only offer up to four years and $164 million.

sport College Football Playoff: Alabama vs. Oklahoma; Clemson vs. Notre Dame - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|College Football Playoff: Alabama vs. Oklahoma; Clemson vs. Notre Dame Supported by College Football Playoff: Alabama vs. Oklahoma; Clemson vs. Notre Dame Image Oklahoma, led by Kyler Murray, grabbed the fourth spot in the College Football Playoff.CreditCreditJeffrey Mcwhorter/Associated Press By Marc Tracy Dec. 2, 2018 ATLANTA — The Oklahoma Sooners (12-1) received the final slot in the four-team College Football Playoff on Sunday over primary contenders Ohio State (12-1) and Georgia (11-2), a move that sidestepped the most controversial possible decision in the playoff’s fifth season. The other three teams chosen for the playoff are No. 1 Alabama (13-0), No. 2 Clemson (13-0) and No. 3 Notre Dame (12-0). In the national semifinals, Clemson will play Notre Dame at the Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Tex., on the afternoon of Dec. 29, and Alabama will play Oklahoma at the Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla. in the evening. The winners will play for the national championship on Jan. 7 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Georgia was ranked fifth in the selection committee’s final rankings, while Ohio State was ranked sixth. Due to a separate contract, the Buckeyes will play the Pacific-12 champion, Washington, in the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. The Sooners had been ranked fifth before Saturday’s games, just below the Bulldogs at fourth. Ohio State had been sixth. Georgia nearly toppled Alabama in the Southeastern Conference title game here, but the Crimson Tide, behind the starter-turned-backup quarterback Jalen Hurts, came from behind to win, 35-28. Meanwhile, Oklahoma decisively defeated Texas, which in October was the sole team to hand the Sooners a loss this season. Image Notre Dame players celebrated after scoring a touchdown in their victory over Florida State.CreditMatt Cashore/USA Today Sports, via Reuters In an interview on ESPN shortly after the rankings were released, Rob Mullens, the Oregon athletic director who is the selection committee chairman, said that there was no consensus that any of Oklahoma, Georgia or Ohio State was “unequivocally” better than the other two. At that point, he said, the committee deferred to the protocol it is supposed to use to break ties, which includes conference championships. On Saturday, Oklahoma had won its conference championship, while Georgia had failed to. “No one was unequivocally better than the other,” Mullens said, “so then we leaned on the protocol.” Yet the ranking of Georgia above Ohio State — which, like Oklahoma, won its conference on Saturday — essentially indicated that the room did feel Georgia was unequivocally better than Ohio State, as the tiebreaker would have led Ohio State to be ranked higher. Ohio State fans were able to claim a modicum of redemption, though. If the Buckeyes’ 49-20 loss to Purdue (6-6) in October was one of the two most consequential defeats of the season, the other was Georgia’s 36-16 loss at Louisiana State (9-3) in October. Louisiana State’s quarterback, Joe Burrow, who threw for 200 yards against Georgia, had transferred from Ohio State. Several observers on social media and even on ESPN claimed that Las Vegas point-spreads are proof that Georgia, not Oklahoma, was the best of the three teams. Mullens said there was “strong debate, even division in the room.” Central Florida (12-0), the final undefeated team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, was apparently not considered for the playoff. U.C.F. was No. 8 in the committee’s last rankings and defeated Memphis, 56-41, to win its second straight American Athletic Conference title. The Knights have a 25-game winning streak and last year self-claimed a national title alongside the one Alabama won. But yet again the committee indicated that teams from the so-called Group of Five conferences are unlikely to receive serious playoff consideration. From its official Twitter feed, Central Florida suggested it might be able to find a way to claim a national title again. As the highest-ranked Group of Five champion, Central Florida, which was No. 8 in the final rankings, was guaranteed a spot in a prominent bowl. The Knights will play No. 11 Louisiana State (9-3) in the Fiesta Bowl on New Year’s Day, and Georgia will face Texas in the Sugar Bowl, also on New Year’s Day. No. 7 Michigan (10-2) will play No. 10 Florida (9-3) in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 29. In selecting the Sooners over the Bulldogs, the committee, and the playoff itself, avoided alienating at least one of its patrons. Had it chosen Georgia instead, the committee would have for the first time left three of the five major conferences — the Big 12, the Big Ten and the Pacific-12 — outside the playoff (Notre Dame is independent). And it would have further devalued the importance of conference titles, since it would have had to reject three major-conference champions in favor of the Bulldogs. Alabama, as the top seed, has the right to home-field advantage, and indicated that it did not wish to play Oklahoma at the Dallas Cowboys’ stadium, a few hours down Interstate-35 from its campus in Norman, according to ESPN, the network that broadcasts the playoff. The Crimson Tide quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, a Heisman Trophy hopeful, is expected to be out with an ankle injury for roughly two weeks, Alabama Coach Nick Saban said on ESPN. It is the third year that the Big 12 has been included in the playoff. It has been represented by Oklahoma all three times. And it is the second year in a row that the Big Ten has been excluded despite a strong champion in Ohio State. The Pacific-12, which staged its championship game Friday night between two three-loss teams, was widely understood to have no shot at the playoff. It is the third year in five that the league is not represented. It is Clemson’s fourth straight year in the playoff. And Alabama, the dominant dynasty of its era, has never missed it.

sport Cubs Offer the Suspended Shortstop Addison Russell a 2019 Contract - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Baseball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Baseball|Cubs Offer the Suspended Shortstop Addison Russell a 2019 Contract Supported by Cubs Offer the Suspended Shortstop Addison Russell a 2019 Contract Image Cubs shortstop Addison Russell will be eligible to return from his suspension on May 3, against St. Louis, barring any postponements.CreditCreditNick Wass/Associated Press By The Associated Press Nov. 30, 2018 CHICAGO — The Cubs offered shortstop Addison Russell a 2019 contract while maintaining on Friday that his future with the team was not certain. Russell is serving a 40-game domestic violence suspension from Major League Baseball after his ex-wife, Melisa Reidy, accused him in a blog post of years of physical and emotional abuse. Theo Epstein, the Cubs’ president for baseball operations, called the decision a “procedural step” and said it did “not represent the finish line nor rubber stamp his future” with the club. “It does, however, reflect our support for him as long as he continues to make progress and demonstrates his commitment to these important issues,” Epstein added. Teams had a deadline of Friday to offer contracts to unsigned players on their 40-man rosters. Russell accepted the suspension in October for violating the league’s domestic violence policy. Though Russell has denied the allegations, he apologized to Reidy and his family for “my past behavior.” Russell had a $3.2 million salary last season. His unpaid suspension includes the 11 regular-season games he missed after being placed on administrative leave Sept. 21. Russell will be eligible to return on May 3, against St. Louis, barring any postponements. “Since accepting my suspension, I’ve had time to reflect on my past behavior and think about the next steps I need to take to grow as a person,” Russell said in a statement issued by the Cubs. Russell said he would meet regularly with experts and counselors mandated by his treatment plan. He said he also planned to keep working with his own therapist, whom he has been seeing several times a week for the past two months. He also hopes to work with nonprofit groups in Pensacola, Fla., his hometown, as well as in Chicago and Arizona “to become part of the solution.” “I am just in the early stages of this process,” Russell said. “It is work that goes far beyond being a baseball player. It goes to my core values of being the best family man, partner and teammate that I can be, and giving back to the community and the less fortunate. While there is a lot of work ahead for me to earn back the trust of the Cubs’ fans, my teammates and the entire organization, it’s work that I am 110 percent committed to doing.” Epstein said the Cubs had consulted with domestic violence experts to help them raise awareness and prevent more incidents, and the team had remained in touch with Reidy “to support her and to listen.” Epstein said he and the franchise’s chairman, Tom Ricketts, had met with Russell in Chicago this week to “assess his progress and communicate our expectations as he works to earn back the trust of our fans and entire organization.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Russell, Still Suspended, Gets Offer From the Cubs.

The Red Storm had lost 13 consecutive games at Georgetown. Their last win there was on Jan. 18, 2003. St. John’s started overtime on a 7-1 run, and Ponds made one of two free throws with 23 seconds left for a 97-94 lead. Georgetown had two looks at a potential tying 3-pointer, but James Akinjo did not hit the rim, and Jahvon Blair’s open shot from the wing bounced out. Georgetown, playing without guard Mac McClung (ankle) and forward Trey Mourning (concussion), was leading by 5 points with 52 seconds left in regulation, but Ponds made two free throws with 14 seconds left, and L. J. Figueroa came up with a steal and sank two free throws, tying it with 11.3 seconds left to play. Justin Simon added 14 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists for St. John’s (14-1, 2-1 Big East). Jessie Govan had 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Josh LeBlanc also had a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds for Georgetown (11-4, 1-2).

Previously high-scoring Nevada (14-1, 1-1 Mountain West) shot just 33.3 percent (19 for 57) from the field and committed 14 turnovers. The Wolf Pack also went 16 for 27 at the free-throw line. Vance Jackson had 18 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals for the Lobos (8-6, 2-0). ALABAMA 77, KENTUCKY 75 Tevin Mack made six first-half 3-pointers on his way to 22 points, and host Alabama (10-3) held off No. 13 Kentucky (10-3) in the Southeastern Conference opener for both teams. Dazon Ingram scored all 11 of his points after halftime, including some key free throws, in the Crimson Tide’s fifth consecutive win. The Wildcats gave them a big scare in the final seconds after surging back from 11 points down. Tyler Herro’s 3-point try for the win at the buzzer bounced off the rim. VIRGINIA 65, FLORIDA STATE 52 Kyle Guy scored 21 points, and No. 4 Virginia limited No. 9 Florida State to just 15 field goals in Charlottesville, Va. Guy scored 18 of his points in the first half as the Cavaliers (13-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) took a 42-23 lead.

MICHIGAN STATE 86, OHIO STATE 77 Cassius Winston scored 25 points, Nick Ward added 21, and No. 8 Michigan State extended its unbeaten streak to eight games with a victory at No. 14 Ohio State. The score in the second half was tied six times before the Spartans (13-2, 4-0 Big Ten) took the lead on a Ward free throw. A layup by Kenny Goins put them up by 3 with about three and a half minutes left. Ohio State (12-2, 2-1) narrowed the deficit to 6 points twice in the final minute but could not get closer. Kaleb Wesson scored 25 points for the Buckeyes, and Luther Muhammed had 12. VIRGINIA TECH 77, BOSTON COLLEGE 66 Nickeil Alexander-Walker scored 25 points, leading No. 10 Virginia Tech over visiting Boston College in the A.C.C. Alexander-Walker made 9 of 14 from the floor for the Hokies (13-1, 2-0), who overcame a cold-shooting first half and won their eighth consecutive game. Boston College (9-4, 0-1) led early in the second half, but Virginia Tech took control with an 11-0 run. SYRACUSE 72, NOTRE DAME 62 Elijah Hughes, a redshirt junior guard, had career highs of 22 points and 10 rebounds as Syracuse dominated down the stretch and won at Notre Dame.

sport How the Troy Tulowitzki Signing Affects the Yankees’ Pursuit of Manny Machado - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|How the Troy Tulowitzki Signing Affects the Yankees’ Pursuit of Manny Machado Supported by How the Troy Tulowitzki Signing Affects the Yankees’ Pursuit of Manny Machado Image Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman discussed the team’s new shortstop on Friday and the signing’s impact on the pursuit of Manny Machado.CreditCreditFrank Franklin Ii/Associated Press By Billy Witz Jan. 4, 2019 If anyone thought the Yankees’ acquisition of Troy Tulowitzki, which was completed on Friday, was going to provide some clarity about the rest of their winter plans — particularly the pursuit of the infielder Manny Machado — well, good luck with that. General Manager Brian Cashman, in a conference call with reporters on Friday, said his scouts had been so impressed with Tulowitzki in two workouts that they plan to turn the shortstop job over to him until Didi Gregorius returns from Tommy John surgery, whether that is in June, July or August. Tulowitzki has not played since 2017. As for whether the signing of Tulowitzki, who agreed to a one-year, minimum-salary contract, takes the Yankees out of contention for Machado, Cashman said: “I can’t say what it would take us out of. But I will say we’re going in with a commitment level to try Troy Tulowitzki at shortstop.” The Yankees are not inclined to go near the type of 10-year, $300 million contract that Machado is seeking, but if his market turns out to be less than robust — he has met with only two other teams, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago White Sox — he could still be in the team’s plans at third base. Cashman said he had continued to speak with Machado’s agent, Dan Lozano, but did not characterize the conversations or say when they had taken place. If the Yankees did land Machado to play third, it would allow them to package their own promising young third baseman, Miguel Andujar, in a trade for a starting pitcher. Image Troy Tulowitzki at spring training with the Blue Jays in 2018. He hasn’t played in a major league game since 2017.CreditFrank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press That, of course, is the primary area the Yankees were intent on bolstering in the off-season, which they did by trading for James Paxton and re-signing J. A. Happ as a free agent. But C. C. Sabathia, who was brought back on a one-year contract, needed an angioplasty last month to clear a blockage near his heart. Doctors will evaluate him this month to determine whether he will be ready for spring training, which begins in five weeks, or for opening day. Sabathia’s condition led Cashman to say for the first time that he might consider keeping pitcher Sonny Gray to start the season. Cashman had said he would trade Gray this winter after one and a half lackluster seasons and doubts that he would pitch to his potential in New York. Cashman did not directly address the bullpen after one potential candidate, David Robertson, signed with the Phillies on Thursday. But the Yankees have continued talks with Zach Britton about returning and with another free agent, Adam Ottavino. One hole they believe they have filled is at shortstop. While Cashman acknowledged Tulowitzki’s lengthy injury history — he has been unable to play more than 91 games in four of the last seven seasons — he added that Tulowitzki “looked like he’d got that bounce back in his step” during two workouts the Yankees recently observed in Long Beach, Calif. As for where Tulowitzki, 34, will fit in upon the return of Gregorius at shortstop, Cashman said the Yankees would use the first few months of the season to make that evaluation. INSIDE PITCH To make room for Troy Tulowitzki on the 40-man roster, the Yankees designated pitcher A. J. Cole for assignment. … Brian Cashman clarified the roster status of two other pitchers: Luis Cessa is out of options, so he must either make the roster or be released, and Domingo German, contrary to some reports, has one option remaining.

sport How to Make a Bucking Bull: Good Breeding and, Just Maybe, a Cow’s Love - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Science Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Science|How to Make a Bucking Bull: Good Breeding and, Just Maybe, a Cow’s Love Supported by How to Make a Bucking Bull: Good Breeding and, Just Maybe, a Cow’s Love It takes a high-tech village to raise a champion animal for bull riding. The cowboys, bred the old-fashioned way, can barely keep up. Image A bull attempting to throw a rider at the Professional Bull Riders annual rodeo at Madison Square Garden on Friday.CreditCreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times By James Gorman Jan. 5, 2019 Each year, when the bucking bulls arrive at Madison Square Garden, livestock trailers pull into 33rd Street and back up to ramps that lead five floors up to the arena. The bulls — 50 or so — come for the opening event in the Professional Bull Riders circuit, which this year runs Jan. 4-6. Cowboys on horses, letting loose an occasional whoop or holler, herd them up the ramps. The bulls soon emerge into a kind of animal-athlete locker room, with a dirt floor and strong steel bars arranged horizontally to form stalls. Some bulls walk calmly into the mazelike corral. Some trot. Some come in hot, trying to charge the workers, who quickly climb the steel bars to get out of the way. This is only the locker room, of course; the bulls don’t have to bed down at the arena. Once the event is over and the cowboys head to their hotel, the bulls are trucked back to more comfortable quarters in New Jersey for a restful night. Bull riding is a big business, and a big-time sport, involving both human and animal athletes. For the riders, it’s astonishingly dangerous; in 2018 one rider died at a Professional Bull Riders event in Brazil, and two others died at non-P.B.R. events. The list of injuries on the organization’s site is long and disturbing, dominated by concussions, with the occasional fractured sternum, joint separation or severe facial laceration. Image A bull named Lab Rat during a weigh-in at Madison Square Garden on Thursday.CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times For the past 15 years or so, bucking bulls have been intensively bred like racehorses to make them harder to ride. Breeders use high-tech reproductive techniques and a detailed, computerized registry of 180,000 bulls and cows. Cowboys have continued to be bred the old-fashioned way The products of this intensive artificial selection have one job: to buck, spin and kick as hard and unpredictably as they can with a rider on board. If the rider stays on for eight seconds, he is scored for how well he rode, the bull is scored for how hard he was to ride and the scores are combined. Calves that don’t buck may end up at the slaughterhouse, but for those who do buck, it’s a sweet life, at least according to breeders. Matt Scharping, who owns Phenom Genetics in Minnesota, said, “If you’re born a really good bucking bull it’s like winning the bovine lottery.” The lucky bulls are carefully fed, gradually exposed to the lights and noise of a rodeo environment to reduce stress and, if they prove successful, retired to lives as semen producers. Some are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. The semen can sell for thousands of dollars per straw, about a tenth of a teaspoon. The end result of all this effort, unsurprisingly, is that the bulls are becoming harder to ride. In earlier times, a rider had a chance to draw an easy bull. Now, all the bulls are hard, as both the riders and breeders will attest. In 1995, cowboys finished their rides 46 percent of the time; in 2012 they managed just 26 percent. Since then, the cowboys seem to have caught on a bit: their success rate has hovered around 29 percent for the past two years. Still, getting thrown 71 percent of the time means absorbing a lot of pain. Image A bull named Lester Gillis shook off Claudio Montanha Jr. in less than two seconds. Lester Gillis was successfully ridden just twice in 2018, in 16 tries, a toss rate of 87.5 percent.

CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times J. B. Mauney, 31, is one of the best riders in the sport. He famously broke a streak by a bull named Bushwhacker, who had thrown riders 40 times in a row. Mauney hit the dirt in eight of those abbreviated rides. That was because he kept choosing Bushwhacker when he had the chance. “It was kind of a pride deal,” he said. On Mauney’s ninth ride, in 2013, he lasted the eight seconds, barely. Bushwhacker was retired in 2014 after 64 “outs,” or times he had entered the arena with a cowboy on his back. He was successfully ridden just twice. Mauney, who also has bred bulls, said he thinks bulls will only become more difficult to master. “If they keep breeding better bulls, they’re going to have to start breeding better bull riders,” he said. Unlike other rodeo events, bull riding does not have its origin in ranch skills. Horses had to be ridden, calves branded, steers roped, but nobody needed anyone, ever, to ride a bull. The unnecessary risk to life and limb is the whole point — like walking a high wire without a net. The event was something of a novelty until the 1950s, when a few star riders emerged. By the 1980s the event had become popular, and in 1992 it broke off on its own, as the Professional Bull Riders circuit. In 2004, a registry of bucking-bull pedigrees, American Bucking Bull, Inc., was founded. It is owned jointly by the bull-riders association and the breeders, and keeps tabs on 180,00 bulls and cows. The registry group also promotes events in which young bulls compete without riders, potentially earning hundreds of thousands of dollars for their breeders. Image Unlike other rodeo events, bull riding does not have its origin in ranch skills. It was a novelty until the 1950s, when a few stars began to emerge.CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times Among the best of those breeders is H.D. Page, of D&H Cattle, which owns SweetPro’s Bruiser, a three-time world champion bull. Like many other breeders, Page uses every available technique, including artificial insemination, egg collection, in vitro fertilization and the use of sperm selected to produce only bull calves. Bucking bulls have even been cloned and used in competition. But bull cloning met with a backlash about five years ago, framed partly in religious terms. At the time, one breeder in Texas, Scott Accomazzo, said he had been accused of playing God, and his Christianity had been questioned. The current trend in breeding is to focus on the cows. Bull riding may be the most masculinized of all sports, with its emphasis on danger and power, but champion semen does not guarantee success in the ring. “There’s certain cow families,” Page said. “The female side of it. That’s key.” Matt Scharping, of Phenom Genetics, agreed: “It’s really all about the cows. I feel like 80 percent of the bucking ability is coming from the mother.” Image Despite how the bulls appear in the ring, they're not angry. “What’s funny is that the bulls themselves are generally very companionable,” said one animal-relations expert. CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times It’s a conclusion drawn from experience, not scientific research. Scharping said he valued a cow’s bucking-bull pedigree, but also how mothers raise their calves. Rodeos and bull-riding are often criticized by animal welfare groups, and the bull-riders association is at pains to highlight its rules against the use of cattle prods and other inducements to buck. Jeannette Vaught, a lecturer in Liberal Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, who has written about human-animal interactions, including rodeos, said that she didn’t see direct or obvious cruelty in the treatment of the successful bucking bulls. “There’s a common misconception that the flank strap is painful,” she said. “It’s not.” The strap, worn around the bull’s abdomen, does cause enough discomfort to prompt the bulls to buck, but seasoned animals, who get used to bucking as soon as the chute opens, don’t even notice it. And as furious as the animal may seem during its eight seconds in the ring, “the bull is not angry,” Vaught said. “What’s funny is that the bulls themselves are generally very companionable.” Mauney, and other riders, said it’s the bull’s job to buck and the rider’s job to hang on. No animosity either way. The bulls that Vaught had seen were “very chill,” she said. “But they know their job. After the bucking ends, they are really quite friendly animals. They’re laborers. They’ve been bred to do this work.” Image Arriving at Madison Square Garden on Friday for the competition.CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York Times Earlier reporting about bull riding and rodeos Video The ‘Controlled Rage’ of Bull RidingJan. 8, 2017 What Is Bull Riding’s Scariest Beast Afraid Of?

sport Liverpool Extends Lead in Premier League as Manchester City Falls Again - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Soccer Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Soccer|Liverpool Extends Lead in Premier League as Manchester City Falls Again Supported by roundup Liverpool Extends Lead in Premier League as Manchester City Falls Again Image Liverpool’s Virgil Van Dijk with Newcastle’s Jamaal Lascelles. Liverpool extended its Premier League lead to six points.CreditCreditLee Smith/Reuters By The Associated Press Dec. 26, 2018 Liverpool moved six points clear at the top of the English Premier League after strolling past visiting Newcastle, 4-0, at Anfield on Wednesday. Defending champion Manchester City suffered its second surprise loss in four days, falling to Leicester, 2-1, and surrendering second place to Tottenham. Tottenham followed up its 6-2 romp at Everton on Sunday with another big win as Son Heung-min scored twice in a 5-0 thrashing of Bournemouth that took the London club one point ahead of Manchester City in the standings. Liverpool showed just how desperate it is to secure the club’s first top-flight title since 1990. Struggling Newcastle last won in the league at Anfield in 1994, and the former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez’s decision to rest his leading scorer, Salomon Rondon, did not say much for its ambitions Wednesday. The floodgates opened in the 11th minute when the combination of a poor Jamaal Lascelles header and a striker’s finish from defender Dejan Lovren produced the opening goal. Three minutes after the halftime break, Paul Dummett hauled down Mohamed Salah in the penalty area, and Salah, Liverpool’s top scorer, converted the penalty for his sixth goal in five matches. Xherdan Shaqiri pounced on a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross to make it 3-0 with 11 minutes remaining, and then the substitute Fabinho bundled home a corner as the home team kept its 12th clean sheet of the campaign, the same number it achieved when it last won the title. Image Son Heung-min scores Tottenham’s fifth goal — its 11th in two games — in a 5-0 win over Bournemouth at Wembley.CreditMatthew Childs/Reuters At Leicester, Manchester City tumbled into third place, seven points behind Liverpool and one behind Tottenham, and lost defender Fabian Delph to a straight red card in its 2-1 defeat. Sergio Agüero and Kevin de Bruyne were back in the starting lineup, and City took control after 14 minutes. Aymeric Laporte stepped out of the defense and laid a pass into the feet of Agüero, who helped the ball on to the unmarked Bernardo Silva to score. But five minutes later, Leicester striker Jamie Vardy raced down the left and his cross was headed in at the far post by Marc Albrighton. Roberto Pereira dealt a seismic blow to City’s title challenge with nine minutes remaining when he latched on to Leroy Sané’s attempted clearance to fire a right-foot shot beyond goalkeeper Ederson. City defender Fabian Delph was then sent off for a straight red card after catching Pereira with his studs after having taken a swipe at the ball. It is the first time City has lost two straight league matches since December 2016. In London, meanwhile, surging Tottenham reeled off an eighth victory in nine Premier League games by routing Bournemouth, 5-0, at Wembley. Two goals by Son Heung-min and one apiece from Christian Eriksen, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane took Spurs, which mauled Everton by 6-2 on Saturday, up to second place in the standings. In Manchester, Paul Pogba grabbed two goals to help the interim coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrate his first home match in charge of Manchester United with a 3-1 victory against last-place Huddersfield. IN OTHER GAMES Juventus tried to give Cristiano Ronaldo a rest, but Manager Massimiliano Allegri was forced to bring on the Portuguese star for the final 25 minutes with Juventus trailing and down to 10 men. Ronaldo leveled but did not have time to completely rescue Juventus, which was held to a 2-2 draw at Atalanta. It was only the second time this season that Juventus has dropped points in Serie A, but it ended up extending its advantage in the standings to nine points, ahead of second-placed Napoli, which lost at Inter Milan, 1-0. “All considered it’s a good point against a good team,” Allegri said. “We were good in not going out of the match when we went down to 10 men.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Liverpool Extends Premier League Lead.

If you’re around an old-school type, you’ll probably overhear something about how this fight somehow propels the Oilers to victory rather than Ken Hitchcock’s patented “Connor McDavid scores the only goal” formula.

sport Christmastime in Naples: Jesus, Mary and Ronaldo - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Subscribe Log In Soccer|Christmastime in Naples: Jesus, Mary and Ronaldo Image CreditCreditPete Kiehart for The New York Times Christmastime in Naples: Jesus, Mary and Ronaldo A pedestrian road in this Italian city is famous for its handmade nativity scenes, but its visitors are as likely to encounter well-known soccer figures as biblical ones. CreditCreditPete Kiehart for The New York Times Supported by By Andrew Keh Photographs by Pete Kiehart Dec. 20, 2018 NAPLES, Italy — Up and down this cramped pedestrian street there are little clay statues of Cristiano Ronaldo, unmistakable in their form: legs spread shoulder-width apart, arms shooting at the ground, hair gelled into a luscious wave. There are also fat Ronaldos; weirdly skinny Ronaldos; Ronaldos with faces that resemble “The Scream,” by Edvard Munch; and many, many other Ronaldos that, in general, look very little like the actual Ronaldo. Together, the diminutive Ronaldos represent an ever-growing segment of the colorful Christmastime panoply on Via San Gregorio Armeno, a historical street in the heart of Naples, Italy, that has been known since the 1800s as a spiritual home of artisans specializing in traditional nativity scenes, or presepi. Many consider the traditional figurines from these Neapolitan workshops — intricate models of biblical figures crafted from wood, clay, wire and fine cloth — to be refined works of art. Yet casual visitors to the street these days might be more likely to encounter the clay statuettes of celebrities and pop culture figures that now dominate the famous street’s storefronts and curbside tables. And in a soccer-crazy city like Naples, it is natural that soccer players, and the clay representations of them, have begun to receive top billing. “It’s hard to explain, but it’s like a visceral faith,” Marco Ferrigno, a fourth-generation artisan who owns one of the most famous workshops on the street, said of the city’s soccer obsession. “So players can become idols — to the extreme, sometimes.” Image Marco Ferrigno in his workshop on Via San Gregorio Armeno. Image Teodor Minchev paints the head of a figurine at the workshop. Alongside all the baby Jesuses and the different Ronaldos, then, holiday shoppers can find handcrafted figurines of Francesco Totti taking a selfie, Kylian Mbappé with his arms folded across his chest, Lionel Messi pointing two hands to the sky and almost every current member of Napoli, the beloved local team. The statues can reference recent games, major accomplishments, trademark gestures or humorous incidents. The transfer market and league standings can dictate stores’ inventory. Artisans can glorify players or antagonize them. The sidewalk stalls feature enough soccer players to populate a statuette World Cup, and the street, in turn, has developed a divided identity: part sacred museum, part tourist trap, part art gallery, part miniature Madame Tussauds. “The market demanded it,” Isabella Esposito, 54, whose family has owned a store on the street since 1950, said of the dense display of soccer player sculptures in front of her store. It was not always this way. Nativity scenes became prominent in Naples in the late 1700s as an art form besides painting that the city’s nobility could patronize. Over the next century, the city’s presepi took on a distinct style: dense, ornate and full of life, situating religious figures like the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus on Neapolitan streetscapes alongside other generically pastoral characters, like pizza makers. According to Marino Niola, an anthropologist at the Suor Orsola Benincasa University of Naples who wrote a book in 2005 called “Il Presepe,” the nativity scene tradition experienced a dip in popularity after World War II. Niola said it was no coincidence then that the nativity scene — which he called “a ritualistic toy to play a metaphysical game” — started making a comeback in the mid-1990s, once artisans on Via San Gregorio Armeno began introducing pop culture figures to their inventory of statuettes. Image A figurine commemorates Luis Suarez's bite of Giorgio Chiellini in the 2014 World Cup. Image Genny Di Virgilio set up a display including Ronaldo, Freddie Mercury and Donald Trump in front of the Di Virgilio family workshop. In the beginning, of course, there was Diego Maradona. In 1987, the Argentine superstar led Napoli to its first Italian league title — an event locals jokingly compare these days to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. And a couple of years later, Maradona became the first soccer player to appear in the city’s nativity scene shops. (A national political scandal in 1992 known as Mani Pulite was another early muse for the city’s nativity scene artisans.) Even today, Maradona is nobly featured in nearly every presepe shop on the street, always with flowing hair, always with short shorts. “He was an idol, and becoming a figure in the nativity scene was a form of sanctification,” Niola said of Maradona. Not everyone has enjoyed the developments in the industry. Vincenzo Nicolella, artistic director of the Neapolitan Association of the Presepe, said he was concerned that the universe of acceptable nativity scene characters was expanding too rapidly. Since the 1990s, traditional shops have prominently featured figurines of politicians, actors, singers and even, more recently, Instagram influencers alongside the soccer stars. Traditional nativity scene figures, meanwhile, are often relegated indoors and out of plain sight. Nicolella grew particularly agitated last year when he noticed “Star Wars” characters sold in the shops. Image Tourists and shoppers crowd Via San Gregorio Armeno. “An intervention is necessary to say, ‘Hold on, please keep your hands off the presepe,’” he said. “We cannot forget that we are speaking of a high quality artistic tradition.” Many artisans and merchants, though, have accepted that they have to straddle the two worlds, sacred and secular. They say the soccer players and celebrities invite younger generations to learn about a craft that can otherwise feel old-fashioned. Sitting at a squat wooden desk passed down to him from his grandfather, Genny Di Virgilio proudly showed off the delicate handmade pieces inside his family workshop, which his great-grandfather opened in 1930. Like many of the other shops, the Di Virgilio workshop stocks little red horn amulets, which look a bit like chili peppers and are meant to ward off bad luck (“We have a saying in Naples: ‘It’s not true, but I believe it’”) and figurines that cleverly piggyback on international politics. (“We sold a lot of statues of Trump last year,” he said. “Mamma mia.”) Di Virgilio said that the traditional religious figurines, some of which can cost thousands of euros apiece, represented most of his business, but that the soccer figurines, which are around 20 euros apiece, garnered the most attention from passers-by. There is a clay statue of Zinedine Zidane head-butting Marco Materazzi at the 2006 World Cup and, nearby, a photograph of Materazzi holding it, a big smile on his face. In fact, the entire store (like Ferrigno’s) is covered with photographs of soccer players holding their own likenesses in nativity scene statuette form. Di Virgilio coolly rattled off the names of players he has met — Edinson Cavani, Marek Hamsik, Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens, Mauro Icardi, Mario Balotelli — before trailing off. Image Genny Di Virgilio works on a figurine in his workshop. “They become children again when they see the sculptures,” Di Virgilio said. Di Virgilio said Ronaldo became his top seller this year after joining Juventus from Real Madrid, and he has been happy to feature the striker prominently in the store. “I’m a Napoli fan, and an anti-Juventus fan, but in business we have to make amends,” he said. Such generosity is not extended to all players, apparently. Di Virgilio currently sells a statue of Gonzalo Higuaín, a former Napoli player, with devil horns and a sign that reads, “ungrateful heart,” in Neapolitan slang. Higuaín was seen to have betrayed the city when he decamped for Juventus two years ago. At another store up the street, Higuaín is depicted holding a platter with three babàs — a vaguely mushroom-shaped, traditional Neapolitan pastry — symbolizing the three goals Napoli scored against his current team, A.C. Milan, earlier this season. Di Virgilio cringed at the idea that people might place one of his soccer player figurines inside a traditional nativity scene. But many do. Anyway, he said, customers in the last couple of years have been coming into his store and requesting a new sort of product: clay figurines of themselves. Could a celebrity-obsessed generation give way to a cohort of narcissists? “I have 30 of them to make before Dec. 24,” he said last week, shrugging. Brando de Leonardis contributed reporting.

sport Deep in Winter, Let’s Discuss the Stifling of Starting Pitchers - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Baseball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Baseball|Deep in Winter, Let’s Discuss the Stifling of Starting Pitchers Supported by Sports of The Times Deep in Winter, Let’s Discuss the Stifling of Starting Pitchers Image The Mets’ Noah Syndergaard might benefit from pushing later into games.CreditCreditAdam Hunger/Getty Images By Michael Powell Jan. 4, 2019 Can we talk starting pitchers or, more to the point, their ritual sacrifice on the altar of Major League Baseball analytics? I put this question to Leo Mazzone, the former pitching coach for the Atlanta Braves and the custodian of one of baseball’s greatest rotations of starting pitchers: Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine, Hall of Famers all. The 2018 playoffs and World Series offered a parade of twitchy managers yanking their starting pitchers after four innings, summoning a parade of faceless relievers to throw one mind-numbing fastball after another for fractions of an inning. This is spectacular for the radar gun industry, but is it watchable and good baseball? I heard Mazzone snorting on the other end of the phone line, no, no and no. “It is an embarrassment and insults the intelligence,” he said. “They are abusing pitchers and calling it smart.” Mazzone imparted this gospel to his pitchers: Trying to heave balls as fast as you can is for muscle-beach dolts. A good pitcher throws at 85 to 90 percent of effort and makes the pitch move and hit its location. Varies speeds, too. As for the notion a pitcher can last but five or six innings before batters grow wise and clobber him? Please. “A high school coach asked me, ‘Leo what do you think of analytics showing that pitchers struggle the third time through a lineup?’ I’ll tell you want that is, that’s the manager covering his (you know what),” he said. The equation guys who run most major league teams bow to holy verities: No starting pitcher should throw more than 100 pitches. Some starters should not throw as many as 70. To admire the number of wins a pitcher accumulates or to encourage him to toss a complete game is to expose yourself as a Paleolithic hunter-gatherer. Pitching is all about WHIP and FIP (I’d explain the definitions, but then our heads would hurt) and a conga line of relief pitchers. Image Leo Mazzone, center, was the pitching czar for the Atlanta Braves when they had one of the greatest starting rotations in history.CreditCraig Melvin/Getty Images Look, on a good day I don’t drag my knuckles along the sidewalks of Flatbush, Brooklyn. I dig sabermetrics and back in the day treated Bill James annuals as religious text. I keep a three-foot-high stack of the analytics-obsessed Baseball Prospectus at home. But at risk of registering as a get-off-my-lawn crank: So much of the wisdom about pitchers is dubious. I set to thinking about this after watching my Mets spend much of November and December in a modestly lunatic attempt to trade Noah Syndergaard, one of the National League’s best starting pitchers. They appear to have failed at this self-mutilation. Now that they have retained two true aces — Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom, the Cy Young Award winner — why not stretch them out and push them to go deeper into games? What is the point in allowing an ace to pitch six innings before turning the ball over to a committee of anonymous relievers? Game 4 of the 2018 World Series presented something of a nadir when Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, a bright fellow no doubt, pulled his starting pitcher after he had yielded a single hit through six and a third innings and was ahead, 4-0. The Dodgers ended up marching six relievers into that game, lost, 9-6, and exited the World Series the next day. Mazzone pulled out a few of his remaining hairs. “The greatest teacher for a pitcher is starts,” he says. “Pitch and pitch and pitch. Let a pitcher find himself. “The problem is that so many pitching coaches and managers are yes-men and don’t want to challenge their front offices.” There’s a sizable mound of statistical evidence to back such assertions. At risk of giving the quadratic dudes a seizure, I turned to Baseball Reference and selected 40 pitchers from the past half-century, men who ran the gamut from solid to superb. These are the sort of pitchers you’d expect to see in the postseason, and my list included Bobby Ojeda, Mike Torrez, Steve Avery, Tom Browning, Tom Seaver, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins and Mazzone’s troika of Hall of Famers. I examined their performances across games, from beginning to end. For most good pitchers, their worst inning was the first. Once they found a rhythm and once pitches began to crackle, they became progressively more difficult to hit. Tom Seaver’s career earned run average in the first inning was 3.75. His E.R.A. for the last three innings of a game, that dreaded third and fourth time through the batting order, stood at 2.75. Image Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts pulled starter Rich Hill off the mound with one out in the seventh inning of World Series Game 4, even though Hill held a 4-0 lead and had allowed just one hit.CreditDavid J. Phillip/Associated Press So current analytic wisdom does a headstand. (By way of insane outlier, Seaver won 25 games in 1969 and helped pitch the Miracle Mets to a World Series championship. He pitched the ninth inning 17 times that season and surrendered not a single run.) This is a familiar pattern. Mike Mussina gave up fewer runs on average in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings than he did in the first three. He was at his best in the ninth inning. The best inning for Ron Darling and David Wells was the eighth. (Requisite caveat: By definition, these pitchers were having a good outing if they made it to the late innings.) If you hoped to beat Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, you were advised to start hacking early. He had a career E.R.A. of 4.25 in the first inning. When Valenzuela was still pitching in the ninth inning, and he got there roughly 127 times in his career, his E.R.A. was 2.19. Luis Tiant, the Red Sox and Cleveland ace, was nearly as tough. He pitched just over 206 times in the ninth inning and had an E.R.A. of 2.40. Greg Maddux had a 3.23 E.R.A. in his first three innings and a 2.86 from the seventh inning through the ninth. And while he possessed a good fastball, it was not a three-digit express train. One spring training in the mid-1990s, Maddux, who in a 23-year career piled up 355 fairly meaningful wins, asked to speak with the team’s young pitchers. Mazzone nodded. Sure thing, Mad Dog, whatever you want. The coach lined up the young guys and Maddux walked over. “You know why I am a millionaire? Because I can put my fastball wherever I want to,” Maddux told them. “Do you know why I own beachfront property in L.A.? Because I can change speeds. O.K., questions?” Image The Atlanta Braves greats — from left, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Greg Maddux — operated with minimal attention to pitch counts.CreditDoug Mills/Associated Press Mazzone was not enraptured by pitch counts. He would not push pitchers to stupid extremes, but he refused to hew to limits without basis in medical fact. He had pitchers run and throw every day in between starts, and they had remarkably few injuries. In one three-year stretch, his pitchers missed a single start. “We kept track of pitches and I had a clicker,” he said, “but if Tommy Glavine gets a pop-up on a changeup, hell, I’m not counting that.” He recalled a Braves vice president by the name of Henry Aaron who offered advice about the dangers of radar gun intoxication. “Don’t worry about pure speed,” Aaron said. “You can run a jet airliner through the strike zone, and I will figure out how to rope it down the line. Locate a ball that moves at my knees, and I’m out.” All of which brings me back to the Mets, a team I’ve followed for many, often hapless, decades. Their manager, Mickey Callaway, sounds as enamored of pitch counts as his peers are. All of this seeps into the brainpans of young pitchers who labor under the impression that five or six innings constitute a day’s work. Syndergaard is a fine pitcher and susceptible to the idiocies of the age. A year ago he pumped iron in the off-season in hopes of throwing even harder than 100 miles per hour, and that season he blew a muscle in his side. He appears to accept the notion that pitching through the seventh inning lies beyond the limit of human exertion, and last season he posted a 7.88 E.R.A. in that inning. His rotation mates are no different. On the rare occasions they pitched into the seventh inning, Zack Wheeler and Steven Matz posted calamitous E.R.A.s of 5.65 and 6.35. Mazzone went to Cooperstown in 2014 for the Hall of Fame inductions of Maddux and Glavine. They got to yakking before the ceremony, and Mazzone asked what they would have done if, in the course of pitching a World Series shutout, he had come to the mound to pull them from the game. Glavine looked at him, smiled thinly and replied, “Mazz, we were going to have a fight on that mound.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: A Modest Proposal: Let Starters Pitch.

sport A Quarterback Will Win the Heisman. But Which One? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|A Quarterback Will Win the Heisman. But Which One? Supported by A Quarterback Will Win the Heisman. But Which One? Image Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray, Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa and Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins, all quarterbacks, were invited to this year’s Heisman Trophy ceremony as the finalists.CreditCreditUSA Today Sports, via Reuters By Marc Tracy Dec. 7, 2018 For the past several years, the Heisman Trophy race has not been particularly close in its final week. Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield was considered a certain winner last year, much as Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson was the year before. This year is different. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, a sophomore and the front-runner for much of the season, has slipped to second place behind Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray, a redshirt junior, if the Bovada betting odds are to be believed. Two factors make this such a confounding guessing game. One is that these two generally similar players have some statistics that are strikingly disparate. Oklahoma’s offense — the same Air Raid variant that saw Mayfield win last year under Coach Lincoln Riley — had Murray throwing early and often, while the Alabama offense still relied heavily on the run, as is the tradition for Nick Saban-coached teams. (The dominant Crimson Tide also sat Tagovailoa during many fourth quarters.) As a result, Murray threw for 700 more yards than Tagovailoa, although he also did it on 46 more attempts. Indeed, Murray averaged just 0.5 yards more per attempt than Tagovailoa, and their yards-per-attempt figures topped the Football Bowl Subdivision. The other fly in the ointment is what happened last weekend. Murray turned in another spectacular game — 379 yards, three touchdowns — in the high-stakes Big 12 championship game versus Texas. Tagovailoa, limited by an injury on the first drive of the Southeastern Conference title game against Georgia, threw two interceptions (the same number he had thrown over the prior 12 games) and left in the fourth quarter with Alabama trailing by 7 points, only to watch his backup, Jalen Hurts, lead the Tide to victory. Tagovailoa underwent ankle surgery last Sunday and is expected back in a couple of weeks, in time for the college playoff games. So how will voters make sense of that late turn of events, which came in the final weekend of balloting? We will find out Saturday night. One thing we do know is that the winner will be a quarterback — the 16th signal-caller to be honored in the last 19 seasons. That is because the third finalist, Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins, a sophomore, is also a quarterback (one whose season should stand out more than it has against these two other talents). It is the first time that all the Heisman finalists are quarterbacks of color. If Murray wins, he will likely be the first Heisman winner to go on to play a different sport professionally since Florida State’s Charlie Ward won in 1993 and then entered the N.B.A. Murray was drafted by the Oakland Athletics and has said his plan is to report to spring training next February. Here is a look at the three top candidates. Image CreditSue Ogrocki/Associated Press Kyler Murray, Oklahoma His case by the numbers: Murray led the F.B.S. in yards per attempt (11.9) and ESPN’s passer efficiency rating. He was second in completion percentage (70.9 percent) and in passing touchdowns (40), adding 11 on the ground. He had a brilliant 65-yard run on the first drive of Oklahoma’s penultimate game versus West Virginia. The Sooners went 12-1, again, and won the Big 12, again, and will go to the playoff, again. Scouting report: Could those “agains” hurt Murray’s case? This is very similar to what Mayfield did at Oklahoma a year ago. Of course, Mayfield went on to be the No. 1 overall draft pick and is now starting in the N.F.L. But one could foresee some voters arguing that Murray merely thrived in a system designed to boost quarterback statistics. Do not believe it, though. When you stop for a moment and consider where Oklahoma, with its 108th-ranked defense, would have been this year with a merely good quarterback, Murray’s case as college football’s exemplary player this season becomes much clearer. Image CreditButch Dill/Associated Press Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama His case by the numbers: Second in passer efficiency and yards per attempt. Third in touchdowns — he threw 37 touchdown passes against four interceptions, which is the kind of thing Tom Brady does. Although his Alabama coaches likely lived in constant fear that he would get injured, he still managed five touchdowns on the ground. Other important numbers are 13 and 0 — as in, Alabama went 13-0. Scouting report: Remember last season’s national title game and the 41-yard vertical pass Tagovailoa hurled to end it in Alabama’s favor? He has been doing that same play all season, deep vertical routes to speedy receivers that blow games open for the Tide. It has produced exceptionally exciting offense at a program and for a coach not known for it. Tagovailoa would become the first Alabama quarterback and the first Nick Saban quarterback to win the Heisman. That speaks a lot to his distinctiveness. And Hurts’s ability to defeat Georgia last Saturday ought not diminish Tagovailoa’s achievement, as Hurts is no slouch, what with the two national championship games he led Alabama to in 2016 and 2017. Image CreditJay Laprete/Associated Press Dwayne Haskins, Ohio State His case by the numbers: By far the most touchdowns in the F.B.S., with 47 (next is Murray, with 40), and that is not counting four more on the ground. One of just six eligible quarterbacks with a completion rate above 70 percent. Like Oklahoma, Ohio State went 12-1 and won its conference. Haskins’s signature game came in the season’s most important, the 62-39 win over Michigan — against whose fantastic defense Haskins threw for 396 yards, 6 touchdowns and no interceptions. Scouting report: It is surprising that Haskins is not more central to the Heisman conversation. While quarterbacks in the offenses of departing Ohio State coach Urban Meyer often thrive — see: Alex Smith, Tim Tebow, J.T. Barrett — none did so while running the ball as infrequently as Haskins did. So why did he never truly catch on in the Heisman race? Ohio State had a bad loss, at Purdue, though Haskins’s worst game came later, versus Nebraska. More broadly, he arguably peaked too late in the season, throwing for 11 touchdowns in his final two games. With quarterbacks coach Ryan Day ascending to Ohio State’s top job and Haskins still having two more years of collegiate eligibility, here is something else that would be surprising: if Haskins is not back in Manhattan one of the next two Decembers.

Tway, who won the season-opening Safeway Open in October for his first PGA Tour victory and a berth in the winners-only Tournament of Champions, carded five birdies in making the turn in 31 shots. He then rolled in two more birdies on the back nine to complete a bogey-free card in windy conditions on the par-73 Plantation Course at Kapalua Resort. The defending champion Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas and Gary Woodland were one shot back after shooting 67s on Thursday. Johnson was 4-under on the course’s par-5s, with the only blemish on his scorecard a bogey on No. 6 that came after he had driven the ball into the thick grass and had to chop the ball out. Marc Leishman was alone in fifth place at 5-under. Another shot back was a group of players that included Jason Day, Rory McIlroy — who is playing the event for the first time — Bryson DeChambeau, Andrew Landry, Patton Kizzire and Andrew Putnam. DeChambeau was one of the stories of the day, taking advantage of a new rule that allows players to keep the pin in the hole while on the putting surface. DeChambeau opted to on numerous holes. Tway is the son of the eight-time PGA Tour winner Bob Tway and recalled the Plantation Course from helping his father prepare for the 2004 event. And he needed all the knowledge he could get after pulling out of Wednesday’s pro-am after only a few holes because of an ear and sinus infection. “When you’re making a lot of birdies it makes everything better,” Tway said after Thursday’s round. “I was just trying to drink a lot of water. But I didn’t think I was going to play that good, to be honest.” He added: “I hit the ball well, kept the ball in play, made a few putts, controlled my ball in the wind. “It’s windy where I’m from in Oklahoma, so it’s kind of like I was at home. Each shot’s difficult so you’re just focused on the trajectory and where I need to land it and where I need to miss it.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: At Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, American Eyes a 2nd Win of the Season.

sport Bucks blast infamous 'Kawhi laugh' over loud speaker after Raptors turnover Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Bucks expertly blast infamous 'Kawhi laugh' over loudspeaker after Raptors turnover Kyle CantlonYahoo Canada SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 3:46 AM GMT For the second outing in a row, Kawhi Leonard was punked by everyone not on the floor. Earlier on this week in his first game back in San Antonio since the mid-summer trade that landed him in Toronto, Kawhi was booed relentlessly every time he touched the ball from pre-game warmups on. The roars were extra potent during player introductions before the contest, and Leonard was even showered with chants of “traitor” when he stepped to the free throw line. Scroll to continue with content Ad During the Raptors clash in Milwaukee against the East-leading Bucks on Saturday, Leonard was treated to a slightly less hostile troll job, this time via the Bucks game-day operations staff, who should be given across-the-board raises immediately. Hold on a damn second. The Raptors just committed a back court violation and then this is played over the PA system I RECOGNIZE THAT LAUGH pic.twitter.com/lXYpOWOFDa — Rob Perez (@WorldWideWob) January 6, 2019 That’s right, in a perfectly-executed stunt by the PA people in Milwaukee, the now infamous “Kawhi Laugh” was blasted over the loud speakers of the Fiserv Forum when the Raptors committed a turnover near the tale end of opening quarter. Incase you’ve not yet had the pleasure, THIS is the legendary giggle we’re talking about. The Bucks game-day crew was in peak form on Saturday. (Screengrab/Youtube) As far as I can tell, tonight is the first time the laugh has been used as an in-game trolling mechanism against the Raptors. The Minnesota Timberwolves PA person attempted a similar stunt during a T-Wolves-Lakers game early this season, but it just doesn’t have the same effect without the man of the hour on the floor to soak it all in. Story continues It’s apparent that Kawhi’s laugh, which was possibly the soundtrack of 2018, won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. Definitely cool with that.

sport Deal to Give Cuban Players Easy Path to M.L.B.

Meets Government Resistance Supported by Deal to Give Cuban Players Easy Path to M.L.B. Meets Government Resistance Image Yasiel Puig is among dozens of Cuban players who have made it big in the major leagues.CreditCreditMonica Almeida for The New York Times By David Waldstein and Katie Rogers Dec. 19, 2018 Major League Baseball, in conjunction with the players’ union, on Wednesday announced an agreement with the Cuban baseball federation to legalize and streamline the transfer of professional baseball players to the United States and Canada — but the move immediately met resistance from the Trump administration. The agreement is intended to bring order to the often chaotic path, fraught with human trafficking, by which Cuban players have landed in the major leagues in recent decades. But within hours of the announcement, the Trump administration had attacked the deal, essentially threatening to scuttle it before it could be put in place. The White House said in a statement that it would continue to work to restrict the Cuban regime’s ability to profit from United States businesses. It also indicated that the plan would create another human rights issue — one carried out by the Cuban government rather than traffickers. Many current stars made their way out of Cuba previously, like Yoenis Cespedes of the Mets, Aroldis Chapman of the Yankees, Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox and Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers. They followed the path of players like Rene Arocha; Orlando Hernandez, who is known as El Duque; Livan Hernandez; and Rey Ordonez, the former Met who jumped over a wall to escape the Cuban national team during an international competition in 1993. “For years, Major League Baseball has been seeking to end the trafficking of baseball players from Cuba by criminal organizations by creating a safe and legal alternative for those players to sign with Major League clubs,” Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, said in a statement. “We believe that this agreement accomplishes that objective and will allow the next generation of Cuban players to pursue their dream without enduring many of the hardships experienced by current and former Cuban players who have played Major League Baseball.” The three-year deal would create a posting system similar to how players from Japan and South Korea join the major leagues. According to the agreement, the Cuban baseball federation would free its players to sign with Major League Baseball teams. The players would automatically qualify for a United States work visa and would also have the right to take family members with them and return to Cuba at will. The deal calls for the Cuban baseball federation to release a player who has accumulated either six years of service time in Cuba or who is at least 25 years old. In exchange, the Cuban federation would receive 25 percent of a player’s signing bonus for a minor league player; for a major league player, the payment would be based on a formula that assesses 15 percent to 25 percent of the signing bonus. Dan Halem, M.L.B.’s deputy commissioner and chief legal officer, took the lead in negotiations with the Cubans and was joined in the last two days by Manfred as baseball sought approval for the agreement from various branches of the United States government. M.L.B.’s legislative affairs committee, which includes the Yankees’ team president, Randy Levine, also participated in those negotiations. The deal would give scouts access to watch Cuban players at organized showcases. The Cuban Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Cuban ambassador, José Ramón Cabañas, seemed to express government support for the deal on Twitter. Antonio Castro, the youngest son of Fidel Castro, who died in 2016, is the vice president of the Cuban baseball federation and has talked of the sport as an instrument to forge better relations with the United States. Still, for decades, the Cuban government prohibited its players from joining the major leagues, leaving dozens of ambitious players to seek other means to sign with teams. That often led to the players’ being smuggled out in dangerous journeys by sea on speedboats, often at the mercy of human traffickers, smugglers and others looking to earn hefty profits. Many additional talented players, who could have made millions in the United States, stayed at home to play for meager wages. Abreu is one of several players with harrowing tales of escape from Cuba, forced estrangement from families left behind and harassment from traffickers even after they arrived in the United States. “Dealing with the exploitation of smugglers and unscrupulous agencies will finally come to an end for the Cuban baseball player,” Abreu said in a statement released by M.L.B. and the players’ union. “To this date, I am still harassed.” M.L.B. and the Cuban baseball federation have been in talks ever since the United States and Cuba began a thaw in relations under the Obama administration in 2014. Soon after that, baseball’s commissioner’s office secured a license from the Treasury Department to legally commence negotiations with the Cubans. On March 22, 2016, the Tampa Bay Rays played an exhibition game in Havana, attended by President Barack Obama during his visit there, with the long-term goal of encouraging an agreement on the free movement of players. But normalization of relations between the countries has slowed under the Trump administration, and some current administration officials have expressed reservations to M.L.B. and the players’ association about doing business with Cuban entities while a trade embargo, enacted more than 50 years ago during the Cold War, remains in place. While the Trump administration bristled at the plan, an M.L.B. official noted that in a National Security Presidential Memorandum from June 2017, the government indicated it did not want to affect any existing approvals with Cuba; M.L.B. was granted approval the previous year. One of the hurdles has been the restriction on money going into Cuba. The policy of the American government has been to allow financial support for everyday Cubans while keeping dollars out of the hands of the Cuban government or military. Another possible sticking point: The Cuban federation, which is required under Olympic rules to be independent of the central government, can still prevent younger players from leaving Cuba before they reach their 25th birthday or have six years of service time. That would leave those players vulnerable to the dangers of human trafficking if they sought to defect. This has complicated negotiations between M.L.B. and the Cubans. In the posting agreement with Asian countries, younger players are also prevented from joining M.L.B. teams, but they do not live under authoritarian governments, and M.L.B. was wary of entering into an agreement that would still trap young players who did not want to stay in Cuba. To address the issue, the deal includes a one- or two-year waiting period for those players once they leave Cuba. If the Cuban federation does not release a younger player and he still leaves on his own, he would not be able to collect any money from M.L.B. for a year or two, depending on when he leaves. The aim is to discourage human traffickers who would not want to wait that long to be paid. But through the transfer of funds, M.L.B. hopes to provide the incentive for the Cuban federation to release younger players. There were 25 players born in Cuba playing in the major leagues in 2018. It is thought that most of the best current players from Cuba are already in the major leagues. But the new agreement could help teams uncover and develop other prospects, and could also deter marginal players from leaving their Cuban teams in the hopes of reaching the majors before they are ready. Some who have defected were never signed and reside in other Caribbean nations, waiting for a chance.

The Nets won, 112-104.CreditCreditMary Altaffer/Associated Press By The Associated Press Dec. 8, 2018 Spencer Dinwiddie scored 25 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 20, leading the Nets to a 112-104 victory over the Knicks on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. Allen Crabbe scored 17 points, Jarrett Allen had 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Joe Harris added 11 as the Nets won their second straight game, improving to 10-18. Enes Kanter led the Knicks (8-19) with 23 points and 14 rebounds. Allonzo Trier had 15 points off the bench, Emmanuel Mudiay chipped in with 13 points, and Damyean Dotson and Mario Hezonja each added 12 for the Knicks, who have lost three straight and five of six. “My Sunday will be a heck of a lot better,” the Nets’ Kenny Atkinson said. “We call it a Q of L win. Quality of life win. We feel a little bit better and everything tastes a little better.” The Nets were coming off an emotional overtime win over Toronto on Friday, while the Knicks had not played since Thursday. In this game, it was the Nets who were the better, more in-sync squad. “I just love the spirit of this group,” Atkinson said. “A great win against Toronto. Beating the Knicks on the road. It’s a great job by our guys.” They used crisp passing to create open shots when they were not driving the lane for layups and drawing fouls. The team made 48.9 percent of its shots from the field (43 for 88) and 50 percent of its 3-pointers (11 for 22). The Knicks, meanwhile, knocked down 47 percent of their shots (39 for 83) but missed 18 of 26 from 3-point range (30.8 percent). Each team shot 60 percent from the free-throw line. The Nets made 15 of 25 from the line; the Knicks were 18 for 30. The Nets led by 10 points, 56-46, at halftime and extended their lead to as many as 19 points in the fourth quarter. “I was searching that whole game for a lineup that could compete defensively and move the ball offensively,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. “We were in mud for two and a half or three quarters of that game.” This season, the Nets have not show the ability to close out opponents, while the Knicks have fought back from deficits. Both happened in the fourth quarter, as the Knicks cut the deficit to 5 points, 101-96, on a layup by Frank Ntilikina. But on the Knicks’ next possession, Dotson missed a driving reverse layup, and on the counterattack Hollis-Jefferson was awarded a basket as Mitchell Robinson was called for defensive goaltending. Immediately after that sequence, Ntilikina missed a 3, and Crabbe countered with a basket from behind the arc that pushed the advantage to 10 points, 106-96. Still, the Knicks hung in. After Dinwiddie dropped in a layup that extended the Nets’ lead to 110-98 with 2 minutes 16 seconds left, the Knicks scored the next 6 points and closed the deficit to 110-104. Dinwiddie’s driving dunk following a timeout put the game away. CELTICS 133, BULLS 77 Jaylen Brown scored 23 points off the bench, Daniel Theis added a career-high 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and the visiting Boston Celtics routed the Chicago Bulls, 133-77, for their fifth straight win. The 56-point margin of victory was the largest in Celtics franchise history, surpassing a 51-point win (153-102) over the Philadelphia Warriors on March 7, 1962.

sport 8 teams that could ruin Alabama-Clemson V next season Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Which teams could break up another Alabama-Clemson title game next season? Pat FordeYahoo SportsJanuary 7, 2019, 12:48 AM GMT SAN JOSE, Calif. — For those who loathe the reality of Alabama-Clemson IV, there can be only one thing worse: The looming threat of Alabama-Clemson V. Scroll to continue with content Ad A year from now, there is a great chance that the Crimson Tide and Tigers are facing off again in the College Football Playoff, with the winner taking another national championship. There is no sign that either head coach is going anywhere. Their brilliant quarterbacks both will be back. Clemson’s leading rusher and top three receivers in terms of yardage all return. So will Alabama’s entire quarter of big-play receivers, plus its No. 2 rusher. Both teams will have some significant holes to fill defensively and on the offensive line, but have you seen the way they’ve recruited? So, yeah. The two-program domination of college football appears quite likely to continue. Unless someone can break the stranglehold. But who? Alabama head coach Nick Saban and Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney pose with the trophy at a news conference for the NCAA college football playoff championship game Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019, in Santa Clara, Calif. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) There are eight candidates for that dirty job. None may be able to do it. But for a jealous nation steeped in bitterness over the lack of diversity at the top of the sport, these are your best hopes for a breakthrough: Georgia Bulldogs The team that has played Alabama better than anyone for two straight seasons brings back two-year starting quarterback Jake Fromm, leading rusher D’Andre Swift and a punishing offensive line. A top-15 defense was largely manned by underclassmen. And Kirby Smart’s 2019 recruiting class should be his third straight ranked in the top three nationally by Rivals.com, as the talent piles up in Athens. The schedule: It will be harder than it was in 2018. Notre Dame comes back on the slate, as does Texas A&M. The good news for the Bulldogs is that both those games will be between the hedges, as will matchups with Kentucky and Missouri. Toughest road game: at Auburn on Nov. 16. Story continues The problem: Georgia has had at least one game the past two seasons where everything goes to hell (Auburn in 2017, LSU in 2018, most of the game against Texas in the Sugar Bowl). That’s a trait the Bulldogs need to purge, along with Smart’s penchant for disastrous fake kicks. Oklahoma Sooners Yes, the Sooners are replacing a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback. How did that turn out last time? Pretty well, when Kyler Murray somehow topped Baker Mayfield’s magic. Next in the Lincoln Riley pipeline is Austin Kendall, highly regarded in his own right. He will have two backs who combined to rush for 2,000 yards to work with, in addition to 1,100-yard receiver CeeDee Lamb. Oklahoma’s defense was dreadful, but also very young — look for significant improvement with more experience and the arrival of coordinator Alex Grinch. The schedule: Non-conference play opens with Houston in Norman, and if Cougars quarterback D’Eriq King is back from a November knee injury, that will at least present a challenge. There also is a trip to UCLA, which figures to be improved in its second year under Chip Kelly. Since nobody has run the table in the Big 12 since it went to nine league games, there could be an ambush somewhere — most likely in Dallas. The problem: The defensive makeover would have to be massive to beat either Tua Tagovailoa or Trevor Lawrence. And Kendall will have a lot on his shoulders replacing back-to-back Heisman winners. Texas Longhorns The Longhorns take a lot of momentum into the offseason after whipping Georgia in the Sugar Bowl and appearing in the Big 12 title game. Quarterback Sam Ehlinger keeps getting better, looking more like Tim Tebow with each physical run and clutch pass. Receiver Collin Johnson’s decision to return to school was big — and if he’s joined by fellow junior Lil’Jordan Humphrey it would be huge. There will be some rebuilding to do on a defense that started eight seniors in the Sugar Bowl. The schedule: There is a huge yardstick game Sept. 7, when LSU visits Austin. But after what’s happened the last two seasons against Maryland, the Longhorns will have to be ready for the opener against a Louisiana Tech program that is usually competitive. The problem: Texas won 10 games in 2018, but was hardly a dominant team. Almost every game was decided by one score, and the Longhorns actually gave up more yards per play (5.61) than they gained (5.51). It’s a big leap up to taking down Alabama or Clemson. Will Tom Herman (L) and Texas break through and challenge Alabama and Clemson next season? (AP) Ohio State Buckeyes We’ll see how Ryan Day does replacing a legendary winner in Urban Meyer, but he at least starts from a position of strength in terms of available talent. Assuming Dwayne Haskins goes pro, the eligibility of transfer quarterback Justin Fields becomes paramount. J.K. Dobbins has rushed for nearly 2,500 yards in two seasons, and a deep receiving corps should continue to be well-manned even with several departures. A defense that was young and vulnerable in 2018 should get better in ’19, led by monster rush end Chase Young. There is always ample talent in Columbus. The schedule: There are no Power Five opponents in the non-conference slate, which could be a problem — but Cincinnati of the American Athletic Conference is no slouch, coming off an 11-win season. Ohio State plays both of the best programs from the Big Ten West on consecutive weeks in October — first Northwestern, then Wisconsin. And the regular season ends with a wallop: Penn State on Nov. 23 and at Michigan on Nov. 30. The problem: Does the quarterback production slide without Haskins? Does the preparedness and motivation slide without Meyer? Those are two big unknowns. Michigan Wolverines Even with three early entries in the NFL draft on defense, the Wolverines return a lot of parts from a 10-win team. Quarterback Shea Patterson, his top two receivers and basically the entire offensive line are back. While the defensive losses are appreciable, there are several returning impact players. The 2017 recruiting class, which ranked fourth nationally, should be fully integrated into the ’19 on-field product. The schedule: The biggest games are at home. Notre Dame comes into the Big House on Oct. 26, with two road games immediately preceding that meeting and one immediately after. The season ends with nemesis Ohio State coming to Ann Arbor. The problem: The Wolverines still have to show they can close the gap on Ohio State before worrying about closing the chasm between them and Clemson/Alabama. Notre Dame Fighting Irish The Fighting Irish start with quarterback Ian Book operating behind a line that returns most of its key parts. There is depth at receiver and running back to keep the offense rolling. A lot of playmakers depart from the Irish defense, most notably All-American cornerback Julian Love, but several also remain. Super reliable kicker Justin Yoon must be replaced. The schedule: For everyone who whined about Notre Dame not playing anybody in 2018, that argument disappears in ’19. The Irish visit Georgia, Michigan and what should be an improved Stanford team, with home games against USC and Virginia Tech (both of which also should be improved). The problem: A good Notre Dame team lost to Clemson by 27 this year. That’s a lot of ground to make up. Stanford Cardinal Quarterback K.J. Costello returns after carrying the Cardinal with his arm this season. Stanford would probably like to get back to more of a run-based offense, and that could be possible despite the loss of its top two running backs. An offensive line hit hard by injuries in 2018 should be better in ’19. Defensively, there will be holes to fill and improvements to make. The schedule: Stanford had better be ready early, because it opens with Northwestern, USC and Central Florida. Notre Dame visits at the end. The problem: Can the Pac-12 produce anyone good enough to beat the best? Oregon Ducks When QB Justin Herbert surprisingly announced his return to school, that elevated the Ducks’ chances for 2019. The loss of leading receiver Dillon Mitchell to the draft hurts, but virtually every other major skill-position contributor is expected back. The offensive line that started the Redbox Bowl included no seniors. Oregon was young defensively as well, and it adds instant-impact recruit Kayvon Thibodeaux. The schedule: The Ducks get an opener that could make or break playoff hopes, taking on Auburn in Arlington, Texas. A win there would go a long way. There are challenging road games at Stanford, Washington and USC. The problem: See above. Can the Pac-12 close the gap that has opened up between its best teams and the very best in the nation?

sport The legend of Nick Foles grows bigger in Chicago Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Nick Foles refuses to let his Philadelphia story end Kevin KadukYahoo SportsJanuary 7, 2019, 4:56 AM GMT CHICAGO — Nick Foles says he knows there will be a time when his unlikely ride with the Philadelphia Eagles finally comes to an end and he’s forced to take his kelly green jersey off one last time. Pardon the rest of us if we say we’re not so sure. Scroll to continue with content Ad The reigning Super Bowl champion quarterback is kryptonite to the offseason set of golf clubs; the antidote to locker cleanout day. The Eagles’ future still belongs to Carson Wentz, sure, but the past and present continue to be dominated by a backup quarterback writing a legend that Wentz will be hard pressed to match. Glance at the stat sheet from Sunday’s 16-15 NFC wild-card win over the Chicago Bears and you might not walk away that impressed. It was the least of Foles’ four playoff performances from a numbers standpoint: 25-of-40 passing for 266 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. His quarterback rating of 77.7 — while a great number for a Vegas slot machine — was his first playoff rating that failed to hit triple digits. Nick Foles was great when it mattered most, a theme for the Eagles quarterback. (AP) And yet when you consider Foles’ entire day — bouncing back from two first-half turnovers, leading bookend touchdown drives in the second half and playing in a road atmosphere he called the most hostile of his career, all while playing with a couple of bruised ribs — it will go down as a sneaky underrated game on his Eagles resume. “It wasn’t pretty at times,” Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said when asked about Foles. “But he hung in there and did some good things.” The good things came against a Bears defense that was rated tops in the league and had humbled nearly every quarterback it faced in its breakout season. Story continues Foles, who took back over from an injured Wentz in Week 15, opened the game by leading the Eagles on a drive that ended with a field goal. Those three points were big and not just because of Cody Parkey’s inability to collect three of his own at the end of the game. The Bears came into the game having allowed a total of 10 first-quarter points over its previous 10 games. The rest of the first half was much more of a struggle with Foles throwing two picks, including one in the end zone. But an Eagles defense that was up to the task kept the team in the game and Foles said he fed off the support. “The game wasn’t going great in the first half offensively,” Foles said. “But our defense was keeping us in it and they just kept coming to the sidelines [saying] ‘We got you, we got you, we’re going to get you the ball back.’ They never turn, they never got upset. They just had our back.” Foles’ first drive of the second half was a seven-play, 83-yard drive that took advantage of three Bears penalties and ended with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Dallas Goedert that gave the Eagles a 10-6 lead. The Bears reclaimed the lead with a Parkey field goal and a touchdown drive of their own, but the Eagles got the ball back at their own 40 with 3:47 left. Because “Nick is Nick” (a truism repeated at least a few times by at least a few teammates after the game), everyone in the Eagles locker room said they knew what was coming. “We knew we didn’t have to get that crazy,” tight end Zach Ertz said. “We knew we could just eat up yards and march down the field.” And the Eagles did. Foles hooked up on chunk-eating receptions with Goedert, Ertz and ex-Bears wideout Alshon Jeffery to get down to the Bears’ 2-yard-line. After three failed plays, Foles found Golden Tate sprinting and straddling the goal line for what would end up being the difference in the game. Eagles wide receiver Golden Tate had the winning score, a 2-yard touchdown reception with 56 seconds left. (AP) Next up for Foles and the Eagles is a Sunday trip to New Orleans and a date with another Austin (Texas) Westlake High quarterbacking product: Saints quarterback Drew Brees. The Eagles were blown out there 48-7 on Nov. 18 and will be a decided underdog like they were against the Bears. Foles didn’t play in that first Saints game. And since he seems able to keep negotiating with his non-negotiable exit date in Philly, should any of us be surprised if the Eagles go down and win there too? Whatever the case, Foles said he’s aware his magical time with Philadelphia is coming to an end, whether it’s next week or after another Super Bowl, this time in Atlanta. As such, he said he tried to take a moment in the crowded and victorious visitors locker room to appreciate the ride that refuses to end. “I’m blessed to be able to wear this jersey at least one more week,” Foles said. “I get to play with these guys one more week. I get to be with the coaches one more week. That’s something I really look forward to.” More from Yahoo Sports: • Robinson: Keeping Jason Garrett paid off for Jerry Jones • Warriors-Kings combine to set history for most 3-pointers in NBA game • 19-year-old Cal DB dies after collapsing during workout • Deshaun Watson’s streak ends in loss to Colts What to Read Next Back Sign in Sports Home Fantasy NFL NBA MLB NHL NCAAF Soccer Golf NCAAB MMA World Cup Boxing NASCAR Tennis WNBA NCAAW Indycar Horse Racing Cycling Odds Videos Podcasts Rivals Shop Help Jobs Yahoo Sites Home Mail Search News Finance Entertainment Lifestyle Sports Fantasy Sports Weather Tech Shopping Answers Tumblr Tools Help Account Info Careers About Terms (Updated) & Privacy (Updated)

That’s the Problem. Supported by On Soccer Manchester United Thrives Off the Field. That’s the Problem. Image Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will try to steady Manchester United’s sinking ship.CreditCreditLindsey Parnaby/EPA, via Shutterstock By Rory Smith Dec. 21, 2018 MANCHESTER, England — Inside Old Trafford, 75,572 fans stood at attention. On the field, Manchester United’s players gathered in a huddle, fresh from victory against Swansea City, arms draped around each other’s shoulders. In the center circle, Alex Ferguson shuffled from foot to foot. He was about to say goodbye to the club he had managed for 27 years. This had been his final home game, his final league title, his final triumph. He had “no script” for the speech he was about to give. As Ferguson planned what he was going to say, Alan Keegan, United’s longstanding stadium announcer, had the microphone. He called Old Trafford to order. He listed Ferguson’s achievements, though everyone in attendance knew them by rote. He described the club the Scot had built: “rulers of English football, the most revered club in the land.” “We have history at our mercy, and our destiny is firmly in our own hands,” Keegan said. Finally, the rain pouring down, soaking him through, Ferguson spoke. He thanked the fans, the club, the staff. He informed the crowd that their “job is now to stand by your new manager.” He offered a final instruction to the players, too. “Don’t ever let yourselves down,” he said. “The expectation is always there.” That was May 2013. Old Trafford was that sort of place then, the center of English soccer’s greatest empire. Ferguson’s power was absolute. A few days previously, he had summoned David Moyes, his handpicked replacement, to his home. He had not asked him if he wanted the job. He just told him he had it. His wish was his command. He spoke, and the fans and the players listened. It felt like the sun would never set. Not yet six years on, English soccer’s landscape has undergone an almost unimaginable shift. When Manchester United meets Cardiff City on Saturday, those fans’ job is to get behind their fifth manager since Ferguson’s departure; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a much-loved former player, has been appointed as caretaker after the sacking of Jose Mourinho. He is on loan from his Norwegian club, Molde FK, until the season’s end. His last managerial job in the Premier League was with, coincidentally, Cardiff. Manchester United is no longer a team that can regard itself as the ruler of English soccer. It has not won the Premier League since Ferguson’s departure. It has reached just one Champions League quarterfinal. In two of the last five years, it has not even taken part in Europe’s elite competition. It is, most certainly, not the most revered team in the land. Image Jose Mourinho was driven away from his home after leaving his job as Manchester United’s manager.CreditPhil Noble/Reuters Ever since the rain-soaked day that Ferguson left, this is a club that has let itself down. To many, the cause of that failure is in the one field where United still leads the world: For all the disappointments of the last five years, it remains a corporate and commercial juggernaut. In September, it registered record revenues of 590 million pounds ($748 million), despite another disappointing display in the Champions League. It is a social media behemoth, too. As Richard Arnold, its managing director, said on a conference call, Manchester United has more Facebook followers than the N.B.A., the N.F.L., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball combined. It does not need to be successful to make money or to be popular. Manchester United has, the theory runs, focused so much of its attention on its off-field business that its on-field performance has been left to drift. There is some merit to that assessment; certainly, it raises an interesting question as to whether the game’s elite clubs any longer need to win games and trophies to turn a profit, and if they do not, at what point those in charge of running profitable enterprises are likely to notice that something is wrong. Yet those with an intimate knowledge of how the club is run suggest that the problem is, in fact, the polar opposite. United is not suffering because too few people are employed to think about how to improve the team, but because there are too many. When Ferguson left, Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice chairman — the man who runs the business on behalf of the owners, the Glazer family — insisted repeatedly that he did not see the need to appoint a technical director, someone to oversee the sporting operation while he focused on the commercial side. Despite being employed by every major club on the planet, that model, he felt, did not work for United. Together with the manager and the recruitment department, Woodward was adamant that he had the global network to bring in the superstars he felt United, as a brand, required. On one occasion, he gleefully held up his cellphone to a group of journalists to show that Jorge Mendes, soccer’s most powerful agent, was calling him. Under Woodward’s auspices, though, United’s recruitment operation has been a mess. Though it has wasted millions on poor signings, just as damning is the money it has not spent: spending months preparing deals for the likes of Toni Kroos, Cesc Fàbregas and Cristiano Ronaldo, only to find them signing for rivals or being given more lucrative contracts at their current clubs. Last January, United called to ask how much it would cost to sign Virgil van Dijk from Southampton as he was having a medical evaluation at Liverpool. The paperwork had already been signed. Image In happier times, Alex Ferguson received a hero’s sendoff in 2013.CreditAndrew Yates/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Until July, the club had three employees nominally running the recruitment department: Marcel Bout, the head of international recruitment; Javier Ribalta, the head of recruitment; and Jim Lawlor, the chief scout appointed under Ferguson. (Ribalta has since left to take a position at the Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg.) The three oversaw an army of 55 full-time scouts around the world: one watching senior players and one for junior players in every major market on the planet. Manchester City, the Premier League champion and, to most eyes, the gold standard of player recruitment, has just 35. The result has been a surfeit of information and a dearth of responsibility, as competing factions jostle for supremacy. Agents, like Mendes and Paul Pogba’s representative, Mino Raiola, have drifted in and out of favor (all four players that United signed in 2016 came from Raiola’s client list). Where City and Liverpool, in particular, can move swiftly and nimbly in the market, United is slow, lumbering. That applies in other fields, too. The academy is overseen by John Murtagh, Nick Cox and Nicky Butt. They serve as head of youth development, academy operations manager and head of academy. As with recruitment, it is hard to discern a clear plan, a grand vision; just a club made heavy by its bloated staffing levels, stuck between legacy appointments and new hires. In some cases, executives have two personal assistants, one longstanding, the other brought in to replace someone who has not left. That lack of decisiveness, of direction, is evident elsewhere. United was forced to pay Marouane Fellaini, the midfielder, “double” what he had initially asked for — according to Eladio Paremes, a former spokesman for Mendes — because it delayed for so long over offering him new terms. Other players, unable to agree to a deal, have had automatic one-year extensions triggered in order to buy the club time. Though the youth structure has improved considerably in recent years, United still does not pay expenses for those enrolled in its development programs; most of its rivals do. Unlike City, it does not place its scholars in one of Manchester’s most illustrious private schools. In July, its respected head of youth scouting, Derek Langley, left because of his belief that the club’s leadership was not listening to his concerns. The result is a club lacking in direction and vision, unaware of what it wants to be. Woodward has, at least, climbed down on the need to appoint a technical director. Part of the reason Solskjaer has been brought in short term as manager is to allow the club time to identify the right candidate for the senior position. When Ferguson left, Manchester United’s destiny was in its own hands. It has squandered that privilege. Now, it is in a race simply to keep up, to make sure it is not consigned to history.

There were no surprises, just a predictable outcome many expected with how Saturday played out. Oklahoma was selected at the heavily debated fourth spot and will meet No. 1 Alabama in one semifinal Dec. 29 in the Orange Bowl in Miami. Clemson and Notre Dame, both undefeated and with five common opponents, will meet in the other semifinal at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. There was some thought Georgia, which was ranked fourth in the final playoff rankings last Tuesday, did enough in nearly upsetting undefeated powerhouse Alabama in Saturday’s SEC Championship game to become the first two-loss team included in the playoff. But Oklahoma, the Big 12 champion which defeated Texas on Saturday to avenge its lone loss, was given the nod as Georgia finished fifth in the rankings. “In this instance, when one team wasn’t unequivocally better than the other, we went to the protocol, and on this one the one-loss conference champion carried the day,” committee chairman Rob Mullens said. The committee met until 1:30 a.m. Sunday and again at 10:30 that morning, according to Mullens. Some were split on who should be the fourth team. The résumés were similar. Georgia had eight wins over teams .500 or better and Oklahoma had seven. Both had three victories over ranked opponents. The Sooners, however, had just one less loss and won their league while Georgia blew a 14-point, second-half advantage to Alabama on Saturday and was crushed, 36-16, by three-loss LSU. “I’m not crying over split milk,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “We had our opportunities in the Alabama game and did not finish and did not take advantage of them. I certainly think we’re one of the four best teams in the country, but I also know we’re not in the playoff.” The oddsmakers expect Alabama and Clemson to meet in the national championship game for the third time in four years. Both are heavy favorites, the Crimson Tide by 14 ¹/₂ and Clemson by 11. It’s the first time in the playoff that the two semifinal games have featured double-digit point spreads. Georgia was followed in the rankings by Ohio State, the Big Ten’s one-loss champion, Michigan, Central Florida, Washington and Florida. For the second straight year, the Big Ten was left out, but commissioner Jim Delany told The Athletic he doesn’t feel the need to expand the playoff. “Obviously [we] would love to be in system every year, but [I] have respect for those chosen and offer sincere congratulations to players and coaches at Alabama, Clemson, [Notre Dame] and [Oklahoma],” Delany said. see also Choice is simple: Georgia belongs in College Football playoff Forget the metrics and ignore the numbers, even if they... UCF, the AAC champion, was passed over despite its second consecutive perfect season — it has won 25 consecutive games — further evidence that a non-Power Five school will never receive a playoff bid in the current system. The Knights called themselves national champions last year after defeating Auburn in the Peach Bowl, even taking part in a parade. On Sunday, athletic director Danny White tweeted his disappointment at being left out of what he described as an “invitational” not a playoff. This will be Notre Dame’s first playoff appearance, while Clemson is in for the fourth straight season. Oklahoma has reached the playoff twice before, but has never advanced to the title game. Alabama has been in the playoff in all four previous years and is looking to be the first repeat national champion since it won consecutive titles in 2011-12. The two games feature interesting subplots. Alabama-Oklahoma is a quarterback showdown featuring the top two Heisman Trophy contenders, Kyler Murray of Oklahoma and Tua Tagovailoa of Alabama. Tagovailoa suffered a high right ankle sprain in Saturday’s 35-28 win over Georgia, and coach Nick Saban said Sunday the sophomore will be out two weeks and is hopeful to get him back for the game. Notre Dame-Clemson, meanwhile, is the true ACC championship game. The independent Fighting Irish faced five ACC teams, and handled Syracuse, which nearly upset Clemson on Sept. 29, far more easily than the Tigers did, routing the Orange, 36-3, on Nov. 17 at Yankee Stadium. The last time Notre Dame was on this stage was in the 2012 BCS national championship game, when it was crushed by Alabama, 42-14. “I think the best thing about it is the 2012 Alabama team is not in this playoff bracket,” coach Brian Kelly joked. Of the four teams, Notre Dame has to be considered the biggest surprise. The Irish were 4-8 two years ago and were the lowest of the four in the Associated Press’ preseason rankings at No. 12. “We’ve been on a journey here the last couple years,” Kelly said, “to put our football team back in this position.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Flipboard WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under alabama crimson tide ,  clemson tigers ,  college football ,  college football playoff ,  georgia bulldogs ,  notre dame fighting irish ,  ohio state buckeyes ,  oklahoma sooners Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Flipboard WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Choice is simple: Georgia belongs in College Football play...

sport Everyone Loves to Watch Zion Williamson Play. Maybe as Much as He Loves Playing. - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Everyone Loves to Watch Zion Williamson Play. Maybe as Much as He Loves Playing. Supported by On College Basketball Everyone Loves to Watch Zion Williamson Play. Maybe as Much as He Loves Playing. Image Zion Williamson is expected to stay only one season at Duke before entering the N.B.A. draft. He is already earning comparisons to Hall of Fame players.CreditCreditGerry Broome/Associated Press By Joe Drape Dec. 18, 2018 DURHAM, N.C. — It is difficult to reconcile the awe that comes out of the mouths of adults about Zion Williamson when you’re watching the player slumped in a chair after a 33-point blowout victory, answering goofy questions with a goofy smile. “Did you feel like a tight end on that breakaway?” “Is it true you were offered scholarships to play football?” “Do you feel pressure to put on a show when you get the ball?” Williamson, Duke’s star freshman and (many expect) a No. 1 N.B.A. draft pick by June, had just turned in the kind of performance against Yale that college hoops aficionados have come to expect from him: 20 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists and the requisite head-above-the-rim tomahawk dunk that has made him a staple of television highlight reels and internet video compilations. After absorbing each question, Williamson looked at his teammate Mike Buckmire, who pretended he was playing the role of Williamson’s consigliere. Buckmire nodded for him to answer. No, Williamson said, he did not feel like a tight end. Yes, he had received offers to play football. “They are not exaggerating — I did pick up a couple of football scholarships,” he said. As for his rim-rattling performance art? “If it’s there, I’m going to do it, because I like to put on a show,” he said with yet another big smile. In fact, everything about Williamson is big. At 6 feet 7 inches and 285 pounds, he is not only Paul Bunyan-esque for the college ranks but also, the website FiveThirtyEight noted, heavier than all but one active N.B.A. player. Williamson, however, is hardly earthbound. His 45-inch vertical leap is the highest since Duke started measuring its players, providing the foundation for his explosive moves to the basket — and the reason at least one reporter spoke with a physicist to try to calculate the damage a force like Williamson can cause to those who get in his way. Image Williamson is 6 feet 7 inches and 285 pounds, heavier than all but one active N.B.A. player, but his 45-inch vertical leap is the highest since Duke started measuring its players.CreditGrant Halverson/Getty Images North America While N.B.A. teams long ago took note of Williamson’s skill set — ESPN published an N.B.A. draft preview of him before he had thrown down his first dunk for Duke — it is online where his legend was made and where it continues to grow. YouTube channels like BallIsLife first started spreading the gospel of Zion when he was a high school star in Spartanburg, S.C., uploading his raw clips and declaring him the “Best Mixtape Player of Our Generation.” So it is little wonder that Williamson has 2.1 million followers on Instagram or that his time with the second-ranked Blue Devils (9-1) is likely to be short. Nor is it surprising that just 10 games into his collegiate career he is being compared to onetime basketball man-children and subsequent N.B.A. All-Stars like Shawn Kemp and Charles Barkley. Barkley, a Hall of Famer, was known as the Round Mound of Rebound at Auburn, where his playing weight was about the same as Williamson’s now. But Barkley insisted the similarities ended there. Williamson, he said, is “way more explosive.” “My weight was fat,” Barkley told the radio host Dan Patrick recently. “I don’t think he’s got fat weight on him.” Jay Bilas, the ESPN commentator and former Duke forward, does not dare compare Williamson to LeBron James, but he said that he has not been as bowled over by a natural talent since he first saw James 16 years ago, when he was part of the broadcast team for James’s first nationally televised game. “There has never been anyone like Zion at any level,” Bilas said. “There has never been anyone of his size who can move like him.” Image Williams celebrates with fellow freshman R.J. Barrett, who is probably his biggest challenger for the top spot in next year’s N.B.A. draft.CreditBen Mckeown/Associated Press Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, too, said Williamson is like no player he has come across in a 44-year career filled with top picks, national championships and Olympic gold medals. “He is just a unique athlete, and I think part of that is that he was a point guard up until eighth grade,” Krzyzewski said. “He has the ability to handle the ball and to drive without charging, and his second jump — it’s extraordinary how quickly he gets up and gets his miss on any kind of drive.” Williamson absorbed the intricacies of backcourt play from his stepfather, Lee Anderson, who played at Clemson, before a growth spurt remade his game and his future in it. In the summer between eighth and ninth grade, Williamson grew from 5-foot-9 to 6-foot-3. He continued to fill out through high school. In the Blue Devils’ season-opening game against Kentucky, he displayed his varied skill set over a 27-second stretch in which he made a 3-pointer, slashed to the basket for a thunderous dunk, blocked a shot and then, on the run, threaded a bounce pass through traffic to his teammate R.J. Barrett, another freshman and probably his biggest challenger for the top spot in next year’s N.B.A. draft. Among Williamson’s 20 points against Yale was a balletic layup on which he appeared to float through a thicket of Elis before softly dropping the ball through the basket, but also yet another thunderous dunk. In between, he threw at least one nifty pass to Barrett, who poured in 30 points. “Both are phenomenal,” Bilas said. “But Zion will sell more tickets.” One of the intangibles that Krzyzewski particularly enjoys is Williamson’s joyfulness. It is on display in pregame warm-ups, when the big man with a guard’s mentality alternates high-wattage smiles with acrobatic dunks and all manner of fist bumps and hand slaps with his teammates. The joy was palpable in the waning moments of the Yale blowout here, when Williamson — his afternoon complete — remained on his feet in front of the Duke bench, offering full-throated support to the extras taking a rare turn in the Cameron Indoor Stadium spotlight. The joy was there as the locker room was closing later, too, after Williamson decided to release Buckmire, a walk-on and pre-med student, from his consigliere duties. Williamson swallowed Buckmire into his arms, and for a moment, the 6-2, 170-pound guard disappeared. “You are good at this,” Williamson said amid muffled laughter.

sport Philip Rivers Doesn’t Need a Ring to Be Great - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Log In Sports|Philip Rivers Doesn’t Need a Ring to Be Great Image Philip Rivers has not missed a game since taking over as the Chargers’ quarterback in 2006.CreditCreditHarry How/Getty Images Keeping Score Philip Rivers Doesn’t Need a Ring to Be Great Philip Rivers has not missed a game since taking over as the Chargers’ quarterback in 2006.CreditCreditHarry How/Getty Images Supported by By Benjamin Hoffman Jan. 4, 2019 In 2006, the San Diego Chargers had a conundrum. Their starting quarterback from the previous season was a 27-year-old free agent who was coming back from a severe shoulder injury. While they had gone 21-11 over the previous two seasons, they had not won a playoff game since 1994, and they had a first-round pick from the 2004 draft on the bench, ready to step in as a starter. The player they chose to let go, Drew Brees, went on to become the most productive passer in N.F.L. history. Yet 12 seasons later it’s fairly easy, after considering the salary and risk involved in the situation, to make the argument that the Chargers made the right call in letting him leave. That’s the strange reality of Philip Rivers, who replaced Brees, established himself as a franchise quarterback, and yet has been largely overlooked ever since in the discussions of the game’s best quarterbacks despite a regular-season résumé that stands out even amid today’s bloated passing numbers. And whether it is fair to him or not, his lack of a Super Bowl victory is no small factor in that disregard. So as he heads into the playoffs for the sixth time — his Chargers (now in Los Angeles) will play at the Baltimore Ravens in the wild-card round on Sunday — Rivers is once again having his worth debated. Rivers, who has not missed a start since being named the Chargers’ starter, has had a career that may not quite match up to Brees’s, but comes much closer than most would think, especially once you factor in the benefit of Brees having played half of his games in the passer-friendly Superdome in New Orleans. And while he may not have as high of a profile as two other big-name quarterbacks taken in the 2004 draft — Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger — the case can be made that he was better than either of his famous peers in the regular season. Image Rivers, right, spent two seasons on the bench waiting for an opportunity behind San Diego’s starter, Drew Brees.CreditKevin Sullivan for The New York Times That 2004 draft class can claim a distinction that even the 1983 group — one that includes Dan Marino, John Elway and Jim Kelly — can’t: It had three quarterbacks reach 50,000 career passing yards. It’s a total achieved by just nine quarterbacks, and one-third of them were selected within 11 picks of one another (Manning first, Rivers fourth, Roethlisberger 11th). In that group of 2004 quarterbacks, Rivers leads in touchdowns (374), touchdown percentage (5.3 percent), adjusted yards per passing attempt (7.7) and passer rating (95.6). He has thrown the fewest interceptions (178) and has the lowest interception percentage (2.5 percent). But Brees, Manning and Roethlisberger have something Rivers does not: a championship ring. Brees, whose shoulder healed just fine in New Orleans, won Super Bowl XLIV with the Saints while Manning and Roethlisberger have each won a pair of championships. Despite the ever-present talk that a ring would complete his N.F.L. résumé, Rivers himself has tried to play down the validation that would come with finally winning a championship. N.F.L. Playoff Predictions: Our Picks for the Wild-Card Round The Texans, Cowboys, Ravens and Bears are all favorites at home, but there may be some upsets lurking. Look out for the Colts.Jan. 3, 2019 “Not that you ever settle,” Rivers told ESPN of pursuing a Super Bowl win. “By no means am I saying I’m settling. It’s not that. It’s just that it’s not going to define happiness for me at the end of the day.” Ignoring the modern obsession with evaluating players’ legacies almost entirely by championships, Rivers already has a career worthy of celebrating. It has had ups and downs. He has led the league in touchdowns and he has led the league in interceptions (twice). He has won 11 or more games in four seasons — including this one — and his play once dropped off so severely that when he returned to normal in 2013, he was awarded the N.F.L.’s Comeback Player of the Year Award. And his personality, on and off the field, has had its ups and downs as well. At one point he was a regular subject of internet mockery, with satirical sites like KissingSuzyKolber poking fun at his throwing style and his off-field demeanor. But he has endeared himself through pure longevity and a commitment to chucking the ball downfield, to the point that he was able to generate one of the feel-good internet moments of the 2018 season when cameras caught his earnest reaction to a change in fortune during the Chargers’ win over Pittsburgh in Week 13. There is no perfect statistic to evaluate the total impact of an N.F.L. career, but ProFooballReference’s attempt at creating one, Approximate Value, rates Rivers at 177, Roethlisberger at 171 and Manning at 150, ranking them eighth, ninth and 16th among quarterbacks in N.F.L. regular-season history. In all likelihood, Roethlisberger’s superior won-lost record, and his Super Bowl rings, will make him the easiest Hall of Fame vote of the three. But the debates could rage endlessly between Rivers (regular-season success) and Manning (postseason success), with either, or both, being enshrined in Canton based on the views of the group of writers responsible for election once they become eligible. Image Death, taxes and Philip Rivers heaving it downfield.CreditKelvin Kuo/Associated Press Before any of that comes to pass, Rivers has unfinished business. At 37, he remains a productive passer, and the team currently around him is one of the most talented he has ever played with. The Chargers have a brutally difficult task this weekend in trying to slow Lamar Jackson and the Ravens — they lost to Baltimore by 22-10 two weeks ago — but even if this is not their year, their roster construction should allow them to compete again in the 2019 season. And should Rivers never win a Super Bowl, he would still have achieved a level of production and durability that should keep him in the discussion of the game’s best quarterbacks long after he retires. He would simply fall into the category of Fran Tarkenton, Dan Fouts, Marino and Kelly as one the best quarterbacks to have never won a Super Bowl. And there is far worse company a player could keep.

sport In Texas, the Land of Football, It’s Rugby to the Rescue - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index College Football Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper College Football|In Texas, the Land of Football, It’s Rugby to the Rescue Supported by In Texas, the Land of Football, It’s Rugby to the Rescue Image Football coaches watched a video during the tackling certification program at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex.CreditCreditCooper Neill for The New York Times By Ken Belson Jan. 2, 2019 ARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys. The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball. The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize. “It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head. From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States. After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous. That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks. “The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association. Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play. Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football. Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down. Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies. Image Rex Norris of Atavus met with coaches after the presentation.CreditCooper Neill for The New York Times In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health. Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation: “We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.” Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said. Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus. But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level. And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier. Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion. Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’ At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season. “When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.” As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus. Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas. “I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Teaching Football Players the Rugby Way: Tackling Shoulders First.

Roundup Islanders Rally Behind a Teammate, and Then Past the Red Wings Image Niklas Kronwell of the Red Wings delivering a jarring check to Anders Lee, the Islanders’ captain, during the first period Saturday night. Lee returned to action, but his goal streak ended at four games.CreditCreditDuane Burleson/Associated Press By The Associated Press Dec. 8, 2018 Niklas Kronwall scored to give Detroit a 2-0 first-period lead on Saturday night and later in the period knocked Anders Lee off his feet with a high, hard hit. After that, it was the Islanders who delivered the key blows. Matt Martin scored the tiebreaking goal with 16 minutes 36 seconds remaining in the third period, giving the Islanders a 3-2 victory over the host Red Wings. Moments after Kronwall’s hit on Lee, the Islanders’ captain, Josh Bailey, took Kronwall down in the corner. Then Bailey and Dylan Larkin squared off, drawing fighting majors. Later in the first period, there was another fight, between Justin Abdelkader, who scored the Red Wings’ first goal, and Johnny Boychuk. “I thought when that hit happened, with Bailey going over there and answering the bell, I thought from that standpoint, he pulled the rest of the group in,” Islanders Coach Barry Trotz said. “Our leadership, the guys were really good.” Lee was able to return to the game after being stitched up, and he did not seem to have much of an issue with the hit, for which no penalty was called. “I had my head down, looking for the puck in my skates, and he hit me with a good shoulder check,” said Lee, whose goal streak ended at four games. “That’s hockey.” Kronwell said: “The hard part when you’re coming north-south is to not touch the head at all. I think when you’re skating, you’re in a position where your head is basically the point of your body that’s the most forward. You try to go through the chest or shoulder. Sometimes, you end up catching the head.” After Casey Cizikas and Ryan Pulock scored in the second period to tie it, Martin’s winner came when Luke Witkowski of the Red Wings was not able to handle the puck cleanly when it bounced off the boards behind the net. It ended up on Martin’s stick in front of the goal, and he capitalized for his fourth goal of the season. “I loved the way we responded tonight,” Martin said. “We were 2-0 down and our captain is down and bleeding — that’s a pretty bad start, but we talked about it after the first period and we decided we weren’t going to let this one get away that easily. We had to step up. Our leading scorer got into a fight, which you don’t see very often, but that’s the kind of player Josh is.” Image Mika Zibanejad scoring the Rangers’ first goal against the Panthers. He also scored in the shootout.CreditBrynn Anderson/Associated Press RANGERS 5, PANTHERS 4 Kevin Hayes had the game-deciding goal in the third round of the shootout, giving the Rangers a win at Florida and an end to their three-game losing streak. After Mika Zibanejad and Kevin Shattenkirk scored in the shootout for the Rangers and Jonathan Huberdeau countered for the Panthers, Hayes beat Roberto Luongo for the win. Hayes also had two assists. Zibanejad, Vladislav Namestnikov, Matt Beleskey and Fredric Claesson scored in regulation for the Rangers, who improved to 4-1 in overtime and swept the season series from Florida, 3-0. Keith Yandle, Huberdeau, Aaron Ekblad and Aleksander Barkov had goals for the Panthers, who finished 3-2-3 on their eight-game homestand. Henrik Lundqvist had 27 saves for the Rangers and stopped the Panthers’ first attempt in the shootout, by Barkov. “It felt, going into overtime, we needed this extra point no matter what,” Lundqvist said.

Asks Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith to Return $5,000 Donation Supported by M.L.B. Asks Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith to Return $5,000 Donation Image Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi on election night earlier this month. The senator is competing in a runoff election this week against Mike Espy.CreditCreditChris Todd/EPA, via Shutterstock By David Waldstein Nov. 25, 2018 Around the time that inflammatory comments by Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi invoking public hangings surfaced on video, Major League Baseball donated $5,000 to her campaign. After word of the donation — the maximum legal amount — broke over the weekend, M.L.B. asked for the money back. The contribution, first reported Saturday by Popular Information, is embarrassing to M.L.B., which has several initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in its sport. Many of Hyde-Smith’s comments, some of which she has apologized for or attempted to explain, appear to contradict baseball’s mission. “The contribution was made in connection with an event that M.L.B. lobbyists were asked to attend,” an M.L.B. spokesman said in a statement. “M.L.B. has requested that the donation be returned.” The Hyde-Smith campaign reported its contributions to the Federal Election Commission on Nov. 23. That was almost two weeks after her comments about public hanging came to light, but baseball says the donation was made earlier in the month at a political event by M.L.B. lobbyists who were unaware of her remarks. The baseball commissioner’s office has its own political action committee and donates to politicians on both sides of the aisle to help promote its causes in Congress, like protecting M.L.B.’s antitrust exemption and other legislation, like how teams pay minor league players. Video Mississippi has elected only Republicans to the Senate for the last three decades. But a controversial remark by a Republican incumbent, Cindy Hyde-Smith, could flip one of the state’s seats. Here’s how we got here.Published OnNov. 26, 2018CreditCreditChris Todd/EPA, via Shutterstock [For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] Charles Johnson, an owner of the San Francisco Giants, also made contributions to Hyde-Smith. He and his wife, Ann, each donated $2,700. There are a handful of minor league baseball teams in Mississippi, but none affiliated with the Giants. [Read more here about the race between Cindy Hyde-Smith and Mike Espy.] Hyde-Smith, a Republican appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant in March to replace Thad Cochran, who resigned for health reasons, is facing Mike Espy, a Democrat, in Tuesday’s runoff election. Since M.L.B. made the contribution, further reports have come to light showing Hyde-Smith’s support for the Confederacy. In a photograph on her Facebook page, she is shown wearing the cap of a Confederate soldier and holding a musket. The caption reads, “Mississippi history at its best.” She was also seen on video espousing voter suppression among college students to a small group of supporters after the Nov. 6 general election. Hyde-Smith is heard to say that it would be “a great idea.” She later labeled the comment a joke. She said the same thing about her earlier statement, made at a rally on Nov. 2, that she would happily sit in the front row for public hangings. The comment stirred up the painful history of lynchings in Mississippi and elsewhere. Since then, several large corporations, including Walmart, AT&T and Pfizer, have also asked for their contributions to be returned. Correction:  An earlier version of this article misstated the manner in which a Giants owner, Charles Johnson, and his wife donated to Cindy Hyde-Smith’s campaign. The donation was made directly to the campaign, not through a super PAC. An earlier version also published statements from Johnson and the Giants in error. They referred to a different donation by Johnson, not his contribution of Hyde-Smith’s campaign. The article also misstated the timing of M.L.B.’s donation to Hyde-Smith. It came about two weeks after video of her comments invoking public hangings emerged, not two weeks after she made the comments.

sport Mookie Betts and Christian Yelich Easily Win M.V.P. Awards - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Mookie Betts and Christian Yelich Easily Win M.V.P. Awards Supported by Mookie Betts and Christian Yelich Easily Win M.V.P. Awards Image Mookie Betts of the Boston Red Sox helped his team win the World Series and on Thursday was named the American League’s M.V.P.CreditCreditHarry How/Getty Images By Billy Witz Nov. 15, 2018 As baseball has been redefined by analytics in recent years, one role that has been largely reconsidered is that of the leadoff batter. No longer is it the realm of the pesky, pitch-spoiler who gets on frequently and steals bases. The Houston Astros put their leading home run hitter, George Springer, at the top of the order and rode his hot bat to a World Series title in 2017. In spring training, the Yankees tinkered with their lineup briefly by batting Aaron Judge first in an exhibition game. It was on that day in March when Alex Cora, the new Boston manager who had previously been a coach with Houston, was asked what his prototype leadoff hitter looked like. “For me, somebody very close to Mookie Betts,” Cora said. “That’s my vision of the leadoff guy.” That assessment proved to be prescient this season as Betts, who led his team to a franchise-best 108 wins and a World Series title, followed that up by winning the American League Most Valuable Player Award on Thursday. Christian Yelich of the Milwaukee Brewers was named M.V.P. of the National League. Betts was a leadoff batter and more for Boston. He displayed a dizzying degree of offensive versatility in his lithe 5-foot-9, 180-pound frame. He batted .346 and posted a .640 slugging percentage — the highest figures in the majors — while stealing 30 bases and hitting 32 home runs, both career-highs. And if the essence of a leadoff batter remains scoring runs, Betts did that, too. He scored 129 times, the most in the majors. Such dynamic offense paired with his stellar defense in right field — he recently won his third consecutive Gold Glove — got Betts the first-place vote on 28 of 30 M.V.P. ballots. While there was some discussion during the Red Sox playoff run about who the most valuable member of the team was — Betts or the designated hitter J.D. Martinez — the baseball writers who voted left little doubt as to their opinion. Image The Brewers’ Christian Yelich, led the National League in batting average and O.P.S.CreditAaron Gash/Associated Press Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, who finished second to Betts, and Martinez, who finished fourth, each got one of the two remaining A.L. first-place votes. Cleveland Indians third baseman Jose Ramirez, who was named either third or fourth on 21 ballots, finished third. It was the fourth second-place finish in seven seasons for Trout, who has won the award twice. Betts is the first M.V.P. to serve primarily as a leadoff batter since Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies won the National League award in 2007, and the first in the American League since Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners won in 2001. Just as Betts lapped the field, so, too, did Yelich. He garnered 29 of 30 N.L. first-place votes to easily outpace Chicago Cubs second baseman Javier Baez and Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado. The only first-place vote that did not go to Yelich went to Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom, who finished fifth in the voting after being named the winner of the N.L.’s Cy Young Award on Wednesday. Freddie Freeman, a first baseman for the Atlanta Braves, finished fourth in the M.V.P. voting. The left-handed hitting Yelich, like Betts, led his league in hitting with a .326 average and also led the N.L. with a 1.000 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. He hit 36 home runs and stole 22 bases. The National League race was considered wide open entering the final month. But Yelich’s dominant second half — he had a 1.129 O.P.S. after the All-Star break — fueled the Brewers’ September surge that led them to the best record in the National League after defeating the Cubs in a playoff for the Central Division title. It was the team’s eighth consecutive win. Yelich’s victory on Thursday was also a nice reward for Brewers General Manager David Stearns, who acquired Yelich from the Miami Marlins last winter for four prospects. Yelich, who will turn 27 in December, is under contract through 2022. The Red Sox have a similar anchor in Betts, 26, who does not reach free agency for two more seasons. As the Red Sox burst out of the gate this season, winning 18 of their first 20 games, it was fitting that Betts was their catalyst in the leadoff spot nearly every night. In an era of carefully tracked launch angles and fly-ball rates, Betts distinguished himself by hitting the ball hard, but also with a discerning eye. He was at his best against the division-rival Yankees, who could not push their way past Boston. In 17 games against the Yankees, Betts batted .415 with 10 doubles, three homers, 13 walks and 15 runs batted in. The victory by Betts marked the third consecutive year that a league M.V.P. had also won a World Series title, following Jose Altuve of the Astros last year and Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs in 2016. Before that, it had been exceedingly rare. Between Kirk Gibson, who won the M.V.P. for the World Series-champion Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988, and Bryant, the only other league M.V.P. to win a World Series title in the same season was Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants in 2012.

sport Gonzaga coach Mark Few on college basketball corruption Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Gonzaga coach Mark Few wants NCAA to 'make decisions' in corruption investigation Dan AgnewYahoo SportsDecember 10, 2018, 1:12 AM GMT Gonzaga head coach Mark Few calls a play against Tennessee on Sunday, Dec. 9, 2018, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Darryl Webb) PHOENIX – It isn’t just the FBI that wants to clean up college basketball. The head coach of one of the nation’s top basketball programs wants it cleaned up as well – and he’s not afraid to call out the head of the NCAA by name. Scroll to continue with content Ad While many of college basketball’s marquee programs have been caught up in a massive federal corruption case in the past year, it’s been business as usual for the Gonzaga Bulldogs, who are 9-1 and enjoyed a two-week run as the No. 1 team in the land. They’ll likely remain in the top 5 after falling 76-73 to No. 7 Tennessee in a thriller at the Jerry Colangelo Classic. Competing at the highest level of the sport has become a regular experience for Gonzaga in Few’s 20 years at the helm. All this while somehow avoiding any connection to the FBI’s wide-sweeping investigation that involves illegal funneling of money to top-notch recruits. Among the schools implicated in the probe: No. 2 Kansas, No. 8 Auburn, Arizona, Louisville, USC and several more. But even as the investigation drags on and casts a dark cloud over the sport, Few thinks Sunday’s game is a prime example that good basketball programs can also follow the rules. “There’s two teams today who were competing who do it right. I know that to be true,” Few said. “And there’s a lot of teams who do it right – the national champions two out of the last three years. There’s a lot of great things. This thing is worth saving.” NCAA president Mark Emmert said earlier this week he doesn’t expect any schools to be hit with major sanctions this season, making certain that this investigation will drag out for a long time – potentially years. The FBI released its findings and information to the NCAA in November so it can begin its own investigation. Few doesn’t see what the holdup is. Story continues “I’m disappointed. I don’t think this is something the NCAA needs to take their time on,” he said. “There’s teams out here who are competing for Final Fours and national championships and they don’t need to stall this thing out. They need to make decisions and roll with it. I think that’s on Emmert. Emmert needs to step up and be a leader and make some quicker decisions.” Three people involved in the scandal have already been convicted of wire fraud, while many others are still facing trials. That includes former assistant coaches at prominent teams. How deep this will all go is anyone’s guess, but teams like Gonzaga will continue to plug away and insist they’re doing things the right way. It’s possible the Zags have stayed out of the negative headlines because of the way they recruit. Tucked away in Spokane, Washington, in a small media market and playing in the mid-major West Coast Conference, Gonzaga has always had to be creative when it comes to finding talent. It’s not going to compete with the blue-blood programs for the top-flight players, so instead Few and company stock the locker room with a combination of international players, transfers and a handful of 3- and 4-star talents. Look at the key contributors on this team, for instance. You have three key international recruits in Rui Hachimura (Japan), Killian Tillie (France) and Filip Petrusev (Serbia), two transfers in Brandon Clarke (San Jose State) and Geno Carndall (North Dakota), and a pair of Rivals 4-star recruits in Josh Perkins and Zach Norvell Jr. This is how the Bulldogs have gotten it done for most of the Few’s tenure, and it’s been wildly successful: 20 straight NCAA tournament bids, nine Sweet 16s and the one appearance in a national title game. Few claims his secret to staying out of trouble is simple. Just follow the rules. “Everybody’s got a value system and you can either adhere to that value system or not and you let it become compromised,” Few said. “(Illegal recruiting is) just something we don’t do.” More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Cowboys’ Jason Garrett tried to lure Jason Witten out of ‘Monday Night Football’ booth • Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray will honor Athletics contract, according to agent • Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh on potential NFL return: ‘I’m not going anywhere’ • Bulls suffer worst loss in franchise history mere days after firing Fred Hoiberg What to Read Next Back Sign in Sports Home Fantasy NFL NBA MLB NHL NCAAF Soccer Golf NCAAB MMA World Cup Boxing NASCAR Tennis WNBA NCAAW Olympics Indycar Horse Racing Cycling Odds Videos Podcasts Rivals Shop Help Jobs Yahoo Sites Home Mail Search News Finance Entertainment Lifestyle Sports Fantasy Sports Weather Tech Shopping Answers Tumblr Tools Help Account Info Careers About Terms (Updated) & Privacy (Updated)

For a second, it hung in the air, a foot or so above the white goal line. Manchester City, Liverpool, the Etihad Stadium crowd all held their breath. And then John Stones reached it, and sent it as far away from himself, from danger, as he could. Anthony Taylor, the referee, checked his watch for the goal-line technology reading that would determine if the entire ball had crossed the line before Stones reached it. He waited. Everyone waited. He shook his head. The slightest sliver of orange and purple leather had remained above the line — less than an inch. City could breathe again. The second ball — an hour or so later — traveled quicker, caught sweet by Leroy Sané’s left foot. It struck the sole of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s boot and flew past Alisson Becker’s outstretched hand. Its trajectory shifted, just enough. It struck the bottom of the far post, and skittered along the same white line. Another intake of breath. It clipped the foot of the near post. This time, Taylor did not need to look at his wrist. Fine lines, slender margins. Liverpool did not score, Manchester City did. Liverpool did not win, Manchester City did. It does not change everything: Liverpool remains at the top of the Premier League, four points clear of the reigning champion. But when the time comes to look back on this season, this result may have changed enough. Image John Stones cleared the ball off Manchester City’s goal line at the last possible instant. CreditShaun Botterill/Getty Images That is how it felt when Taylor blew his whistle, confirming that Sané’s goal had been enough to seal a 2-1 victory for Pep Guardiola’s team, enough to end Liverpool’s 19-game unbeaten run, enough to evaporate the faint aura of invincibility that had started to attach itself to Jürgen Klopp’s team. Manchester City’s players sank to their knees in ecstasy. The stands bounced and heaved. Guardiola — just moments removed from berating Martin Atkinson, the fourth official, for some perceived error by Taylor — embraced his coaching staff, and hugged his players. [More from Rory Smith: David Silva, Manchester City’s Key Piece, Is Now More Valuable Than Ever] Later, Guardiola would be asked if his captain, Vincent Kompany, should have been sent off, instead of receiving just a yellow card, for a first-half foul on Mohamed Salah: another fine line, another slender margin. Guardiola did not want to contemplate such a question “on a night like this,” he said. This was the moment, manager and players and fans had decided, on which the whole season would turn, when the slightest differences could have seismic consequences. Guardiola had made clear, in the days beforehand, that this was a game Manchester City could not afford to lose. It would, he believed, be “impossible” to catch up to a team as good as Liverpool — maybe the best in the world, he called Klopp’s side, trying to kill his foe with kindness — if it won and secured a 10-point lead with 17 games to play. Image Pep Guardiola, left, of Manchester City and Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp on the sideline.CreditPaul Ellis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The fans clearly felt the same way. As City cantered to the championship last season, the Etihad was a contented, mellow sort of place — quietly confident in its own obvious superiority. There was little tension, no drama. Against Liverpool, under pressure, it was raucous and angry, possessed of the same manic energy that infused Guardiola’s players. By the end, that energy had transformed into jubilation. Trailing Liverpool by four points, as City does now, is hardly ideal; a month ago, most people connected to City would have been hard-pressed to even imagine such a situation. But when the damage could have been so much worse, it felt like a blessing. City can celebrate all that it has gained; it need not worry about the ground it had lost. Four points is a couple of bad afternoons over the course of five long months. Four points is a lapse of focus in the league because of the demands of the Champions League. Four points is an unfortunate injury, or a needless sending-off. It is the bounce of a ball. It is a fine line, a slender margin. It is particularly precarious now, in what the Premier League has become: a two-tier competition in which, every week, six elite teams demonstrate their superiority over what are in theory their peers, but their pawns in practice. The pace that Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur — in third, just six points off the lead — have set this year has been historic. Last season City became the first ever side to pick up 100 points in a season. Both Guardiola’s team and Klopp’s side could reach that mark this year. Both win so remorselessly that what would qualify in ordinary circumstances as a perfectly acceptable, even praiseworthy, result — say, drawing away from home against a team pushing for a European place — may instead be a knockout blow. Image Roberto Firmino of Liverpool came down on top of Fernandinho during the second half on Thursday. CreditPaul Ellis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Logic seems to suggest that City is better placed to deal with those terms than Liverpool. Guardiola’s team, after all, knows what it takes to get to 100 points. It has proved it can win, week after week, for months at a time. Despite Liverpool’s smart (and expensive) recruitment, City’s playing resources remain deeper; Guardiola has more options at his disposal for the long slog of spring. More important, perhaps, City is not encumbered with the weight of history. It is not trying to win a championship for the first time in 29 years, trying to lift a curse, to escape the ghosts that Liverpool is trying to escape. As the denouement comes closer, Liverpool’s desperation will mount, mistakes will creep in, and points will slip away. City, the champion three times this decade, has no such reason to worry. It is not, though, quite so simple as that. The next few months are as much a test of City’s nerve as Liverpool’s. No team came close to keeping pace with Guardiola’s team last year. It sauntered to the title, setting itself the vaguely artificial target of getting a century of points just to stay motivated. This season represents a different sort of challenge, one in which City’s standards and its focus cannot slip, one in which it has a rival that has — so far, at least — been able to match its relentlessness. City has the head-to-head advantage, winning here and drawing in autumn at Liverpool’s Anfield. Narrow or not, it can regard itself as the better of the two teams. That, though, is not what will decide the title. The crown will go to whichever of these two — or Tottenham, outsider though it may be — can maintain the fearsome pace both have set so far. More to the point, it will go to the team that does not blink first. There is less than the width of a line between Manchester City and Liverpool, between Guardiola and Klopp: a roll of the dice, a spin of the ball. One has the lead, the other has the impetus. Who comes out on top when it matters, right at the end, will be whichever can thrive in a world of the finest lines, the most slender margins.

sport Wanted: A Jets Coach Who Suits Sam Darnold - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Wanted: A Jets Coach Who Suits Sam Darnold Supported by Wanted: A Jets Coach Who Suits Sam Darnold Image Sam Darnold had a poor season statistically, but he showed enough to convince the Jets that he is a future star.CreditCreditJim Rogash/Getty Images By Zach Schonbrun Dec. 31, 2018 FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — A day after the Jets fired Coach Todd Bowles following the team’s season-ending 38-3 loss to the New England Patriots, team chairman and chief executive Christopher Johnson said the franchise will move quickly in finding a replacement. Seven other N.F.L. teams have joined the Jets with vacancies at the top coaching spot, adding to the urgency felt by an organization that has not reached the playoffs since 2010. Speaking to reporters from the team’s practice facility on Monday, Johnson said he will work with General Manager Mike Maccagnan and Brian Heimerdinger, the team’s vice president of player personnel, without any external influence from consultants or search firms, unlike the last coaching search. Owner Woody Johnson, currently the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, might get a phone call or two with updates, but the ultimate decision will be made by Christopher, who is Woody’s younger brother. Perhaps the most critical figure in the selection, however, will be the rookie quarterback Sam Darnold. It is clear that the organization feels it has the foundational player to build around — coaching staff included. “The person doesn’t have to be an offense or defense-minded head coach,” Maccagnan said. “But we definitely want to make sure they have a plan in place to try to develop our young quarterback in Sam Darnold.” Maccagnan went as far as to say that, while the 21-year-old quarterback will not have a say in who the team decides upon, they plan to ask candidates to spend time with Darnold, which could give the team a sense of their chemistry. It sounded, well, a bit like an arranged date. But for Maccagnan, there are two clear examples of teams that engineered fantastic turnarounds based, in large part, around finding a coach that could get the most out of a young quarterback. The Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears are both headed to the playoffs this year, but at one time both teams struggled with a rookie quarterback, proceeded to hire a new coach with that quarterback in mind, and saw their prospects skyrocket. “We’ve developed what I think is a good plan,” Christopher Johnson said. “It really came together with Sam, and now we’re going to build with and around Sam.” Image Christopher Johnson, the Jets’ chairman and chief executive, said the team’s new coach will report directly to him.CreditSeth Wenig/Associated Press Asked what qualities he would look for in a new coach, Johnson began his response by mentioning that experience working with a quarterback would jump out to him. “Somebody who has created a great quarterback would be a big plus,” he said. Darnold, despite missing three games with a foot strain, tied for second in the league with 15 interceptions. But his final three games after returning from the injury were some of his best of the season. “I thought in the beginning of the year, I took a while to get comfortable,” Darnold said. “Then once I got comfortable in the offense, I felt very confident when I was out there. Just going to keep growing and keep trying to make those strides and watch the tape, see how I can get better and move forward from there.” The organizational structure will not change, with the new coach reporting directly to Johnson, rather than to Maccagnan, who has two years remaining on his contract. “The buck stops with me,” Johnson said. “I think I let the fans down here, and I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure we get to and win a Super Bowl.” After a third-straight season with at least 11 losses — the first time the franchise had accomplished that since 1977 — talk of championships rings somewhat hollow. But the Jets have more than $100 million in salary-cap space this off-season and Johnson said the plan is to be aggressive in spending it. Following Sunday’s loss, Jamal Adams, a safety, openly questioned the team’s assembled talent. Johnson said every team would love to have more talent, but the Jets struggled to find consistency under Bowles. “We had some talent on this team already,” Johnson said. “We should have done better in the win-loss column.” This time a year ago, Maccagnan noted, the team had many of the same question marks, but there was also a gaping hole at quarterback. With Darnold, at least that vacancy has been filled. And according to Johnson, that should make the Jets a very attractive opening in a crowded marketplace. “We haven’t had what we think is a franchise quarterback in a long time,” Johnson said, adding that “if you win here, you’re a freaking legend. That counts for something.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Learning From Rams and Bears, Jets Seek Coach Who Will Click With Young Passer.

sport Mayfield, "dangerous" Browns hand Panthers fifth loss in row Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Mayfield, "dangerous" Browns hand Panthers fifth loss in row TOM WITHERSAssociated PressDecember 9, 2018, 11:22 PM GMT 1 / 10 Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield celebrates after running back Nick Chubb rushed for a 4-yard touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Dec. 9, 2018, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/David Richard) CLEVELAND (AP) — Baker Mayfield took the snap in victory formation and dropped to one knee. The cocky rookie quarterback urged the crowd to make more noise, and when the clock hit zeroes, the stadium's sound system blasted "Danger Zone." The Browns have become hazardous to your playoff health. Mayfield outplayed Cam Newton, Jarvis Landry caught a touchdown pass and ran for another score and the Cleveland Browns damaged Carolina's postseason hopes with a 26-20 win Sunday over the Panthers, who dropped their fifth straight. Scroll to continue with content Ad Mayfield bravely threw a 51-yard TD pass into traffic to Landry, who had a 3-yard scoring run and added a long run — on a similar call — early in the fourth quarter to set up a go-ahead touchdown. Playing the spoiler role down the stretch, the Browns (5-7-1) kept their faint playoff hopes alive while improving to 3-2 under interim coach Gregg Williams, who needed just five games to match former Browns coach Hue Jackson's win total over two-plus seasons. "Everybody loves winning," said defensive end Myles Garrett. "It's different for us because of the negatives we've been through, but that's all in the past." Mayfield finished 18 of 22 for 238 yards, continuing his bounce back after throwing three interceptions in the first half last week at Houston. The brash No. 1 overall pick continues to develop and the Browns are growing with him. Mayfield was asked if he woke up feeling as dangerous as he did three weeks ago before beating Atlanta. "I think you know the answer to that one," he said, drawing laughter. Landry felt that way, too. "I guess waking up feeling dangerous is contagious," he said. "We pulled together as a team." Story continues There were no smiles or laughs in Carolina's locker room as the Panthers (6-7) suffered a loss that could haunt them for months and will increase the heat on coach Ron Rivera. Newton passed for 265 yards, but overthrew Jarius Wright on 4th-and-goal at the 3 with 2:35 left. Carolina got the ball back, but Newton, who has been playing with a sore right shoulder, badly missed Devin Funchess and was intercepted by Damarious Randall with 57 seconds left. Following the game, a glum Newton didn't offer any excuses. "We're done with the cliche sayings, it just comes down to doing our jobs," Newton said. "I'm not talking about nobody but myself." Carolina came in just a half-game out of the second wild-card spot in the NFC, but with only three games left, including two against New Orleans, the Panthers are going to need help to make the postseason. Christian McCaffrey had two TD runs for Carolina and finished with 101 total yards. "It stinks," McCaffrey said. "A lot of people are against us right now, but I'll fight for every one of these guys. That's exactly what I'm going to do and I know a lot of guys will do as well. We lost. We've lost a few in a row. It's kind of us against the world right now." Browns rookie Nick Chubb scored on a 1-yard run to give the Browns a 23-20 lead with 13:05 left. The score came one play after Landry took an inside handoff and weaved his way down field. Greg Joseph clanged the extra point off the left upright, keeping the Panthers within three. Newton drove the Panthers to the 3 before throwing two straight incompletions, ending Carolina's best chance to take the lead. Mayfield's 51-yard TD pass to Landry tied it 14-all with 8:27 left in the second quarter. Rolling left out of the pocket to buy some time, Mayfield stepped up and confidently delivered a perfect strike to Landry, who was well covered on the play by safety Eric Reid, his former LSU teammate. As fans celebrated, Landry and several teammates sat down in the end zone's corner and pretended to warm themselves around a camp fire. "It was cold outside," Landry said, smiling. FAST START On Cleveland's first play, Mayfield unloaded a pass that traveled more than 60 yards in the air to wide receiver Breshad Perriman for a 66-yard pickup. Two plays later, Landry scored on his short run. HOME SWEET HOME The Browns improved to 4-2-1 at FirstEnergy Stadium, clinching their first winning home season since going 7-1 under coach Romeo Crennel in 2007. "That's pretty cool because the Dawg Pound has always been loyal to us," said guard Joel Bitonio, who has spent all five of his NFL seasons with the team. "We want every team to say, 'We don't want to go to Cleveland to play.'" NEWTON'S LAW With his first completion, Newton eclipsed 3,000 yards passing for the eighth straight season. He came in needing 1 yard to reach the plateau and surpassed it on a 25-yarder to Curtis Samuel on Carolina's second snap. Newton joined Peyton Manning as the only quarterbacks in history to reach 3,000 yards in each of their first eight seasons. PAY DIRT Chubb became the first Browns player to score a rushing TD in five consecutive games since Greg Pruitt in 1975. ROOKIE RECORD Mayfield joined Kurt Warner (1999) and Brad Johnson (1996-97) as the only players since 1966 to throw at least one TD pass in each of their first 10 career starts. INJURIES: Panthers: No significant injuries. Browns: C JC Tretter barely made it off the field in the third quarter before dropping to his knees. Tretter, who has played several weeks with a severely sprained right ankle, returned to the game. UP NEXT Panthers: Host New Orleans on Sunday.

sport J.A. Happ Fits In With the Yankees. Would Manny Machado? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|J.A. Happ Fits In With the Yankees. Would Manny Machado? Supported by J.A. Happ Fits In With the Yankees. Would Manny Machado? Image J.A. Happ re-signed with the Yankees, agreeing to a two-year, $34 million contract, with a vesting option for a third year.CreditCreditCharles Krupa/Associated Press By Billy Witz Dec. 20, 2018 When the Yankees pursue a player through free agency or a trade, they have many ways to assess him. They can lean on their scouts, data analysts, training and medical staff members, and former teammates and coaches, allowing them to draw a detailed portrait of the player they would be acquiring. But there is one question the Yankees can rarely answer ahead of time: How will he acclimate to New York? If that question no longer applies to a blustery owner, it still revolves around a tempestuous fan base that largely holds its newcomers — particularly the steeply compensated or heavily publicized — to a high standard. It’s as if everyone asks: Well, if you can’t cope with some boos, how are you going to handle the Red Sox? So, with the Yankees ready to move Sonny Gray, a former All-Star pitcher who flopped in the Bronx, re-signing left-hander J.A. Happ to a two-year, $34 million contract, with a vesting option for a third year, was a particularly attractive proposition. In a cameo for the Yankees at the end of last season, Happ, 36, rarely gave the faithful reason to voice their displeasure. When he was acquired from Toronto in late July, Happ helped stabilize a rotation that had recently lost Jordan Montgomery to Tommy John surgery and that had an ace, Luis Severino, who was beginning a second-half unraveling. Though the Yankees could not chase down the Red Sox in the American League East, it was through no fault of Happ’s. He was 7-0 with a 2.69 earned run average over 11 regular-season starts. Six times he allowed one run or less. The only disappointment — other than missing a start with hand, foot and mouth disease — came at an inopportune moment: He was knocked around by the Red Sox in the opening game of the division series, which Boston won in four games. Happ, who gave up a three-run homer in the first inning to J.D. Martinez, was lifted in the third instead of being allowed to face him again. Happ allowed five runs — two of which scored against reliever Chad Green — in an eventual 5-4 defeat. When asked in a conference call with reporters on Thursday about the belief of some fans that his playoff appearance was more representative of what the Yankees were getting than the pitcher they saw over the final two-plus months of the regular season, Happ laughed. Image Happ was 7-0 in 11 regular-season starts for the Yankees, but lost his only start in the A.L. Division Series against the Red Sox.CreditBen Solomon for The New York Times “I think the body of work, maybe, is more important than one game,” Happ said. “Or maybe not important, but the body of work is maybe more indicative of the player you are. I certainly don’t mean to downplay the importance of a playoff game.” He added: “You go back and look at it, and J.D. Martinez hit a pitch that not a lot of guys hit. And he beat me on that pitch, and that’s all I can really say about that. I’m not really here to defend myself. I feel like my work stands for itself.” The Yankees’ off-season plans have thus far unfolded along the lines that General Manager Brian Cashman laid out at the winter meetings in Las Vegas. He said then that he was loath to make a deal that, if it turned sour, could hamstring the Yankees financially for years. So, rather than lay out a six-year deal for Patrick Corbin, the Yankees have bolstered their starting rotation by acquiring left-hander James Paxton, who is often injured but is under contract for only two more seasons, and by re-signing Happ. He described the third-year option — which will vest if he makes 27 starts or pitches 165 innings in 2020 — as a bet on himself. He has reached those benchmarks three of the last four years. With the rotation settled, Cashman is now turning his attention to the bullpen, which has lost Zach Britton and David Robertson to free agency, and to finding a middle infield replacement for shortstop Didi Gregorius, who is expected to miss three to five months after undergoing Tommy John surgery. To that end, the Yankees entertained the free agent Manny Machado on Wednesday, meeting with him at Yankee Stadium and then having dinner with him in Manhattan. It is unclear, though, how far the Yankees’ interest in Machado extends. Machado, who could replace Gregorius at short, then shift to third upon his return, is a premier talent and only 26. But his record of churlish behavior, which took center stage with the Los Angeles Dodgers during the playoffs this season, has left him with only three known suitors: the Chicago White Sox, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Yankees. He met with Chicago on Monday and Philadelphia on Thursday. Machado grew up in Miami admiring Alex Rodriguez and wearing No. 13, Rodriguez’s number with the Yankees. Machado has often indicated a fondness for the Yankees, but it remains to be seen whether the team would commit to the type of deal that he is surely seeking — something near 10 years and $300 million — for a player with character issues. There are no such questions about Happ. He provides a reliable presence in a rotation that, with the addition of Paxton and the return of Masahiro Tanaka, C.C. Sabathia and Severino, gives the team the opportunity to be competitive daily. Happ, who drew widespread interest, said he liked the Yankees’ clubhouse atmosphere, from the veteran leadership to the young players “who are playing the game the right way and putting in the work.” “It was a big reason why I felt comfortable going back,” he added. “Really, at this point in my career, I’d taken a lot of things into account, but really the chance to win was high on that list. I feel like this was a place that you come to the ballpark to win every day, and I really appreciated that.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees Find Happ a Good Fit (Well, There Was That One Day in October …).

sport Giants’ General Manager Is Noncommittal on Eli Manning’s Future - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Giants’ General Manager Is Noncommittal on Eli Manning’s Future Supported by Giants’ General Manager Is Noncommittal on Eli Manning’s Future Image Eli Manning started all 16 games for the Giants this season, finishing with a 92.4 quarterback rating, his highest since 2015.CreditCreditBen Solomon for The New York Times By Zach Schonbrun Jan. 2, 2019 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman gave a rousing endorsement of Coach Pat Shurmur, stood behind his decision to draft running back Saquon Barkley and laughed off suggestions that the team might trade receiver Odell Beckham Jr. But Gettleman, in his first news conference with reporters since the summer, remained surprisingly noncommittal on Wednesday about quarterback Eli Manning’s future with the Giants, leaving the door open for the organization to potentially move on from its two-time Super Bowl most valuable player this off-season. “We will do what’s in the best interest of the New York Giants,” Gettleman said, before adding: “What we’re trying to do here is build sustained success. That takes some brutal honesty, and it takes some tough decisions.” Gettleman said he and Manning had met for an “extensive” conversation on Monday that he deemed to be “very honest and upfront.” Notably, it was Manning who initiated the discussion. “Eli came in and wanted to talk,” Gettleman said. “It wasn’t like he was called to the principal’s office; he came to see me.” Manning, who turns 38 on Thursday and is under contract through the 2019 season, started all 16 games for the Giants this season and threw for 4,299 yards with 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He completed 66 percent of his passes, a career high, and finished with a 92.4 quarterback rating, his highest since 2015. But the Giants started with a 1-7 record this season before finishing 5-11, and they have an 8-23 record over the past two years with Manning as the starter. There are questions about his pocket presence, decision-making and arm strength — including from Beckham, who criticized Manning in an interview with ESPN in October. Gettleman pointed to the offense’s productivity in December, when the Giants scored 30, 40, 27 and 35 points (they also were shut out by the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 16). “He still can make N.F.L. throws,” Gettleman said of Manning. “He’s still got it.” Shurmur shares that opinion, having defended Manning throughout the season — and especially in recent weeks regarding the quarterback’s ability to return as the Giants’ starter in 2019. On Monday, he said Manning should be evaluated based on his performance in the second half of the season. “I think he was better able to showcase what he could do once we solidified the offensive line,” Shurmur said. “I think that’s a fair assessment.” As for how he planned to assess Manning’s performance amid the swings in fortune throughout the season, Gettleman was less effusive. He said he would watch film “until my eyes bleed.” Manning has a full no-trade clause, and cutting him would incur a sizable hit to the Giants’ salary cap. Nevertheless, Gettleman said, “everything is on the table for us.” Gettleman executed an extensive roster overhaul this season, his first as the team’s general manager. But the Giants still finished last in the N.F.C. East, leaving them with the No. 6 overall pick in the coming draft. This year’s class is not expected to contain the same caliber of quarterback prospects as last year, when the quarterbacks Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen and Josh Allen all went in the first 10 slots of the draft. Still, Gettleman defended his decision to draft Barkley, a running back, with the second overall pick in 2018. Barkley ran for 1,307 yards, a Giants rookie record, and added 721 yards receiving. “If I was in that situation 100 times, I’d draft him 100 times,” Gettleman said of Barkley. His assessment of the 2019 draft options remained the same as a year ago, he said, but he did not rule out selecting a quarterback. The Giants did select a quarterback in the fourth round last summer, Kyle Lauletta, who struggled in his lone appearance of the season, going 0 for 5 with one interception during the second half against Washington on Dec. 9. “You’re going to take the best player available,” Gettleman said. “You start reaching, you’re going to get in trouble.” The Giants played the final four games of the season without Beckham, who was sidelined with a quadriceps injury. Even though the Giants’ offense produced without Beckham, Gettleman quickly refuted any notion that the team might look to trade the star receiver, who signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension in August. “We didn’t sign him to trade him,” Gettleman said. Gettleman praised Shurmur’s steadiness after the team’s abysmal start, and he was pleased with the effort the team gave down the stretch, especially after being eliminated from playoff contention. “We’re not happy with 5-11, nobody is,” Gettleman said. “But I feel good about where we’re headed.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Manning’s Future Suddenly Seems Murky.

sport Yankees Court Patrick Corbin, but Keep Their Options Open - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Baseball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Baseball|Yankees Court Patrick Corbin, but Keep Their Options Open Supported by Yankees Court Patrick Corbin, but Keep Their Options Open Image Patrick Corbin spent this week on a free-agent tour of teams he is considering: the Nationals on Tuesday, the Phillies on Wednesday and the Yankees on Thursday.CreditCreditRick Scuteri/Associated Press By Billy Witz Nov. 30, 2018 STAMFORD, Conn. — When Patrick Corbin, the jewel of the free-agent pitching market, was married two weeks ago, his younger brother Kevin stood to give a toast to the newlyweds. As it concluded, according to one report, Kevin put on a Yankees cap and — to great applause — told the room that he was hoping the couple would soon be moving closer to their upstate New York home. That story was not relayed to Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman on Thursday, when he spent much of the day and an evening dinner in Manhattan with Corbin, the Arizona Diamondbacks left-hander; his wife, Jen; and his representatives. But Cashman said on Friday morning that he had read about the toast — in a tweet by The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal — and that he was trying not to read too much into it. From someone who attended Patrick Corbin’s recent wedding: “His younger brother gave a best-man speech and at the end took out a Yankees hat and put it on, which elicited a great applause, and said they all hoped that he and Jen would be moving closer to home.”— Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) November 30, 2018 “My understanding is it was more tongue in check — we’d love to have you come closer to home if you’re willing, because they are Yankee fans,” Cashman said between turns rappelling down the 22-story Landmark Building, practice runs for a winter festival program on Sunday night. He added: “Their Yankee allegiances are appreciated, but usually in this process, typically the thing that’s most important is the financial opportunities.” Corbin, who grew up in Clay, N.Y., just north of Syracuse, spent this week on a free-agent tour of teams he is considering: the Nationals on Tuesday, the Phillies on Wednesday and the Yankees on Thursday. All of them have money to spend, which they figure to need for Corbin, a 29-year-old left-hander whose foray into free agency is exquisitely timed. After becoming an All-Star for Arizona at age 23 in 2013, he had Tommy John surgery the next season and did not recover that form until this season, when he was 11-7 with a 3.15 earned run average. He struck out 11.1 batters per nine innings, allowed only 15 home runs and pitched 200 innings. He finished fifth in the National League Cy Young voting. A baseline for what Corbin is expected to cost his current suitors is most likely the six-year, $126 million contract the Chicago Cubs gave to Yu Darvish last year. The last two years, the Yankees have paid a dear price for their timidity in pursuing top-shelf starting pitching, passing on Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole, who wound up in Houston, and not being able to pry Corbin away from the Diamondbacks last winter. It is starting pitching that has failed the Yankees in the playoffs, first against the Astros in 2017 and then against the Red Sox this season. This winter, though, the Yankees’ other needs — a middle infielder to fill in for Didi Gregorius while he recovers from elbow surgery, refurbishing the bullpen and trading pitcher Sonny Gray (11 teams are interested, Cashman said) — have percolated in the background as they have pursued starting pitching. They quickly re-signed C. C. Sabathia (as well as left fielder Brett Gardner) and swung the first big trade of the winter to acquire the left-hander James Paxton from Seattle for a package of minor leaguers that included a top prospect, Justus Sheffield. Paxton and Sabathia will accompany Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka in the rotation. Now the question is whether Corbin will join them. Cashman said Thursday’s tour and dinner had been not so much a recruiting trip as an educational one. Corbin has pitched only once at Yankee Stadium — seven innings of two-hit ball in 2013. He was introduced to Manager Aaron Boone and the training and analytics staff, but also to how the Yankees operate with security, family services and dealing with a large news media following. The visit gave the Yankees a chance to get to know Corbin better — their bullpen coach, Mike Harkey, was Corbin’s pitching coach in Arizona, and he played briefly with Gregorius there — but also offered Corbin a chance to understand better what playing for the Yankees entails. “It’s happened twice,” Cashman said, explaining the value of these meetings, “where we’ve been in front of a player that we had an interest in and I walked out going: ‘We are crossing that one off the board. That’s not a fit for us in any way, shape or form.’” He added: “If it scares somebody off, they’re doing us a favor because you don’t want to bring somebody here who is not going to work here, and if during that process something comes up that scares us off, the same thing.” Cashman made a point of saying that Corbin was not a primary target. He said the team was not waiting on a decision from Corbin and would continue to pursue other options — mentioning pitchers who were with the Yankees recently, which would include J. A. Happ and Nathan Eovaldi. Perhaps that was posturing. Then again, the Yankees are coming off a season in which they ducked below the luxury tax threshold for the first time, and Cashman has declined to say whether he has an edict to stay under it again. But the Phillies’ owner, John Middleton, with plenty of cash cleared from the books and some promising young talent, told USA Today recently that he was ready “to spend money — and maybe even be a little stupid about it.” If Corbin’s family is longing for him to return close to home, Yankee Stadium is 265 miles from Clay, N.Y. The Phillies’ Citizens Bank Ballpark is a mere 13 miles farther.

sport N.B.A. G League to Offer Prospects $125,000 as Alternative to ‘One and Done’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|N.B.A. G League to Offer Prospects $125,000 as Alternative to ‘One and Done’ Supported by N.B.A. G League to Offer Prospects $125,000 as Alternative to ‘One and Done’ Image Players like Marvin Bagley III, who played one season at Duke before being drafted by the Kings, would be eligible to play in the G League without any college experience. CreditCreditSergio Estrada/USA Today Sports, via Reuters By Victor Mather and Kevin Draper Oct. 18, 2018 Elite 18-year-old basketball players will soon have another alternative to playing a “one and done” year at college. The N.B.A. announced Thursday that, beginning next year, select players would be able to earn $125,000 to play in its development league, the G League, for a year before entering the N.B.A. draft. In 2005, after several years of players going straight from high school to the N.B.A., including Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, the league began mandating a minimum age of 19. After the rule was put in place, the vast majority of talented high school players chose to enter the N.C.A.A. ranks and then usually declared for the N.B.A. draft after only a year. Eight of the top nine picks in this summer’s draft spent only one year in college. Many of those players, like Marvin Bagley III of Duke and Trae Young of Oklahoma, might well have chosen the G League as an alternative. The N.B.A.’s new program was first reported by ESPN. The N.B.A. promised that players would receive training in basketball as well as in “life skills” as part of the program. It did not disclose how many players would be invited into the program, but the G League said it would be “a very specific group of elite players.” As professionals, those players would also be able to accept endorsement money, something they could not do as amateurs in college. It was not yet known how the players would be assigned to G League teams, but regardless of which team they were on, they would be eligible for the next year’s draft and could wind up with any N.B.A. team. The unexpected result of the minimum age has been the prevalence of the one-and-done player. While some college basketball fans and coaches appreciated the chance to see top stars at least for a year, others rued the transitory nature of the players’ stays on campus. The N.B.A. justified the age limit by saying it was concerned that recent high school graduates were not ready for the rigors of the N.B.A. and life as adults. They also wanted to get agents and league personnel out of high school and A.A.U. gymnasiums and the seedy world of sneaker companies and recruiting. David Stern, the commissioner until 2014, wanted an age limit of 20 but compromised with the players’ union to make it 19. “We appreciate the N.B.A.’s decision to provide additional opportunities for those who would like to pursue their dream of playing professionally,” Mark Emmert, the president of the N.C.A.A., said in a statement on Thursday. “Obtaining a college education continues to provide unmatched preparation for success in life for the majority of student-athletes and remains an excellent path to professional sports for many. However, this change provides another option for those who would prefer not to attend college but want to directly pursue professional basketball.” This could be something of a stopgap measure for the development league. In a few years, 18-year-olds may be able to enter the N.B.A. directly again. Adam Silver, the commissioner, has said the N.B.A. was ready to get rid of “one and done.” The G League has 27 teams in mostly smaller cities, affiliated with N.B.A. teams. They play in front of mostly small crowds with players who for the most part will only be N.B.A. journeymen at best. Every once in a while, a player will have a star turn in the big league, like Andre Ingram, the 32-year-old G League veteran who was called up for a game by the Los Angeles Lakers and scored 19 points in an exhilarating performance. The 18-year-olds in the new program would not be eligible to be called up to the N.B.A. during their year in the G League. G League players tend to be in their mid-20s. They make significantly less than the $125,000 a year that will be offered to the elite 18-year-olds, often as little as $35,000, although players who are called up to the N.B.A. can earn more. While 18-year-olds can play in the G League now, few have taken that route given the low pay on offer. The $125,000 salary should prove more attractive. Players in the N.B.A., of course, can earn millions of dollars. Deandre Ayton, who spent one year at Arizona before being drafted No. 1 over all, will earn more than $8 million this season. The change is part of the continued evolution of the N.B.A.’s development league into one that can compete seriously with top European leagues for talent. The development league has long offered the best shot at getting onto an N.B.A. roster — when an N.B.A. player is injured, it is much easier for an N.B.A. team to sign a player already in the United States — but the pay has been minuscule. N.B.A. players have been critical of the one-and-done rule, saying it unfairly prevents players with the ability to play in the N.B.A. from earning income. Condoleezza Rice, chairwoman of the Commission on College Basketball, said this spring that the one-and-done rule should go. A few players, including Brandon Jennings and Emmanuel Mudiay, have chosen to play overseas rather than spend a year in college. LaVar Ball, the father of the Lakers player Lonzo Ball, started the Junior Basketball Association to provide another option for such players. The first class eligible for the program includes current high school stars like Anthony Edwards of Atlanta and Jaden McDaniels of Washington State. A few of them have selected a college, but many are still uncommitted. Players like that may soon be canceling their visits to Duke and Kentucky and instead be plying their trade for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants or the Capital City Go-Go.

sport Lee Smith and Harold Baines Tapped for Hall of Fame - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Lee Smith and Harold Baines Tapped for Hall of Fame Supported by Lee Smith and Harold Baines Tapped for Hall of Fame Image Lee Smith, a closer primarily for the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday.CreditCreditStephen Dunn/Getty Images By Benjamin Hoffman Dec. 9, 2018 It has become harder in recent seasons for relief pitchers to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and designated hitters have historically had an extremely high bar to clear. But Cooperstown opened its doors to both on Sunday with the election of Lee Smith and Harold Baines by the Hall of Fame’s Today’s Game Era committee. Smith, a closer primarily for the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals, was unanimously elected by the 16-person committee. Baines, a designated hitter who played primarily for the Chicago White Sox, received the minimum 12 votes required for induction. Lou Piniella, a longtime manager and outfielder, fell one vote short of election, andGeorge Steinbrenner, Orel Hershiser, Albert Belle, Joe Carter, Will Clark, Davey Johnson and Charlie Manuel all received fewer than five votes. Smith’s Hall of Fame case relied almost exclusively on saves and reputation. He had 478 saves in 18 seasons, with a 2.93 E.R.A. that was 32 percent better than average when adjusted for his home park and the era. He struck out 1,251 batters in 1289⅓ innings but had just 29.0 career wins above replacement. Image Harold Baines is just the second player to gain induction to the Hall after spending more than 50 percent of his career as a designated hitter.CreditOtto Greule Jr/Getty Images Baines, who had 2,866 hits in 22 seasons, is the second Hall of Famer, after Frank Thomas, to have played more than 50 percent of his games at designated hitter. Baines drove in 1,628 runs and scored 1,299 while hitting 384 home runs. He batted .289 for his career, with a .356 on-base percentage, .465 slugging percentage and 38.7 WAR. Both were wildly popular players, especially in Chicago, but the decision by the Hall’s board-appointed panel — which included the longtime White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, as well as the Hall members Greg Maddux, Roberto Alomar, Joe Morgan, Bert Blyleven, Pat Gillick, Tony La Russa, John Schuerholz, Ozzie Smith and Joe Torre — served as a stark contrast to that of the Baseball Writers Association of America, which never came close to electing either player when they were eligible on the Hall’s main ballot. Smith stayed on the writers’ ballot for 15 seasons, the maximum at the time, with a low vote share of 29.9 percent and a high of 50.6 percent, well short of the 75 percent needed for election. Baines was on the ballot just five times, never receiving more than 6.1 percent. He fell off the ballot after he failed to get 5 percent of the vote in 2011. With Smith and Baines set for induction in July, there could be a relatively crowded field of closers and designated hitters. Mariano Rivera, the Yankees’ longtime relief ace, is considered a lock on the writers’ ballot thanks to his stellar postseason résumé. Edgar Martinez, who is widely considered baseball’s finest pure D.H., has an excellent shot at election after receiving 70.4 percent on last year’s ballot. The results of the writers’ election will be released on Jan. 22.

sport Washington's Josh Johnson said he played 'Madden' to learn roster Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Washington's Josh Johnson: I played 'Madden' to learn my teammates' names Shalise Manza YoungYahoo SportsDecember 10, 2018, 5:16 PM GMT When you’re a player who joins a team midway through the season, there’s a lot you have to learn. How to get from your temporary digs to the facility is No. 1, and there’s Waze for that. Scroll to continue with content Ad Learning the playbook is obviously No. 2, especially if you want to get on the field. There’s coaches and iPads for that. And if you’re invested in learning who you’re sharing a locker room with, well, there’s a method for that too. Josh Johnson gets assist from ‘Madden’ Washington quarterback Josh Johnson wanted to learn his new teammates, so he clicked on the video game console. (AP) After Washington’s 40-16 loss to the New York Giants, quarterback Josh Johnson told reporters that he played the “Madden” video game to help him learn his teammates’ names. “I had to play ‘Madden,'” he said. “I told the coaches that. Just to learn my teammates. Coming in on a short week, you learn. There’s so many moving parts, but for me, I play ‘Madden’ so I was able to get on ‘Madden’ and learn my teammates.” Washington is the 12th team Johnson has spent time with since he was drafted in 2008, so he certainly has a lot of experience learning on the fly. Josh Johnson stepped in under difficult circumstances. And he played Madden this week to learn his teammates' names. 😳 pic.twitter.com/9zJEngwKQB — NBC Sports Redskins (@NBCSRedskins) December 10, 2018 Charity hoops to practice field Johnson was playing in a charity basketball game in his native Oakland, California, when he got the call from Washington last week that it wanted to sign him; he was one of several quarterbacks the team brought in for a tryout a couple of weeks ago, after Alex Smith’s devastating injury. Story continues At the time, those players were auditioning to be Colt McCoy’s backup. But McCoy also suffered a broken leg, so the player initially signed to be the No. 2 quarterback, Mark Sanchez, became the starter. Johnson was signed to be Sanchez’s backup. Sanchez was so bad on Sunday against the Giants — he had a passer rating of 10.7 after completing 6-of-14 passes for 38 yards and two interceptions — that Johnson finished the game and will start Sunday, on the road against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

sport Xander Schauffele Wins Tournament of Champions, Tying Course Record - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Xander Schauffele Wins Tournament of Champions, Tying Course Record Supported by Xander Schauffele Wins Tournament of Champions, Tying Course Record Image Xander Schauffele making the winning birdie putt on No. 18 at the Tournament of Champions on Sunday.CreditCreditKevin C. Cox/Getty Images By The Associated Press Jan. 6, 2019 KAPALUA, Hawaii — Xander Schauffele never had a better round or a more peculiar ending. After holing out for two eagles, and closing with four birdies over his last five holes for an 11-under 62, he chose to wait inside the scoring trailer to see if it would be enough to beat Gary Woodland in the Tournament of Champions on Sunday. The trailer was just behind the grandstands on the 18th hole. The television had a 10-second delay. He heard sighs. He heard radio traffic. About the time he figured out that he won, he saw Woodland’s birdie putt to force a playoff slide by on the right. “So it was a bit strange,” Schauffele said. “But the day was awesome.” Schauffele took another step toward joining the young elite in golf with his second victory this season, and fourth in the last 18 months. He already has two multiple-win seasons in his third year on the PGA Tour. He moved to No. 6 in the world. “This is the stuff you dream about,” Schauffele said. “But to actually pull it off, it feels awesome. I could see myself doing it, but it’s hard to believe just sitting here and talking about it.” In all four of his victories, he had to rally on the final day. Kapalua presented the biggest deficit at five shots. He delivered a record-tying round. He started with a bogey and figured he had nothing to lose. Before long, he was in position to win. He ran off three straight birdies. He chipped in from the front of the green on the par-5 ninth for eagle. He holed a wedge from 107 yards for another eagle on No. 12. He took his first lead with birdies on the 14th and 15th holes, both times coming close to chipping in for eagle. Tied with Woodland over the closing holes, Schauffele finished birdie-birdie, tying the course record held by four other players. “It was a crazy day,” Schauffele said. “I knew it was going to be a birdie fest at the end. We kept our head down and made a run for it.” Image Gary Woodland missed his birdie putt on No. 18 and finished second, one stroke behind.CreditKevin C. Cox/Getty Images Woodland had a chance to force a playoff, but he hit his drive on the par-5 18th so far — 390 yards downhill but into a Kona wind — that he was between clubs. He tried to draw a hard 4-iron and left it out to the right, hit a pitch-and-run to 10 feet and missed the birdie putt. It was a tough loss for Woodland. He started the final round with a three-shot lead and closed with a bogey-free 68. He never shot worse than 68 all week and was the only player in the winners-only field to have all four rounds in the 60s. It still was not enough. “This one will sting,” Woodland said. Schauffele, a 25-year-old Californian, was in the group ahead of him, and Woodland could see as he went after the left flag on the tough 17th hole with a 6-iron to just inside 10 feet and then made birdie. Woodland hit his approach to just inside 12 feet, and made birdie to move back into a tie. Schauffele was not finished. He hammered a 5-wood onto the green at the 18th to about 12 feet, narrowly missing his third eagle of the final round. He rolled it in for his 62 to finish at 23-under 269, and then had to wait. Before long, he had a lei around his neck and the trophy in his hands, along with one other perk. “It means I get to come back, which is even better,” Schauffele said. Justin Thomas closed with a 65 to finish alone in third, five shots back. Woodland said he could not think of much he did wrong except to not take advantage of a few pins he could have played to more aggressively. But he found no consolation in losing to a guy who shot 62 in the tougher of the two wind directions on the west end of Maui. “I don’t think it will ever be easy because I still believe I was playing well enough to shoot 66 today,” Woodland said. “You have an iron into the par 5 in the middle of the fairway on the last hole, you expect to make birdie. I had killed the par 5s all week this week, which is what you’ve got to do out here. So I knew what he was doing and the competitor in me knew I needed to do one better. And unfortunately, I didn’t get it done.” Neither did Rory McIlroy. He played in the final group with Woodland, three shots behind, knowing he had played in the final group six times last year without winning. He moved to two shots behind early, but did not make a birdie after a two-putt on the par-5 fifth and closed with a 72 to tie for fourth at 277 with Dustin Johnson (67) and Marc Leishman (71). “I gave myself plenty of chances, just couldn’t get anything to drop,” McIlroy said. Brooks Koepka closed with a 69 to finish 24th, meaning Justin Rose returns to No. 1 in the world.

He made a Pro Bowl as a rookie for his work as a kick returner. He won’t like watching the film of his kickoff return late in the first half on Saturday night, when Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher tackled him. Scroll to continue with content Ad Maher made one of those hidden plays that can be forgotten in a big game, but makes a big difference. After Dallas took a 10-6 lead late in the first half, Maher kicked off to Lockett. Lockett hit the seam and shot into the open field. Cowboys safety Jeff Heath looked like the last obstacle, and he was being blocked. It looked like Lockett might take it the distance. Then Maher, a rookie who had a nice season replacing Dan Bailey, made a heck of a play. He got the right angle and tripped up Lockett at the Dallas 49-yard line. Without that tackle, Lockett might have scored a touchdown. At very least, he would have been deeper into Cowboys territory and in field-goal range. In the final seconds of the first half the Seahawks got a few yards to set up Sebastian Janikowski on a 57-yard field-goal attempt. But Janikowski missed the long attempt, and because he had to put full effort into the kick, he injured his hamstring. He was ruled out for the second half a few minutes into the third quarter, leaving punter Michael Dickson as the team’s kicker. Instead of Lockett either breaking what would have been an enormous touchdown, or at least setting up Janikowski for a short field goal, Maher came up with a great tackle, the Seahawks didn’t score again before halftime and Janikowski injured his leg. It might not show up on the highlight reel, but a kicker’s tackle might have been the biggest play of the first half in Dallas’ wild-card playoff game. Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher (2) hit a field goal and also made a huge tackle in the first half against the Seahawks.

sport Yankees Taking a Chance on Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Yankees Taking a Chance on Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki Supported by Yankees Taking a Chance on Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki Image Troy Tulowitzki played in 66 games for the Blue Jays in 2017, hitting seven home runs while batting .249, before missing all of 2018.CreditCreditFrank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press By Billy Witz Jan. 2, 2019 There was a time when the Yankees landing Troy Tulowitzki would have been trumpeted — an All-Star shortstop treading the same patch of Yankee Stadium dirt as his boyhood idol, Derek Jeter. Now, though, the union carries more pragmatism than pomp. The Yankees need a shortstop to replace the injured Didi Gregorius for several months, and Tulowitzki, who has missed a year and half with injuries and was released by the Toronto Blue Jays last month, needs a place to resurrect his career. And so the Yankees are taking a low-risk flier, signing Tulowitzki to a one-year, major-league-minimum contract, pending a physical. The agreement, first reported by ESPN late Tuesday night, was confirmed by a baseball official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal until it is completed. The agreement does not preclude the Yankees from signing the free-agent infielder Manny Machado, but it does give an indication that they have reservations about meeting an asking price that is expected to be in the 10-year, $300 million range. Machado met with the Yankees, the Chicago White Sox and the Philadelphia Phillies before Christmas. Tulowitzki, 34, was once considered one of the best shortstops in baseball, earning National League Gold Gloves and Silver Slugger Awards in 2010 and 2011. But since then, he has struggled to stay healthy, and his performance has suffered. Four times in the last seven seasons, Tulowitzki has played 91 games or fewer. When he stepped on the foot of Los Angeles Angels first baseman C. J. Cron midway through the 2017 season, he injured ankle ligaments badly enough that he missed the remainder of the year. At the time, he was carrying a .678 on-base plus slugging percentage, his worst since he made his major league debut at age 21 in 2006. Then, last spring, he had bone spurs removed from both heels and ended up missing the entire 2018 season. Toronto released Tulowitzki on Dec. 11, eating the final $38 million on his contract. The Yankees will pay him the minimum, $555,000, which will be deducted from the $20 million the Blue Jays owe him this season. If Tulowitzki is the opening-day shortstop, it will allow the Yankees to keep Gleyber Torres at second base, where he excelled last season as a rookie. In searching for a temporary replacement for Gregorius, who is expected to miss three to five months while recovering from Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, the Yankees had been open to moving Torres to shortstop, if they found a second baseman who was a better fit.

sport Brian Cashman Says Yankees Want No Part of the Bryce Harper Sweepstakes - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Brian Cashman Says Yankees Want No Part of the Bryce Harper Sweepstakes Supported by Brian Cashman Says Yankees Want No Part of the Bryce Harper Sweepstakes Image Bryce Harper is considered the top free-agent outfielder on the market, but he does not fill a need for the Yankees.CreditCreditKelly Kline/Getty Images By Billy Witz Dec. 10, 2018 LAS VEGAS — As Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman continued to kick the tires on free agents and trade proposals that might bring him a coveted starting pitcher, an injury replacement for shortstop Didi Gregorius and some bullpen fortifications, the only news he relayed Monday was what would not be happening. Bryce Harper won’t be walking through that clubhouse door. After a series of questions about Harper — the magnetic, 26-year-old star who turned down a $300 million from the Washington Nationals to become a free agent — Cashman went from bemused to incredulous. “At no time at all — all winter — did I say I’m looking for an outfielder,” Cashman said, speaking in his suite here in Las Vegas to a group of reporters who cover the Yankees. “So the Harper stuff — I’m surprised you’re still asking.” Such a swift, public dismissal of his interest in a player whose personality and game seem so finely tailored to the Yankees and their brand was the Yankees’ latest, and perhaps most forceful, attempt to distance themselves from the way they once operated under George Steinbrenner. The rejection of interest served as a continuation of a desultory December for Steinbrenner, the former Yankees owner who died in 2010 — he was rejected by the Hall of Fame’s Today’s Game Era committee for induction on Sunday, and the Yankees recently lost out in the bidding for the top free-agent pitcher Patrick Corbin. In the past, the Yankees might have been happy to accommodate the suggestion of Harper’s agent, Scott Boras, that he is quite capable of playing first base — just like they entertained the idea of a previous Boras client, Alex Rodriguez, playing third base. But not now. “It’s not something that we would play on at that level and that type of money,” Cashman said, all but waving the possibility away with the back of his hand. Cashman’s point was that the Yankees have built themselves into one of the best teams in baseball — if still a shade behind the last two World Series champions, the Houston Astros and the Boston Red Sox — in a deliberate, thoughtful manner. They have rebuilt their minor-league development program, astutely assessed which prospects to hold onto and which to deal, and plucked diamonds in the rough, like center fielder Aaron Hicks and Gregorius, and perhaps first baseman Luke Voit, in exchange for superfluous parts. Image Brian Cashman speaking to reporters in November at baseball’s general manager meetings. CreditGregory Bull/Associated Press To Cashman, it has all come together through organizational synergy — the scouting, development, analytics, sports science and coaching staff members all working in sync. So, just because the Yankees were valued by Forbes at $4 billion last April and were shedding more than $50 million in payroll at the end of last season, did not mean they were going to splurge on an extravagance like Harper or a finishing touch like Corbin. There will be no irrational exuberance. If the Yankees used to regularly bid against themselves for free agents, now their view might be summed up thus: a price tag is a price tag. “I don’t believe we need to abandon the successful, organized detailed process because now we’re knocking on the door,” Cashman said. “It doesn’t mean all of the sudden you become haphazard, or just reactive or emotional. I think, again, we’re keeping it simple.” That meant that even though they assessed Corbin as the best starting pitcher on the free-agent market — and pitching was a glaring deficiency in their playoff losses to the Astros and Red Sox the last two seasons — they did not want to give Corbin, who is 29, the sixth year on a contract that he got from the Nationals. They assigned a contract value to Corbin — five years, $100 million — and were not going to budge on the length. Cashman declined to explain why, saying it would be unfair to Corbin and the Nationals, but he did allow later that he believed there were better pitchers available on the trade market, one of them being the two-time Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber of Cleveland. Cashman was emphatic that this sort of discipline is nothing new, that the Yankees have been operating this way for a number of years. He pointed to several deals that might have looked like a step backward, but were not — trading a valuable reliever, Justin Wilson, for two minor league pitchers (one of whom turned out to be even better, Chad Green); letting closer David Robertson leave as a free agent, then getting a compensation pick and signing Andrew Miller for less; and trading Adam Warren for international pool money. “It’s convenient and an easy story to write about us being different than the Boss’s Yankees, but the game is completely different, too,” Cashman said, referring to luxury tax penalties that also include losing draft picks. “I think we’ve been operating in a different capacity because it’s a whole new world order.” But those deals were made largely around the margins of the roster. The more memorable ones have reshaped a roster. When the Yankees missed the playoffs in 2008, they lavished huge contracts on C.C. Sabathia, Mark Teixeira and A.J. Burnett and all played a role in their championship the following season. It has been a decade, though, and as Cashman has been reminding, much has changed. But for those who cannot dismiss the old feeling that, after being outbid for Corbin and passing on Harper, there will be another, reactive, pinstriped shoe to drop this winter, there is this: Cashman said on Monday that he has had several meetings with the agent Dan Lozano to discuss one of his clients — Manny Machado.

sport Cowboys will try to win their first road playoff game in 26 years Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Cowboys will try to win their first road playoff game in 26 years Michael David SmithProFootball Talk on NBC SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 11:00 AM GMT The Cowboys will try to do something next weekend that they haven’t done in 26 years: Win on the road in the playoffs. Dallas will head to either Los Angeles or New Orleans, depending on the result of today’s Eagles-Bears game, and attempt to snap the franchise’s seven-game road playoff losing streak. Only the Lions and Browns have longer road playoff losing streaks than the Cowboys. The last time the Cowboys won a postseason game on the road was in January of 1993, when the Cowboys beat the 49ers 30-20 in the NFC Championship Game at Candlestick Park. That game saw Troy Aikman throw for 322 yards and Emmitt Smith run for 114 yards. The Cowboys will need Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott to have similarly productive games if they’re to beat the Rams or Saints on the road. Dallas will certainly be an underdog next weekend, but perhaps this can be the Cowboys team to snap that long road playoff losing streak.

sport The Tiny Club, the Giant Stadium and the Deal Driving Them Apart - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Soccer Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Soccer|The Tiny Club, the Giant Stadium and the Deal Driving Them Apart Supported by The Tiny Club, the Giant Stadium and the Deal Driving Them Apart Queen’s Park is Scotland’s oldest soccer team and shaped how the sport is played. It has called the national stadium, Hampden Park, its home. But that is about to end. Image Hampden Park, in Glasgow, has long been a regular stop for the teams in Scotland's lower leagues who come to play Queen's Park F.C.CreditCreditKieran Dodds for The New York Times By Rory Smith Dec. 21, 2018 GLASGOW — As a lifelong fan, a historian, and a former president of Queen’s Park F.C., Jim Hastie has been to enough home games to notice the pattern. The same thing, he says, happens every time: Long before kickoff, long before the Queen’s Park players have left their dressing room, long before it is necessary, the visiting team will emerge, ready to go through its warm-up routine. For most players and for most games, the warm-up is a chore to be completed, a box to tick before the real business of the game starts. When a team travels to Queen’s Park, though, it is different. Here, the visitors dawdle a little over their stretches, passing exercises and sprinting drills. When they are summoned back inside, they stroll, rather than jog. They find myriad ways to spend as much time as possible on the field, savoring their surroundings, the moment. It does not matter that the stadium, designed to hold 52,000 fans, will attract only a few hundred for today’s game against Annan Athletic, or that there may well be more people in the wedding fair being held in one of the executive suites than there are watching the game. This is still a day Annan’s players will remember: the time they played at Hampden Park. Hampden has always led a dual life. As the home of the Scottish national team, stage for the country’s cup finals and one of Europe’s elite stadiums, it has long been regarded as one of the game’s great stages. It was here that 150,000 people watched Scotland play England in 1937; it was here that Zinedine Zidane scored perhaps the finest goal in Champions League history in 2002. It has also, though, long been a regular stop for the teams in Scotland’s lower leagues who come to face Queen’s Park, in matches when its stands are all but empty, its famous roar no more than a whisper. Queen’s Park is Scotland’s oldest club, and historically perhaps its most significant. Uniquely in the Scottish leagues, it remains resolutely amateur, run by a few hundred members, staffed largely by a few dozen volunteers — like Hastie — and represented on the field by a team paid only its expenses. It has spent much of its recent past bouncing around the lower reaches of Scotland’s four divisions. It also calls Hampden Park home — for now, at least: In 2020, Queen’s Park, the club that owns this place, the club that built it more than a century ago, is being forced out. Image Scotland tied England at Hampden Park in 1923.CreditHulton Archive, via Getty Images Last year, the Scottish Football Association announced that it was reviewing its relationship with Hampden. For more than a century, Scotland has played here, essentially as a tenant of Queen’s Park: initially on short-term staging agreements and then, more recently, under long-term leases, usually agreed to depending on certain improvements to the stadium. The current lease is set to expire in 2020 — after that year’s European Championship, for which Hampden will be one of a dozen host sites — and the S.F.A. let it be known that it was keen to explore its options. It was offered the chance to move games to Murrayfield, in Edinburgh, the home of the Scottish rugby team. Celtic and Rangers, Glasgow’s twin giants, proposed alternating games between their stadiums, Celtic Park and Ibrox. Some wanted the national team to play across Scotland. Eventually, the S.F.A. determined that the best option was to buy Hampden from Queen’s Park. A deal — a £5 million cash payment (about $6.3 million), and the assumption of around £19 million in liabilities — was agreed upon, though the S.F.A. had to rely on £1 million donations from two of the country’s richest men to conjure the funds. It seemed a surprisingly low price for a 33-acre plot of prime real estate in Glasgow’s South Side, a 10-minute drive from the city center. A survey commissioned by Queen’s Park during the talks estimated the land alone was worth around £28 million, even without the stadium. But Queen’s Park did not have much of a choice. Its rental income from the S.F.A. accounts for £300,000 of its £750,000 revenue each season. “It doesn’t take a genius” to see that Scotland’s leaving would have had dire consequences for the club, Hastie said. Image Hampden Park holds more than 50,000 fans, but Queen’s Park regularly attracts crowds in the hundreds.CreditKieran Dodds for The New York Times Image Queen’s Park has 10 Scottish Cup titles on its résumé but its current fans never saw them; the last came in 1893.CreditKieran Dodds for The New York Times The deal was done. Starting in 2020, Queen’s Park will no longer play at Hampden Park, bringing to an end some 150 years of history. Instead, it will use the £5 million payment to refurbish Lesser Hampden — its community and administrative facility in the shadow of the main stadium — as its new home. Outside Queen’s Park, few doubted that the right decision had been reached. Hampden is Scotland’s “spiritual home,” as the former national manager Craig Brown and Kenny Dalglish, perhaps its finest player, said. And though the thought of the team’s leaving was, to many, anathema, the fate of a minor fourth-division team was, at best, a secondary consideration. That is not quite how they see it at Queen’s Park. Gerry Crawley, the club president, acknowledged that leaving for Lesser Hampden was “not a situation we sought,” though he said he was confident the £5 million would be enough to create a new home on the existing training complex there and allow the team to “operate in a similar manner.” Others are more fearful. Keith McAllister, 61, has been attending Queen’s Park games for almost three decades. He grew up a few streets away. He estimates that he has missed only three away matches since 1979. He has, he said, warned his daughter that if she marries during the season, it will have to be on a Friday. For home games, he runs a souvenir stall in Hampden Park. Most weeks, he said, he will have a handful of foreign visitors paying homage to Queen’s Park. “There are a lot who come up from England, but I’ve had people from Spain and Germany, too,” he said. They come not just because of the litany of famous players this club has produced — like Alex Ferguson, now a life member, and Andy Robertson, Liverpool defender and current Scotland captain — but because of its contribution to the game as a whole. Indeed, perhaps more than any other club, Queen’s Park helped to craft soccer as it is played today. Image Zinedine Zidane, right, and Real Madrid won the Champions League final at Hampden in 2002.CreditGary Prior/Getty Images Image Scotland's football association, which has held national team matches at Hampden for decades, will take control of it by 2020. CreditMike Hewitt/Getty Images Though the game was first codified in England, for much of the 19th century it remained at heart a “hacking and dribbling” game: Players would run with the ball until they were brought down, by fair means or foul. Queen’s Park is credited with the creation of what it called the “combination” game and what became known, south of the border, as the “Scottish style.” This is the club that invented passing. “There is a degree of truth in that,” Hastie said. “Queen’s Park introduced that method of play, and they changed the system to go along with it. In terms of style, Queen’s — and Scotland — were ahead. England was behind the times.” Twice, in the 1880s, Queen’s Park reached the English F.A. Cup final, the only Scottish club ever to do so. In several of the very earliest international matches, Queen’s stood in for Scotland. “That’s why the great English teams of the 1880s and 1890s all signed Scottish players,” Hastie said. That group of expatriates, drawn south by Preston, Sunderland and Liverpool, among others, became known as the Scots Professors. Many in Glasgow, then, think this is a club that should be cherished by Scotland, seen as a source of pride. Instead, as it faces ejection from its home, they believe there is a risk it may fall into decay, or even cease to exist. “What other country would do this, with a team that has done more than any other for the game’s history?” McAllister said. “At one point, this was the best football team in the world. It is a sad thing for football, and this is a football-mad city, but the attitude is that it’s only Queen’s Park. The club will survive, but it will not be what it was.” Image "Queen’s and Hampden are intrinsically linked,” the former club president Jim Hastie said. “It is our whole history, our reason for being."CreditKieran Dodds for The New York Times Hastie shares that concern. These days, he said, Queen’s Park’s selling point is as a hub for youth development: It attracts players not by offering to pay them, but by providing the “best facilities, the best coaching” outside Celtic and Rangers. The path laid down by Liverpool’s Robertson is a part of that lure — “everyone here wants to wear the No. 3 shirt” in his honor, Hastie said — but so, too, is the opportunity to call Hampden home. Leaving, then, delivers a double blow: Queen’s Park’s eight youth teams are based at Lesser Hampden, and it is not entirely clear when or where they will play if that facility is remade to house the first team. That — together with the loss of the unique chance to play every other week at the national stadium — could undo much of Queen’s Park’s good work. What worries them most, though, is something less tangible. To those who have spent their lives following Queen’s Park, or working for Queen’s Park, Hampden is a central part of the club’s identity. This spot has been its home for 115 years. It has been its owner, its developer, its protector. At times, as Hastie said, it has felt like an “unfortunate custodian.” They know that the time has come to sell, to downsize. But some of the club’s members hoped, perhaps, to be allowed to remain as tenants, as guests of the S.F.A. They fear that by moving on completely, Queen’s Park is leaving behind a little of its soul, a little of itself, in the bricks and mortar and empty seats of Hampden Park. “Queen’s and Hampden are intrinsically linked,” Hastie said. “It is our whole history, our reason for being. If we lose Hampden, we lose our status as a national institution. We lose everything.” Image Queen's Park has grown accustomed to playing at Hampden, but it remains a treat for its amateur-league opponents.CreditKieran Dodds for The New York Times Rory Smith is the chief soccer correspondent, based in Manchester, England.

He returned with 5:20 to play. Apparently, he could have returned sooner. Coach Mike Tomlin provided a confusing explanation to reporters after the game regarding the decision to hold Ben until late in the fourth quarter.

We were waiting to see if he was going to be able to come back in  — he was. Probably could have come in a series or so sooner. But we were in the rhythm and flow of the game. He was ready to go when he got back out there.” Implicit in the response is that the Steelers specifically held Roethlisberger out, not that he was resisting coming back in the game.

sport Vikings could have hard time hiring an offensive coordinator Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Vikings could have hard time hiring an offensive coordinator Mike FlorioProFootball Talk on NBC SportsJanuary 5, 2019, 4:27 PM GMT Thursday’s press conference from Vikings coach Mike Zimmer was eventful, for a variety of reasons. Beyond vowing to restore the “nasty” to a team that allowed its expectations to be set too high for 2018 (and that seemed to believe it would be far easier to get back to the final four than it was), explaining the very real connection between the passing of Tony Sparano and the team’s overall struggles, and discussing what Zimmer learned from the misfired hiring of John DeFilippo to be the successor to offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, Zimmer shrugged at the fact that his contract is set to expire after the 2019 season. He shouldn’t. Scroll to continue with content Ad With no security beyond 2019, Zimmer necessarily will have a harder time getting his first choice to run the offense for the coming season. While the candidate surely would be offered a multi-year deal, stepping into what seems to be a one-year, up-or-out mandate is hardly ideal. The Vikings can fix this by giving Zimmer an extension now. The fact that Zimmer doesn’t have one, while largely downplayed by the media, threatens to hover over the franchise in a negative way throughout the offseason and into 2019. Yes, plenty of teams have been in this posture. But given that Zimmer is a defensive expert and given the critical importance of finding someone who can take the various pieces of the Minnesota offense and make it all work immediately (even if he won’t be able to meet with his players until April), the intense pressure coupled with the very real prospect of not only being a one-year resident of Minnesota but also the linchpin for the ongoing employment of the rest of the coaching staff makes it a job that offensive coaches with choices won’t be included to choose to accept.

Drafted last June with the Mets’ highest pick in 15 years, Kelenic is the No. 62 prospect on MLB.com’s top 100 list. Dunn ranks 89th. That is impressive, but no guarantee of future stardom. Two years ago at the winter meetings, the Boston Red Sox weighed the risk of trading four prospects to the Chicago White Sox for the All-Star left-hander Chris Sale. Included in the package would be a second baseman, Yoan Moncada, who ranked second on MLB.com’s list, and the pitcher Michael Kopech, who ranked 16th. Dave Dombrowski, the Red Sox’ veteran general manager, made the winning argument. The instinct to do so should eventually carry Dombrowski to the Hall of Fame. “There was a lot of debate and dialogue, a lot of worry about Moncada and Kopech and all these prospects,” said Sam Kennedy, the Red Sox president, during the American League Championship Series this October. “And his answer was, ‘Yeah, but we’re getting Chris Sale.’ It’s like, ‘Good point.’” A week after Kennedy spoke, Sale whipped a slider past Manny Machado to win the World Series at Dodger Stadium. As for Moncada and Kopech, they learned that the path to stardom is rarely easy. Moncada struck out 217 times and hit only 17 homers; no player in major league history had ever fanned so often while going deep so infrequently. Kopech made four starts and needed Tommy John surgery. As a reliever, Diaz is not as valuable as Sale, a starter who made a bullpen cameo to seal Boston’s title. But he might be the best closer in the majors, having converting 57 of 61 save opportunities for the Mariners last season with a 1.96 E.R.A. and 15.2 strikeouts per nine innings. If the trade goes through, the Mets will control his rights through 2022. Image Robinson Cano has a .304 batting average over 14 professional seasons.CreditMichael Ainsworth/Associated Press In theory, the Mets could have signed a closer in free agency, kept their prospects and not bothered with Cano, who is 36 years old and served an 80-game suspension last season for a positive drug test. But Cano might have something left. He batted .317 in 41 games after returning from his suspension, and hitting is just what he does. As soon as Cano reached the majors, with the Yankees in 2005, Manager Joe Torre compared him to Rod Carew, the Hall of Famer with 3,053 career hits. Cano is not far behind with 2,470 hits — and a lot more thump, however he achieves it. The Mets need hits; they ranked 29th out of 30 teams in hits last season, ahead of only the Philadelphia Phillies. Brodie Van Wagenen, the Mets’ new general manager, is Cano’s former agent. That he would put so much faith in his former client, knowing his baggage, underscores his confidence in Cano. The Mets hired Van Wagenen to be bold, not cautious, and bold can mean reckless. Van Wagenen was aggressive by necessity in his former line of work — nobody hires an agent to tank — and so he is again. He sold the Mets’ chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon, on a vision of winning now. Raiding the farm system for a closer and an aging, expensive infielder is the ultimate win-now move. Should the Mets now replenish the system by trading Noah Syndergaard and signing a veteran replacement like J.A. Happ? Ruben Amaro Jr., one of three assistants to Van Wagenen with experience as a general manager, could remind his boss of the perils of such a move. With the Phillies in 2009, Amaro traded three prospects to Toronto for Roy Halladay and simultaneously acquired three prospects from Seattle for Cliff Lee. The best of those six prospects was Travis d’Arnaud, who went from the Phillies to the Blue Jays to, eventually, the Mets — who now want to replace him. Halladay and Lee, of course, continued being Halladay and Lee. Unscientifically, teams tend to need at least three top prospects to unearth a star. The Mets have picked first in the draft five times. Only one of their choices, Darryl Strawberry, became an All-Star. Like Strawberry, Kelenic was the first high school player picked in his draft. He may become a star, but not for several years. By then, the Mets may have missed the window of contention with this core: a rotation of Jacob deGrom, Syndergaard, Zack Wheeler and Steven Matz and an outfield of Michael Conforto, Brandon Nimmo and the injured Yoenis Cespedes. They need more than Cano, Diaz and those seven players to have a realistic chance at contending in the National League East. But this move clearly heralds more to come; they still need better setup men and better hitters, especially those who bat right-handed. Reinvesting in a flawed team may prove to be a colossal mistake, and the Mets assume far greater risk in this deal than the rebuilding Mariners, who probably never dreamed of unloading so much of Cano’s bloated contract. While the Mets will help themselves by shedding the salaries of Bruce and Swarzak, they will owe a staggering $100 million to Cano for five years. By the end of his contract, Cano will be 40 and Kelenic and Dunn could be low-cost, high-impact players for Seattle. But the Mets will worry about 2023 when it comes. With roster teardowns in vogue across baseball, they should be commended, at least, for trying to win. That might be a low bar, but the Mets have cleared it. Now comes the hard part.

sport NBA dancers reveal decades-long culture of 'brainwashing' Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? NBA dancers reveal decades-long culture of 'brainwashing,' unfair pay and eating disorders Abby HaglageYahoo LifestyleDecember 10, 2018, 11:30 AM GMT NBA dancers, from left: Sydney Sorenson, Utah Jazz; Chenise Johnson, Orlando Magic; Alanna Sarabia, San Antonio Spurs; Chenelle Young, Utah Jazz; Madison Murray, Phoenix Suns; Kathryn Dunn, Dallas Mavericks; Ana Ogbueze, Charlotte Hornets; Lisa Murray, Golden State Warriors; Lauren Herington, Milwaukee Bucks. (Collage: Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle) Of all the things that Lauren Herington remembers about her year as an NBA dancer, it’s the broom closet that rattles her most. “My coach would make me sit in there before games and think about if I was doing everything to be able to lose weight,” Lauren, a dancer for the Milwaukee Bucks from 2013 to 2014, recalls for Yahoo Lifestyle. “You know, basically like a child in time-out.” When her coach thought she looked “questionable” weight-wise, Lauren says, she’d instruct the dancer to put on her spandex uniform in order to perform a “jiggle test” in front of the team. “She’d come up and grab underneath my butt or the side of my belly,” Lauren, then 18, remembers. “She’d be like, ‘Lose 5 pounds by tomorrow, and you’ll be fine.’” Scroll to continue with content Ad While Lauren is opening up here for the first time about the full range of bullying she says she faced at the hands of her coach (the Bucks told Yahoo Lifestyle that they take all of the allegations “very seriously” but “have found no evidence to support these claims”), the Illinois native is no stranger to speaking out. In 2015, she brought a class-action lawsuit against the Milwaukee Bucks, alleging that the dancers — after covering costs of required beauty routines like spray tans and manicures — were effectively paid as little as $3-$4 an hour (according to interviews with her lawyers). The Bucks, a team that brought in $87 million in revenue that year, “strongly denied” the claims but agreed to settle, paying a total of $250,000 in lost wages to roughly 40 dancers. Lauren spoke openly to the press at the time, explaining how the weight restrictions left her “dehydrating and starving” herself to fit into the uniform, and waitressing at Ruby Tuesday to pay the bills.  Story continues Her story — then and now — ran in stark contrast to the public images of NBA dancers, 20 or so per team, who seem to ooze effortless glamour and beauty. Elite athletes in their own right, they strut onto the court at halftime with the pluck and poise of a Broadway ensemble. They appear on Instagram, sparkling in sequins, and on Facebook, kicking in heels. They’re fierce but polished, with near-constant smiles. But — much like the lawsuits filed by NFL cheerleaders in recent months — Lauren’s account suggests that the joyous vibe could be masking something darker.  The NFL cheerleader lawsuits — which were preceded by multiple New York Times exposés on the topic — cite claims of unfair pay, gender discrimination and sexual harassment. While it’s too soon to know the impact that those lawsuits will have on the NFL, their existence alone is monumental and signals a major cultural change. So too do many stories told to Yahoo Lifestyle, which conducted interviews with 15 women who have danced for the NBA, over years spanning 1997 to 2018. What we found through these personal stories — in which young, ambitious talents described being mandated to lose weight, being paid less per game than the price of a single ticket, and generally being taken advantage of in a league worth hundreds of billions — was that Lauren’s claims weren’t the exception. They were just the tip of the iceberg. Photo: Getty Images; graphics: Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle ‘America’s sport’ To understand the stories of these women, it’s important to take a look at the sports behemoth that employs them. The National Basketball Association, which dates back to 1949, wields monumental power: With 450 players and 30 teams, each one of them — as of 2018 — worth over $1 billion, it’s one of the most lucrative sports empires of all time. Thanks in part to superstars like LeBron James and Steph Curry, plus a forward-thinking stance on gender and race, the league has earned a cultlike following that grows each year. In 2017 alone, the league’s 1,200-plus games attracted more than a billion TV viewers, 21 million attendees and A-list celebrities in courtside seats nationwide. The fanbase has become so vast, in fact, that analysts have begun predicting that the NBA will soon eclipse the NFL’s fanbase, stealing the coveted moniker of “America’s sport.” And the NBA dancers, whether most people realize it or not, play no small part in it all. The squads’ arrival on courts in the late 1970s helped transform NBA games from mere sports events to “showtime,” a term coined by the Lakers owner who first introduced the idea of dancers, Jerry Buss. “My dad understood from the beginning that the key to make the Lakers appealing was equal parts sports and entertainment,” Buss’s daughter Jeanie wrote in her 2010 book, Laker Girl. “After 31 years, the party is still going on.” If you’re an NBA dancer, though, that all depends on your perspective — which starts forming the moment an audition for a coveted spot on a squad begins. While the details vary, the main ingredients seem to be the same: a multiday tryout complete with choreographed dance routines, in-person interviews and a fitness assessment, which is a vital component in the decision about whether a dancer will make the team. Hence the audition attire: form-fitting outfits that often verge on bikinis. The audition scene — which can be glimpsed in pictures and videos dating back a decade and as recently as this year — is striking, with hundreds of women dancing in perfect unison while judges watch and take notes. Those who make the team but don’t have the right “look” are informed immediately. Madison Murray danced for the Phoenix Suns from 2012 to 2015. (Image: Courtesy Madison Murray; graphics: Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle) “The night I made the team, management pulled me aside to say they were concerned about my weight,” says Alanna Sarabia, who danced for the San Antonio Spurs from 2011 to 2012 (the year the Spurs decided to disband their dance squad, opting for a “family friendly” alternative). “We were given a bin of uniforms from the year before, and I might be a solid size 6, but the girl before you might be a 2 or a 4, and that’s your uniform now — so, good luck.” Madison Murray, who danced with the Phoenix Suns from 2012 to 2015, shares a similar story. “Right after I made the team, they told me I had to lose 10 pounds,” she says. “I was probably softer than I should have been, but it still eats at you. I never felt good enough.” Madison had been in Phoenix for only a short time at that point, after having booked a one-way flight from Salt Lake City, where she’d been a dancer for the Utah Jazz. There, she says, her weight had been a constant issue, and she was hoping to have a different experience on the Suns. Instead, she found that fixation on weight among NBA dance squads was the norm. “It was my dream for 15 years, so I put it on a pedestal,” says Madison of being an NBA dancer. “I knew it would be a lot of hard work, and that never scared me, but I never knew how much of a toll it would take on my confidence. That was a really hard thing. Once you get in that position, you want to do everything you can to keep it. But it takes a toll … it was a rough life.” ‘I would say I definitely had an eating disorder’ Of course, not all of the women interviewed found the sit-down body assessment that marks the beginning of their time on the teams to be scarring. “We did weigh-ins; the coach would sit us down and go over everything — from hair to makeup to body type, full-on top and bottom,” says Ana Ogbueze, a dancer for the Charlotte Hornets (formerly the Charlotte Bobcats) from 2004 to 2008. “Because often, the way you come in and audition is the way you have to stay.” Ana, who had been inspired to try out because of her love for Paula Abdul (one of the original Laker Girls, brought in by Jerry Buss), was admittedly thrown off by the requirements — including mandatory food logs. “I was like, ‘Dang, I gotta write down everything I eat?’” she recalls. “I’d think, I don’t want to write this down because I don’t want them to think I’m eating poorly.” But Ana says her coach explained that it was simply to make her aware of what she was putting in her body, so that she could make improvements if needed. “I never felt the need to starve myself,” Ana says. Many women said that the level of body shaming seems to hinge on the dance coach — which meant a handful were lucky to have loose weight regulations. “I know that some of my peers had some diets but more for themselves; our coaches were supportive,” says Michelle Caputo, a dancer for the New York Knicks from 2005 to 2011, now the proprietor of a dance studio that acts as a feeder for the Knicks squad. A current dancer for the Detroit Pistons agrees with her: “My coach doesn’t put that type of pressure on us,” says the dancer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Chenise Johnson, a dancer for the Orlando Magic from 2017 to 2018, echoes the sentiment: “They say if you fluctuate between weights it’s completely fine. They just want to make sure you look your best.” But those who never felt pressure to be thinner, or never witnessed it, were the outliers among those who spoke with Yahoo Lifestyle. The vast majority faced regular weigh-ins, body-fat assessments or both. Nine women spoke of a practice called “weight probation” or “weight warning,” in which dancers would be benched if they appeared to be a few pounds over their “goal weight.” This, in particular, prompted several dancers to resort to dangerous measures. Sydney Sorenson danced for the Utah Jazz from 2009 to 2012. (Image: Courtesy Sydney Sorenson; graphics: Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle) “We got weighed monthly; that’s what messed with me most,” says Sydney Sorenson, a dancer for the Utah Jazz from 2009 to 2012. “[So] the week of weigh-ins, I came up with all these methods to weigh in smaller, like not eat anything solid for a week. … One year they weighed us after Thanksgiving, and a girl had gained weight and couldn’t perform,” she recalls. “Point blank, I would say that I definitely had an eating disorder — especially the last year.” (Madison, from the Suns, says she also developed an eating disorder.) “My teammates would regularly take laxatives before performances just to be able to eat regularly and still fit into this image,” a dancer from the L.A. Clippers from 2011 to 2012, who chose to remain anonymous because of her job, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “I did it a few times because it was regular, which is really sad. But it seemed so normal.” Kathryn Dunn, a Dallas Mavericks dancer from 2013 to 2016, recalls a particularly disturbing incident involving a rookie who “walked in on [another girl on the team] passed out in the bathroom … because she had been throwing up her food.” ‘Who’s deciding that women can’t be normal-sized and dance?’ Multiple women said the obsession with body image in the NBA motivated them to choose a career as a trainer or nutritionist, to work toward stopping the perpetuation of unhealthy body image. “One of my biggest goals is to empower women about their bodies,” says Chenelle Young, who danced for the Utah Jazz from 2010 to 2013 and has been directing the NBA’s international team (which travels to games in Europe) since. “I don’t think everyone thinks a tiny, 90-pound girl is sexy. … So I don’t understand why [the NBA] thinks everyone needs to be that.” Lisa Murray, a dancer for the Golden State Warriors from 2010 to 2014 (who subsequently helped craft legislation in California that guarantees dancers minimum wage), finds the focus on image “upsetting” and outdated. “Why is it that when jumping from the collegiate world to the professional dance space we have to wear bathing suits and be subjected to ‘pageant-style’ auditions?” Lisa asks. “Who’s deciding that women can’t be normal-sized and dance? This product was created for a man, and it stayed present because men are in positions of power.” Still, several women found the body restrictions to be par for the course in the dance world. “For me, it’s the nature of the game,” says Kierra Douglas, a dancer for the Atlanta Hawks from 2011 to 2012. “You know, you’re in a two-piece in front of thousands of fans and you are the face — in a sense — of the organization. You represent them and the brand; of course you want to look your best.” Of the 14 teams that Yahoo Lifestyle reached out to, 13 declined the opportunity to comment on the strict body limitations discussed by dancers. A spokesperson for the Dallas Mavericks (where an internal investigation in September exposed sexual harassment “spanning almost 20 years”) took the opportunity, telling Yahoo Lifestyle that “several years ago,” the team eliminated “outdated image industry practices” regarding weight. “A previous version of our contract contained a single clause that mentioned a weight policy. This policy provided that dancers were to remain within five pounds of their determined performance weight,” the statement reads. “Image concepts like this were prevalent and previously accepted in the industry; however, not anymore at the Mavs.” The statement goes on to explain that the team is looking to “set an example” by revamping its standards. “[That] policy is inconsistent with our core values, and we removed it from our agreements,” the statement reads. “If there was an industry ‘look’ in the past, we’ve changed [it] for the better. The look is now about diversity, the art of dancing, and the dancers’ skill and performance.” ‘The pay was gas money — if that’ If the body-shaming tactics allegedly employed by many NBA dance teams are troubling, the dancers’ stories suggest that the compensation is worse. Three women remembered getting paid $50 a game; one said she took home $65. Three others said they made just $25 a practice, and one said that she and her teammates weren’t paid for practice at all. To put all that in perspective, the average price of a single NBA ticket during the 2012-2013 season (the earliest year this salary was mentioned) was $50; the average price of a ticket during the 2018-2019 season is $78. The average NBA stadium seats 18,966. On top of low pay, more than half of the women described either seeing or reading the following phrase in their contract: “It’s a part-time job with a full-time commitment.” While that concept might be normalized, what it describes, in certain cases, technically could have been illegal. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, employees are required to be paid at least minimum wage for “all hours worked,” which for professional dancers means even warm-ups, practices and performances at charity events. None of the 14 teams that Yahoo Lifestyle reached shared salary information, but multiple spokespeople affirmed that they — in the words of Bucks spokesman Barry Baum — “treat our employees respectfully and in compliance with the law.” “When they say a full-time commitment with part-time pay, they mean it,” says Ana Ogbueze from the Hornets, who danced while balancing college courses. Stephanie Hettchen, a dancer with the Miami Heat from 2010 to 2014, didn’t consider this a problem. “It was pretty much in our contract that it was a part-time job with a full-time commitment. You knew going in this was your dream, and just because I’m getting this exposure … doesn’t [mean it comes] with the money,” she says. “It’s more of an opportunity to open doors — especially in Miami.” Ana Ogbueze danced for the Charlotte Hornets from 2004 to 2008. (Image: Courtesy Ana Ogbueze; graphics: Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle) Only one of the 15 women interviewed, Kierra Douglas (then engaged, and now married, to NFL player Harry Douglas), said the salary was sufficient to live on. Three openly laughed at the idea that they could survive on NBA pay alone, and two described it as “gas money.” Five said they justified the pay by considering the job — one that they’d spent decades (in many cases) training for and beat out hundreds to secure — a “hobby.” All but one held at least two jobs; most mentioned three. There’s perhaps no one better suited to talk about the pay than Lauren Herington, the only dancer known to use a lawsuit to get more money from the NBA. But even that, a $250,000 settlement split among roughly 40 dancers, likely did little to offset the money they put into their work on the team. According to the Milwaukee Bucks’ rule book, which Lauren shared with Yahoo Lifestyle, dancers “must conform to all image standards set by the coach.” This might mean, Lauren says, that a woman with short hair would be required to get extensions — and, according to the rule book, visit the “exclusive hair salon of MBD.” According to the Mane Society, a hairstylists’ hub, hair extensions can cost anywhere from $200 to $3,000. “There was this girl I rode with to practice who had to [pay for] extensions, which were like $600, and there were times she was like, ‘I literally don’t have money to go to the grocery store,’” Lauren says. “They were required, and there was a couple times where she would have one or two left on her head, which was horrible, and we didn’t even mean to laugh, but she couldn’t afford to get new ones. … After the hours spent tanning, hair, and nails … [our wages] broke down to be about $3-$4 per hour.” While the Bucks may be the only team to have been publicly taken to task over salary so far, it’s not the only team mentioned by dancers as effectively paying at or below minimum wage. “Was it enough to make ends meet? Not even close,” says Madison Murray of her time on the Phoenix Suns. “That was one of the hardest parts. If girls were doing OK, it was because their parents were funding them. I was self-funding, so I had three jobs. I was getting up at 4 a.m. and working until 11:30 p.m.” Chenise Johnson, who danced for the Orlando Magic last year, says that rookies start at $10 an hour, then get a $1 raise each year. (The Magic, as a reference point, made $211 million in revenue in 2018.) “If you go into expecting the glitz and the glamour and think, ‘I’m about to get paid,’ you are going to get disappointed,” says Chenise. “The girls that stick around only do it because they love it. The pay obviously isn’t much.” Some of the more recent dancers, like Chenise, seem particularly willing to accept their low pay, despite the millions being grossed by the NBA while they represent these teams. A current dancer for the Detroit Pistons, speaking on condition of anonymity, seemed pleased by the salary — despite mentioning that she had to find another, full-time job upon making the team. “We actually get paid pretty good, in my opinion — $15 an hour,” says the dancer. “I think it’s [enough], because we’re not just doing it for the money. We’re doing it for the experience, for the exposure, to possibly branch off and do different things.” (The Pistons, currently valued at over $1.1 billion, brought in $221 million in revenue last year.) Lauren Herington danced for the Milwaukee Bucks from 2013 to 2014. (Photo: Courtesy Lauren Herington; graphics: Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle) On top of what dancers said were troublingly low salaries, three described a rule book that mandated they perform for free at charity events throughout the year. One of them was Kathryn Dunn, from the Dallas Mavericks. In response, the Mavericks sent a statement to Yahoo Lifestyle refuting the idea that performing for free was mandatory but conceding that dancers were sometimes unpaid. “Dancers are now paid for all of the time that they work,” the statement read. “Previously, dancers may not have received compensation for voluntary game appearances or rehearsals, but today we pay our dancers for all mandatory rehearsals, preparation time and getting dressed for each assigned appearance, game appearances, non-game appearances (including charitable events), approved interviews and certain travel outside of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Also, the dancers are offered free food before the game.” None of the 14 teams we reached out to refuted the dancers’ salary claims; many offered some version of a statement that described the payment structure as legal. (Read the full statements from the teams here.) NBA corporate declined to comment on wages specifically but sent the following statement on behalf of NBA spokesman Mike Bass: “Team dancers are valued members of the NBA family. We work with our teams to ensure that they comply with applicable wage and working condition laws for all employees, and they’re provided safe, respectful and welcoming workplaces.” ‘You’re brainwashed to think you’ve reached the pinnacle of success’ So why did women choose to stay and not fight to change the working conditions? The truth is, it’s more complicated than it seems, and it has roots in something called “occupational segregation,” according to Yasemin Besen-Cassino, author of The Cost of Being a Girl: Working Teens and the Origins of the Gender Wage Gap — startlingly evident when comparing the incomes of male NBA players, “a masculine coded occupation,” and female NBA dancers, “a feminine occupation,” she explains. “When an occupation is a feminine coded job, it pays less, and this type of gendered occupation is one of the most important contributors of the pay gap,” Besen-Cassino tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “In terms of why women accept low-pay jobs, it’s important to acknowledge that, for a long time, we shifted the burden of this persistent problem to the victims themselves.” Further, she says, “Previous research finds that when women negotiate, they might not succeed, and then experience a decline in their evaluations: They are less likely to be seen as team players, nice or caring for their craft. Such bias usually makes it less likely to ask for more.” Many of the dancers talked about dreaming of this job for decades and training for it from as early as age 5. Nearly all of them discussed out-dancing hundreds of women (or more) at auditions and knowing that the number of dancers vying for the job could be used against them. More than one woman mentioned feeling duped, saying that coaches persuaded the dancers to accept poor conditions under the pretense that they were lucky to be there. “It all starts from when you’re a little girl. You really want to be a dancer and be this successful woman, but when you finally get it, you find out that you are easily replaceable,” says Kathryn Dunn, the Dallas Mavericks dancer. “They ask you to do free appearances and pay you $15 for practices, but they back it up with, ‘If you don’t want to do it, we have hundreds of girls that would take your place.’ … These girls stick around because they think, ‘If I don’t dance, what am I going to do?’ You’re brainwashed to think you’ve reached the pinnacle of success.” Kathryn wasn’t the only one to equate the NBA’s tactics to manipulation. “It basically felt like they owned us,” says Sydney Sorenson, the Utah Jazz dancer, who claims that she was forced off the team because she spent too much time at other auditions. “I filed for unemployment because I was supposed to finish out the season and I needed the money to make it through school. I was totally OK with being done with the whole thing because I needed to repair a lot of things — I needed to repair my body, and I was in such a weird place. This was my identity, so I kind of crashed and burned, and I needed to rebuild — which sounds silly, but it had a huge effect on me.” Nearly every dancer — whether happy about her time on the team or not — raved about the friendships she had made. “I still keep up with a lot of the girls … I was in a few of their weddings,” says Alanna Sarabia, who danced for the San Antonio Spurs. “Those will be the best memories of my life,” says Stephanie Hettchen, who danced for the Miami Heat. “One girl was a bridesmaid at my wedding,” adds Kierra Douglas, a dancer for the Atlanta Hawks. “It’s like a sisterhood, a sorority. You build friendships that last forever.” Kierra Douglas danced for the Atlanta Hawks from 2011 to 2012. (Photo: Courtesy Kierra Douglas; graphics: Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle) Lisa Murray, who danced for the Golden State Warriors, finds statements like these irrelevant. “It’s wonderful people have found lasting relationships, but that shouldn’t negate the fact that women should be paid a living wage,” she says. “This is a perfect example of how women undermine their value in the workplace. If it really was a sisterhood, we wouldn’t be turning our back on women who have stood up and spoken out on being body-shamed, discriminated against, or paid unfairly. …  Women are brainwashed into thinking this [culture] is appropriate. It’s infuriating.” For Lauren Herington, who gave up dancing entirely, it’s not difficult to understand why women stay. “It’s kind of like a domestic abusive relationship — you’re kind of embarrassed about it,” she says. “You don’t really want to speak out about it, and you also sort of think it’s a normal situation.” Are there dancers who will disagree that things need to change? Sure. But those voices, in an age like this one, are likely to soon be drowned out by the louder ones — of people like Lisa Murray, who are fed up with the way things are and unwilling to quiet down until they change. “You are paid as a low-skilled worker but perform high-status work,” says Lisa. “When have ambassadors of an organization ever been paid as minimum-wage workers?” She hopes that the dancers will one day form a union, allowing them to fight for the rights they deserve.

sport Phillies Sign David Robertson, Adding to Off-Season Spending - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Phillies Sign David Robertson, Adding to Off-Season Spending Supported by Phillies Sign David Robertson, Adding to Off-Season Spending Image Reliever David Robertson pitched more than 500 games with the Yankees over nine seasons.CreditCreditBen Solomon for The New York Times By Tyler Kepner Jan. 3, 2019 David Robertson made his first major league appearance on June 29, 2008, the earliest Yankees debut of anyone on last year’s team. He went on to pitch in 500 more regular-season games for the Yankees. Only two pitchers — Mariano Rivera and Dave Righetti — have made more appearances for the team. Robertson, 33, will now pitch for the Philadelphia Phillies, who signed him to a two-year, $23 million contract on Thursday. It was the second time the Yankees let Robertson go as a free agent; he signed with the Chicago White Sox in December 2014 but returned in a trade after two and a half seasons. “I’ve had a wonderful time playing in New York; they’re an excellent organization, first class in everything, and I was fortunate to go to the playoffs with them six times,” said Robertson, who worked without an agent in these negotiations. “Being that this was my second time in free agency, there are other options out there, and there are other places to go. New York will always hold a place in my heart, but I think it was just time for me to go somewhere else.” Robertson has averaged 11.97 strikeouts per nine innings in his 11-year career, the most of any pitcher with at least 650 innings pitched. Last season, he had a 3.23 earned run average, with 91 strikeouts in 69 ⅔ innings. “He’s going to pitch high-leverage innings for us,” Phillies General Manager Matt Klentak said. “He’s been doing it very effectively and very consistently for a long time.” Robertson pitched in the last World Series game at Citizens Bank Park, for the Yankees in Game 5 in 2009, when the Phillies were a National League power. They have fallen since then and have tried to spend aggressively this winter, acquiring the All-Star shortstop Jean Segura in a trade with Seattle and signing outfielder Andrew McCutchen — a Yankee late last season — for three years and $50 million. Their biggest moves could still be to come. The Phillies will reportedly visit soon with the free-agent outfielder Bryce Harper, and they met last month with infielder Manny Machado, who also met with the Yankees. “Manny and his group were great,” Klentak said, adding later, “It was a productive day, and I expect that the dialogue there will continue.” The Yankees were not in serious talks with Robertson, who declined to elaborate on his role as union representative for the team’s divisive vote on postseason shares. The Yankees’ players awarded fewer full shares than any other team, rankling some within the organization. With Robertson gone, the Yankees still have several appealing bullpen options in free agency, including Zach Britton, who split last season between Baltimore and the Yankees, and Adam Ottavino, a Brooklyn native who starred for the Colorado Rockies last season.

sport Patriots will host Ravens-Chargers winner, unique history awaits Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Patriots will host Ravens-Chargers winner, unique history awaits Brendan C. HallNBC Sports BostonJanuary 6, 2019, 12:54 AM GMT Patriots will host Ravens-Chargers winner, unique history awaitsWill Lamar Jackson become the youngest QB to ever win a playoff game? Will the Chargers defy more expectations in January? Here's some things to know about the two teams vying to play in Foxborough next week. Patriots will host Ravens-Chargers winner, unique history awaits originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.com With the Indianapolis Colts jumping all over the Houston Texans to win the Wild Card round easily, locking themselves into a divisional round meeting at the Kansas City Chiefs next Saturday, we now know next week's opponent for the Patriots will be either the Baltimore Ravens or the Los Angeles Chargers, who square off Sunday at 1 p.m. There's not much history between Chargers coach Anthony Lynn and Bill Belichick, their lone meeting as head coaches coming in a Patriots win last season.  Scroll to continue with content Ad But they do share one major common denominator as direct descendents of the legendary Bill Parcells coaching tree. Belichick was Parcells' defensive coordinator in three different NFL stops, including his decade with the New York Giants that netted him his first two Super Bowl rings, while Lynn was Parcells' running backs coach his final two seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, on a staff that also included four other future head coaches in Mike Zimmer, Todd Bowles, Tony Sparano and Todd Haley. Lynn's reputation as one of the NFL's premier run-game coordinators has carried him well in Los Angeles, where he is one of several favorites for Coach of the Year. The Bolts have one of the most imposing backfield duos in Melvin Gordon and Austin Ekeler, and appear to finally be getting healthy at the right time. Where have we seen that formula before? . . . Story continues Under head coach John Harbaugh, the Ravens' playoff history against the Patriots has been thorny. The aftermath of their last postseason meeting, won by New England after Tom Brady's epic march back from down 14 points in the fourth quarter, was littered with controversy, after Harbaugh successfully lobbied the NFL to tweak its receiver eligibility rules after the Patriots deployed four-lineman formations that confused the Ravens' defense. That epic 2014 divisional round win helped vault the Patriots to their fourth Super Bowl title, and is often considered one of the most important wins of the Belichick era.  Before that, the Ravens delivered New England arguably two of its most devastating home playoff losses in franchise history. In the 2010 Wild Card game, Ray Rice ran in seemingly any direction he wanted as the Ravens jumped out to a 21-0 first quarter lead and skated to an easy 33-14 rout. The 2013 AFC Championship Game in Foxborough was another gut punch, a 28-13 Ravens win in which Baltimore rallied from a halftime deficit to score 21 unanswered second-half points, including two back-breaking fourth-quarter TDs from Anquan Boldin. Overall, the Ravens under Harbaugh are 3-6 against Belichick's Patriots. The Ravens are 6-1 since they made the switch to Lamar Jackson under center, thriving on the ground with some crafty read-option concepts that utilize the rookie's blazing speed.  Jackson will be the youngest QB to ever start a playoff game Sunday, at 21 years and 364 days. If he's victorious, he'd be just the sixth Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback since 1986 to win an NFL playoff game, joining Vinny Testaverde, Cam Newton, Carson Palmer, Marcus Mariota and Tim Tebow (yes, that Tim Tebow).

sport You Again? Yankees Open Exhibition Schedule Against the Champion Red Sox - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|You Again? Yankees Open Exhibition Schedule Against the Champion Red Sox Supported by You Again? Yankees Open Exhibition Schedule Against the Champion Red Sox Image The Red Sox rejoiced in the Bronx last October after winning their division series against the Yankees in four games. Weeks before, they celebrated on the same field after winning the American League East.CreditCreditBen Solomon for The New York Times By Billy Witz Dec. 7, 2018 If the Yankees are spending the winter trying to forget how their 2018 season ended — watching the rival Boston Red Sox celebrate not once, but twice, at Yankee Stadium — it will not get any easier when they start the 2019 exhibition season. The Yankees, who announced their exhibition schedule on Friday, will play their first game on Feb. 23 against — you guessed it — the Red Sox, who poured a lot of Champagne in the Bronx this fall. Boston won the American League East in a September game at Yankee Stadium and then repeated the insult with a division-series clincher in October. The Red Sox then went on to win the World Series in five games over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Red Sox, who will be the home team for the Grapefruit League opener, said that there would most likely be some sort of acknowledgment of last season’s championship that day but that nothing had been decided as of yet. It is not that the Yankees are gluttons for punishment; the exhibition schedule was worked out last August, before the Red Sox had won anything. And if the Red Sox do unfurl a championship banner on Feb. 23 or play Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” — which Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge played on his boom box as he left Fenway Park after his team’s only playoff victory against Boston in October — at least it will not be any worse than what the Yankees have already endured in recent months. The Yankees, who have finished behind the Red Sox in the A.L. East the last three seasons, will begin their latest chase when pitchers and catchers report to spring training in Tampa, Fla., on Feb. 13. Position players are due to report on Feb. 18, and the club’s first full workout is scheduled for the next day. The Yankees are scheduled to play 32 spring training games, including another against the Red Sox at Steinbrenner Field on March 15. The final exhibition game will be on March 25 in Washington against the Nationals. The Yankees will not see some familiar faces: the Mets, who are sticking close to their home in Port St. Lucie except for a handful of games, and the Miami Marlins and their co-owner Derek Jeter. But they cannot escape seeing the Red Sox. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Red Sox Will Haunt Yanks Yet Again.

sport Bulls players considered boycotting practice Sunday: Report Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Report: Bulls players debated boycotting practice in wake of 56-point loss Jason OwensYahoo SportsDecember 10, 2018, 12:00 AM GMT 2018 has been a disaster for the Chicago Bulls. They’ve compiled a 6-21 record, good for last place in the Eastern Conference. The miserable start led the front office to fire head coach Fred Hoiberg on Monday. On Saturday, they suffered the worst loss in franchise history, a 56-point drubbing at the hands of the Boston Celtics. Scroll to continue with content Ad Mutiny in Chicago? It’s all added up to too much for some players, who reportedly considered boycotting practice on Sunday. Some Bulls players reportedly pushed to boycott Jim Boylen’s Sunday practice three games into his tenure. (Getty) Reports: Some players talked team out of practice boycott The Chicago Tribune’s K.C. Johnson reports that players started a group text debating whether or not to show up for practice. They apparently decided against the drastic measure, opting instead for the time-tested players only meeting instead. After their own meeting, players met with coaches, according to the report. Johnson clarified that “two or three players” pushed for the boycott while veteran players were “adamant” that they show up. Report: Lopez, Markkanen were cooler heads The Athletic reports that Robin Lopez and Lauri Markkanen led the charge against the all-out boycott, convincing their teammates that a more professional approach of showing up to work and having meetings was a more appropriate tact.  The practice was scheduled after head coach Jim Boylen told reporters he specifically rested starters in the blowout loss so they had to energy to practice on Sunday. “Why have them play in a game that’s going to be very difficult to win when the benefit to me is going to be practice tomorrow and get better,” Boylen said Saturday. “So that was all premeditated to me in my mind. So I play them more, we lose tonight and can’t practice tomorrow, we double lose.” Story continues Players were reportedly upset about being pulled and the prospect of a full-blown practice the next day. A source told Johnson that Boylen had someone reveal in the meeting involving coaches and players that he didn’t plan to run a full practice session Sunday, but intended to go over film and have players work on shots as a way of building trust for the former associate head coach who took over the team three games ago.

sport Charges of Domestic Violence Against Reuben Foster Are Dropped - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Charges of Domestic Violence Against Reuben Foster Are Dropped Supported by Charges of Domestic Violence Against Reuben Foster Are Dropped Image Domestic violence charges against the former San Francisco 49ers linebacker Reuben Foster were dropped on Thursday.CreditCreditJeff Chiu/Associated Press By Ken Belson Jan. 3, 2019 Washington Redskins linebacker Reuben Foster, who was at the center of criticism over domestic violence in the N.F.L., has escaped prosecution. The state attorney’s office in Hillsborough County, Fla., dropped misdemeanor domestic violence charges against Foster. He was arrested Nov. 24 after an episode involving his ex-girlfriend in the hotel where the San Francisco 49ers, his former team, were staying. The 49ers did not wait for the case to play out and released Foster, a second-year player who had had other brushes with the law during his short N.F.L. tenure. Three days after his arrest, the Redskins claimed Foster, 24, off waivers, reigniting a debate over whether N.F.L. teams were taking the issue of domestic violence seriously enough. Foster is on the commissioner’s exempt list, which means he cannot play in games but can be paid while the league decides whether to suspend him. Foster was supposed to appear at an arraignment in Tampa on Thursday, but the hearing was canceled after prosecutors dropped the case. TMZ first reported that the case had been dropped. Last spring, Foster was charged with domestic violence, also against his ex-girlfriend. Those charges were also later dropped. Foster also had a confrontation with a hospital worker at the N.F.L. scouting combine in 2017, when he grew impatient while waiting for a drug test. He was sent home. The N.F.L. suspended Foster for two games at the start of this season because of an arrest on misdemeanor marijuana possession charges last January. He also faced weapons charges from the previous domestic violence incident because a loaded Sig Sauer 516 rifle was found on a bathroom floor. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service and two years of probation and is prohibited from possessing guns. Foster’s legal troubles have shined an uncomfortable light on the N.F.L. and its stated objective of holding players accountable for their behavior off the field, particularly when it includes violence against women. The league has said it no longer relies solely on law enforcement agencies for guidance on whether players should be penalized, because laws governing domestic violence vary from state to state, and cases can take months to adjudicate. At the same time, the league cannot stop teams from signing players who are fighting charges. The 49ers said that Foster had violated the team’s zero-tolerance policy against domestic violence. The Redskins, though, were widely criticized for signing Foster before his case had been resolved. In a statement after signing Foster, the Redskins said they “fully understand the severity of the recent allegations made against Reuben.” The team added, “If true, you can be sure these allegations are nothing our organization would ever condone.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Abuse Case Is Dropped, Clearing Skins’ Foster.

They are an indication of misjudgment. Alabama and Clemson aren’t just expected to advance past the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, the experts believe the two will cruise there, both installed as double-digit favorites, respectively against Oklahoma and Notre Dame, after Sunday’s predictably disappointing pairings were announced. The College Football Playoff committee had a chance to avoid its biggest day being a dud, to be daring, to go against the grain, to trust its members’ eyes and not just slide in the team with fewer losses. Instead, it let itself be held hostage by won-loss records. Instead, it took the easy way out, the people-pleasing route, picking one-loss Oklahoma over two-loss Georgia, taking the lesser team, the one that didn’t play a top-10 opponent all season, the 111th-ranked defense that allowed 40 points to Kansas of all teams rather than the balanced group that has the better win, a 19-point victory over No. 10 Florida, and played the vastly superior schedule. The committee punted its decision instead of going for it on fourth-and-short. This was a conservative move when aggression was needed. It would’ve taken guts to side with Georgia less than 24 hours after it blew a two-touchdown lead in the SEC Championship game. It would’ve taken forward, outside-the-box thinking to choose a conference runner-up over a conference champion. There would’ve been risk. Still, undefeated Alabama beat everyone but Georgia by at least 22 points. Everyone but the Bulldogs was overwhelmed and stood no chance. Silly me for expecting anything innovative or daring from the NCAA, which still has this ridiculous notion its amateurism model is in the best interest of student-athletes. see also College Football Playoff revealed, with a No. 4 debate The College Football Playoff committee went chalk. There were no... Committee chairman Rob Mullens, in defending his decision, said Oklahoma’s defense had played better in recent weeks. The Sooners allowed 437 yards of offense to Texas on Saturday. The week before, they were gashed for 704 yards and 56 points by West Virginia. As impressive as Kyler Murray and Oklahoma’s quick-strike offense can be, Nick Saban and Alabama must be thrilled. “I sure as hell don’t want to play them again,” Saban said Saturday about a potential Georgia rematch. The committee granted him his wish and gave the Crimson Tide a layup. The decision avoids creating future problems. It satisfies the power conferences, because it justifies the conference championship games. Remember, had the Big 12 not added one this year, maybe Oklahoma isn’t the choice, since it enabled the Sooners to pick up a significant win over Texas. Even Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany, whose league was left out of the playoff for the second straight year, told The Athletic he wasn’t pushing for expansion. Choosing Georgia may have changed things. It may have led to more debate about adding teams — it would’ve been the second consecutive year the SEC sent two teams to the playoff and you can be sure the other leagues would’ve screamed until they lost their respective voices — which is what should happen anyway. Under the current model, only the Power Five schools and Notre Dame — which is basically part of the ACC despite its official standing as an independent — have a shot. Central Florida just completed its second straight perfect season and it finished eighth in the rankings. The little guy has no chance. see also Choice is simple: Georgia belongs in College Football playoff Forget the metrics and ignore the numbers, even if they... But extending to eight teams would mean meaningless conference championship games would have to end. The leagues make too much money off those. They don’t want to see that happen. They prefer this make-believe playoff when only a handful of teams have the chance to be included. Central Florida athletic director Danny White hit it on the head when he called it an “invitational.” The Sooners are considered a major long shot, 14-point underdogs against Alabama. Notre Dame is getting 11 points against Clemson. This is the first time in the five-year history of the playoff both semifinal games are double-digit spreads. That speaks to the matchups selected. If the two games play out as expected, we will have the playoff committee to thank. Like everyone else, it saw Georgia nearly stun Alabama and match the Crimson Tide athlete for athlete. It was obvious the Bulldogs were one of the best four teams in the country. But rather than a rematch of that classic, instead of Georgia-Clemson, we get two uneven games, because Oklahoma has one less loss. Because the committee took the safe route that wouldn’t upset nearly as many powers that be. There was a choice here. Remember that on Dec. 29 when you’re falling asleep during these mismatches.

Getty Images More On: new york jets Sam Darnold's return doesn't sound far off Jets did what bad teams do and beat themselves Jets report card: A disaster in every spot but one Jets melt down and watch big lead and a victory vanish NASHVILLE, Tenn. — To a man, up and down the rows of lockers, the Jets tried to make a case for their coach. One by one they stepped forward and asked that they be the ones held accountable. Player by player they tried to shield their coach from what’s surely coming in a couple of weeks. “The coaches get the blame,” defensive lineman Leonard Williams said after the Jets lost 26-22 to the Titans at Nissan Stadium to fall to 3-9 on the season. “They’re the ones who are higher up on the chart. But it’s the players who make the mistakes. We’re the ones who deserve the blame.” It was a noble gesture, if a futile one. The Jets lost Sunday for most of the same reasons they’ve lost 32 of their last 45 games: when it’s most important to be disciplined, to stay away from killer penalties, they double down and seem to produce them by the gross. And the arrow of responsibility points in only one direction, despite their protests. “It’s difficult to go through as a coach,” Todd Bowles conceded. “I’m sure it’s frustrating to go through as a player.” The players seem most frustrated by the fact they can’t seem to help themselves, and as a result they are doing anything but help Bowles, or help to save his job. see also Jets report card: A disaster in every spot but one Grades from the Jets’ 26-22 loss to the Titans on... The Jets had 11 penalties for 96 yards. On the day. But it was on the final drive that they really haunted: a holding call on Morris Claiborne when the Titans were pinned and had themselves committed a holding that would have sent them further backward; a hands-to-the-face call on Jordan Jenkins that nullified a sack and would have set the Titans back to third-and-long; and a 15-yard facemask penalty on Trumaine Johnson that, coupled with a 25-yard run by Marcus Mariota, set the Titans up beautifully for the game-winning score with 36 seconds left. That was it for your ballgame. And that will soon be it for Bowles, despite his players’ pleas. “This game is solely on the players,” Jenkins said. “The coaches put us in good position. We made mistakes by committing penalties and not executing. [Bowles] didn’t go out there and commit penalties. That’s what hurts me the most, is that I had a part in making another man sort of look bad. It falls on me and everyone who commits penalties.” It was more of the same from linebacker Darron Lee: “You can’t sit here and sat anything like, ‘They didn’t coach us right.’ None of that. It’s on us. Penalties. Same story, different day.” Added linebacker Avery Williamson: “It’s getting to the point now where it’s becoming annoying because we’re not doing what we’re supposed to do. We still have to keep policing everybody, myself included.

sport Chandler Parsons leaving Memphis Grizzlies indefinitely Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Chandler Parsons, Memphis Grizzlies reportedly agree to part ways Ryan YoungYahoo SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 10:34 PM GMT Chandler Parsons, who hasn’t played since October, will leave the Memphis Grizzlies indefinitely while they work out a deal. (Joe Murphy/Getty Images) It appears Chandler Parsons’ time in Memphis has come to an end. Parsons will leave the Memphis Grizzlies indefinitely while his agent and their front office work to find a trade for him, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Scroll to continue with content Ad Grizzlies owe Parsons $38M, including his $25.1M guaranteed salary for 2019-20. He's in third season of a four-year, $94M contract. Details surrounding separation soon on https://t.co/XcwLHcsHad. https://t.co/aiJWdmlB6C — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) January 6, 2019 Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace wanted Parsons to play multiple games with their G League team, the Memphis Hustle, before returning to the Grizzlies active roster, per Wojnarowski. While Parsons was willing to play for the Hustle, he wanted a clearer plan in place for his return to the Grizzlies before doing so. This disagreement was reportedly the final straw. “We met with Chandler and spoke with him and his representation numerous times during his rehab process, laying out a number of options to help integrate a healthy and effective Chandler back onto the floor,” Wallace said in a statement to ESPN’s Tim MacMahon. “In the last of these conversations, we presented Chandler clear options for him and his representatives to choose, which included a short three-home-game stint for the Memphis Hustle or rehab either in Memphis or in Los Angeles with the training team of his choice. “Chandler subsequently chose to continue his rehab in Los Angeles. We will continue to monitor Chandler’s progress.” Story continues Parsons is currently in the third year of his four-year, $94 million deal with the Grizzlies. He’s still owed more than $38 million from the team under that deal, and is guaranteed to make $25.1 million next season. The 30-year-old has played in just three games this season while dealing with swelling in his right knee, and just 73 games total for the Grizzlies since he signed with them in 2016. Parsons had season-ending knee injuries or surgeries in each of his last four seasons, twice in Memphis and twice with the Dallas Mavericks. He was, however, medically cleared to play on December 21, though the Grizzlies have not used him yet. “The most confusing part for me is I’m healthy,” Parsons told the Commercial Appeal last month. “I’m medically cleared by the people I work with every single day, that are experts at this kind of stuff, so it’s frustrating to watch a team struggle and I’m sitting there on the bench healthy, dying to play.” The Grizzlies have lost 10 of their last 12 games, and are currently 11th in the Western Conference with an 18-21 record.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports The Oakland Raiders and general manager Reggie McKenzie will part ways after the season ends, according to a CBS Sports report Sunday. Head coach Jon Gruden, in the first year of a 10-year, $100 million contract, and McKenzie apparently haven't viewed players the same way this season. Gruden brought in players he favored and traded away two-time Pro Bowl selection Amari Cooper as well as Khalil Mack, the 2016 Defensive Player of the Year and a two-time, first-team All-Pro. McKenzie used first-round picks on both players. Scroll to continue with content Ad In the offseason, there were rumors that Bruce Allen, who previously worked with Gruden in Tampa Bay as well as during his first stint in Oakland, would join him with the Raiders. Allen is the president of the Washington Redskins, but fans and media have been calling for owner Daniel Snyder to replace Allen when the season ends.

sport Jeurys Familia’s Return to the Mets Was All About ‘Family’ - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Jeurys Familia’s Return to the Mets Was All About ‘Family’ Supported by Jeurys Familia’s Return to the Mets Was All About ‘Family’ Image Jeurys Familia had 123 saves in his first stint with the Mets. Now he will serve as Edwin Diaz’s setup man.CreditCreditJulie Jacobson/Associated Press By James Wagner Dec. 17, 2018 Sometimes players interpret being traded away from a team as a sign of rejection, that their old front office does not want them anymore. Not Jeurys Familia. When the Mets’ 2018 season went sideways, Familia knew they would follow the standard practice of extracting any bit of a return from their pending free agents. Sure enough, in exchange for sending Familia to the Oakland Athletics in July, the Mets received salary relief, two prospects and international bonus money. On a conference call with reporters on Monday, Familia explained why he returned to the Mets on a three-year, $30 million contract. “It means a lot for me because that’s where I grew up — 12 years in the organization from the minor leagues and the big leagues,” Familia said. “It’s like a family for me.” Familia, 29, did not come back for free, though. While he will earn less annually than standout closers on free-agent deals, he will be paid around the going rate for a top setup man. The same day Familia struck his deal, Joe Kelly, who is a year older than Familia and has less of a track record out of the bullpen, agreed to a three-year, $25 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers to be that team’s setup man. Familia, though, wanted to return to the Mets so badly that when the off-season began he told his agent to explore any possibility of returning to Queens. He had been through many ups and downs with the Mets. He signed with them for $100,000 at 17 out of his native Dominican Republic, using his earnings to build his family a home after a humble upbringing. He rose to become the team’s closer in 2015, blew three saves in that year’s World Series, then rebounded to make the All-Star team in 2016 while setting a franchise record with 51 saves. He started a family (his wife’s family lives in New Jersey), was suspended 15 games in 2017 for domestic violence accusations, and recovered from blood-clot surgery in his throwing shoulder. In seven years as a Met, Familia amassed 123 saves and a 2.66 E.R.A. “There a lot of people in our organization that are comfortable with him,” Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen said of Familia last week. When the Mets traded Familia, he said it was tough because it was all so new, but he still called his time in Oakland, where he pitched mostly as a setup man, a good experience. Even then, however, he hoped to return to New York. Familia wanted to return to closing — and he probably could have gotten a job this winter doing that — but the Mets had already traded for Edwin Diaz, an All-Star closer, earlier this month. Diaz, who had a 1.96 E.R.A. and a major league-high 57 saves last season, is younger (24) than Familia, throws harder, strikes out more batters, and possesses better command. “He’s one of the best closers in the game, and helping him in the bullpen is going to be fun,” Familia said of his new teammate. The Mets will need Familia’s help; their bullpen was among the worst in baseball last season, even when he was still in their uniform. Instead of pitching the ninth inning, Familia said the Mets told him he would pitch the eighth in front of Diaz. But roles can change, and he would earn a $500,000 bonus if he were to finish 50 games. When Mets Manager Mickey Callaway took over last year, he preached flexible roles for relief pitchers as a way to secure the best matchup against an opponent, but he ended up using Familia primarily as a closer, anyway. Before the acquisition of Familia last week, Callaway said Diaz would also be best used as a closer because the team had confidence in versatile relievers like Seth Lugo and Robert Gsellman. Now Familia is in the fold, as well. “It doesn’t matter what inning I’m going to pitch,” Familia said. “I come back here to win and get a championship.” Follow James Wagner on Twitter: @ByJamesWagner.

sport New Format for Basketball’s World Cup Has Very Good Players Feeling Very Frustrated - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|New Format for Basketball’s World Cup Has Very Good Players Feeling Very Frustrated Supported by New Format for Basketball’s World Cup Has Very Good Players Feeling Very Frustrated Image Dallas Mavericks forward Luka Doncic hasn’t been able to play for his Slovenian national team, which won the 2017 EuroBasket championship, as it tries to qualify for next year’s World Cup.CreditCreditRon Jenkins/Associated Press By Marc Stein Dec. 7, 2018 Luka Doncic, a leading contender for N.B.A. Rookie of the Year, expressed dismay Friday that his Slovenian national team had not been granted automatic entry into next year’s FIBA World Cup as the reigning EuroBasket winners. The team had tried, and failed, to qualify without him. “I’m so disappointed,” Doncic said in an interview after Friday’s practice with the Dallas Mavericks. “We’re the European champions. We should be playing.” Doncic, 19, is averaging 18.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists for the surprising Mavericks, quickly affirming Dallas’s belief that one of Europe’s best young players had instant N.B.A. star potential. But without Doncic playing, Slovenia is 2-8 in World Cup qualifying with two games to go. Under the previous system, the country would automatically have made the World Cup, which will be played in several cities across China next summer. A controversial format change for the World Cup instituted by FIBA, basketball’s world governing body, has forced 80 countries to compete for the 31 open slots in the field alongside the tournament host, China, via regional qualifying. It is similar to how the soccer World Cup entrants are decided. Two-thirds of the qualifying games, however, clash with the N.B.A. schedule. Unlike their soccer counterparts around the world, who are released to their national teams for qualifying matches via what are known as “international breaks,” N.B.A. players and the majority of Euroleague players are not allowed to leave their teams during the season to represent their respective countries. In Slovenia’s case, that has meant no Doncic, no Goran Dragic of the Miami Heat and the need for a new coach. Phoenix Suns Coach Igor Kokoskov had to surrender his Slovenia post once he took the Suns’ job. The United States also did not receive an automatic berth for the 2019 World Cup as part of the new format — not even as the defending World Cup champion and reigning Olympic champion. But the Americans clinched a spot with a victory Sunday in Uruguay under Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who has posted an 8-2 record in qualifying, relying mostly on players from the N.B.A.’s developmental G League. Thanks to the efforts of Van Gundy and the 46 players he has used in qualifying thus far, USA Basketball will be able to send its usual squad of N.B.A. All-Stars to China under San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, who has replaced Duke University’s Mike Krzyzewski as the full-time national team coach. Led by Doncic, Dragic and Kokoskov, Slovenia made a Cinderella run to the title at the EuroBasket tournament in 2017 — something Doncic described as “more amazing than anything in my life.” “To be European champions and not be in the World Cup, it’s tough,” Doncic said Friday. “I don’t know why they changed it.” Asked how his countrymen were taking it, Doncic referred to the fan support Slovenia received during its EuroBasket run and said: “You saw the final in Istanbul. They live for us.” FIBA instituted the soccer-style regional qualifying structure largely with the hope that bringing meaningful home games to every country in the competition — as opposed to summer qualifying tournaments at a centralized location — would help increase interest in the sport. It did so, however, knowing that the best players for numerous countries would not be available to participate. For Slovenia and any other nation that fails to qualify for China, earning a spot in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo will be challenging. It will require an invitation to one of four last-chance qualifying tournaments shortly before the Olympics start in 2020. Only the four bracket winners in those tournaments will advance to Tokyo. Doncic acknowledged that leading Slovenia to its first-ever Olympic berth in basketball is one of his major career goals. “Olympics, next EuroBasket, next World Cup — I want to play for the national team whenever I’m available,” Doncic said. “If I don’t have injuries, I’ll play.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: New World Cup Format Irks Some Top Players.

sport Onside drop kick lands with a thud for Seahawks Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Onside drop kick lands with a thud for Seahawks Mike FlorioProFootball Talk on NBC SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 1:26 PM GMT Down 10 points with little more than two minutes left, the Seahawks were done. Unless they weren’t. After rocketing down the field, scoring a touchdown, going for two (due to the Sebastian Janikowski injury), and getting it, the Seahawks found themselves trailing by the score of 24-22 with 1:18 to play and an onside-kick away at stealing a victory. If they could score another touchdown, because field goals seemed to be off the table. Scroll to continue with content Ad A conventional onside kick was off the table, too. Punter Michael Dickson tried a drop kick instead. But when it came off his foot it looked like a shot from a pitching wedge that inadvertently sailed over the green. In this case, the rough on the other side of the smooth, flat stuff was the waiting embrace of Cowboys receiver Cole Beasley, who easily caught the ball on the fly and sealed the game. So what was Dickson trying to do? Apparently, exactly what he did. “He was trying to get it over the top so we could go get it,” coach Pete Carroll told reporters after the game. “Beasley was up there closer than we thought and he just popped it a bit too hard.” It’s hard to blame the Seahawks for getting creative. The safety-driven reconstruction of the kickoff formation has made it much more difficult to recover the normal rock-skip-on-a-pond onside attempt. Which should push the powers-that-be toward the fourth-and-15 alternative, where the team that otherwise would be kicking off can punt or go for it. However it would have played out last night, the effort surely would have been a lot more intriguing than what the Seahawks tried to do in order to keep alive their slim chance of pulling off what would have been an incredible comeback. Story continues It that’s what the league is trying to do as the extinction of the kickoff looms, it’s brilliant. Faced with a potential fan and media mutiny for revolutionizing a key aspect of the game, fans and media could actually start clamoring for something other than what the league currently does, if there’s no realistic way for a team that is trailing late to have a chance to keep the game interesting.

sport Firing of Several Black Coaches Puts N.F.L. Hiring Under Scrutiny - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Firing of Several Black Coaches Puts N.F.L. Hiring Under Scrutiny Supported by On Pro Football Firing of Several Black Coaches Puts N.F.L. Hiring Under Scrutiny Image Among five African-American coaches fired as the N.F.L. season wound down was Steve Wilks, who coached the Arizona Cardinals (3-13) for one season. CreditCreditDavid Eulitt/Getty Images By Bill Pennington and Ken Belson Dec. 31, 2018 The N.F.L.’s 32 owners made an unexpected announcement after meeting a few weeks ago: The league was strengthening rules that obligate teams to consider minority candidates when hiring coaches and executives in their front offices. At the time, the league said it was just trying to beef up existing regulations, not reacting to criticism that teams had been skirting the rules for years. “Our focus was simply: How do we make the Rooney Rule better?” Robert Gulliver, the league’s chief human resources officer, said, referring to the rule adopted in 2003 and named for Dan Rooney, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time who pushed for the regulations. Now, the league’s stated commitment to the rule will be put to the test. On Monday, the number of African-American coaches fired in 2018 soared to five, leaving only two black coaches in a league where at least 70 percent of the players are African-American. Race is already a much-discussed topic in relation to the league. Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who in 2016 began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality toward people of color, has not played in the league for the last two seasons. His protests amplified an already polarizing debate across the country, and he has filed a grievance accusing the N.F.L. of colluding to keep him off the field. Coaches losing their jobs at the conclusion of the regular season is routine and expected, as they fall victim to the merciless pressure from owners and fans to succeed year after year. In addition to the five black coaches fired, three white coaches were let go this season, in Green Bay, Tampa Bay and Miami. But with the N.F.L. under pressure to increase the percentage of minority coaches and executives, the makeup of the latest class of jettisoned coaches was especially startling. Four black coaches were fired Sunday or Monday, including the Jets’ Todd Bowles, who was let go shortly after his team’s final loss Sunday. The Jets had a 14-34 record in the last three seasons under Bowles. Marvin Lewis, who had been at the helm of the Cincinnati Bengals since 2003, was fired Monday. Though he had resurrected the moribund Bengals and took them to the playoffs multiple times, he never won a playoff game and this season was Cincinnati’s third consecutive one with a losing record. Also fired Monday was Denver Broncos Coach Vance Joseph, who had presided over the first back-to-back losing seasons for the Broncos since the early 1970s. In Arizona, Steve Wilks had been the Cardinals’ coach for just one season when he was fired Monday after his team compiled a league-worst record of 3-13. In October, another African-American coach, Hue Jackson, was fired after his teams were 3-36-1 in roughly two and a half seasons. The two black head coaches still in the N.F.L. are Anthony Lynn of the Los Angeles Chargers (12-4), who are headed to a wild-card playoff game Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens, and Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6-1). Carolina Panthers Coach Ron Rivera, who is Latino, is the only other minority head coach. With eight coaching vacancies, it is possible that some of the recently dismissed coaches will be leading candidates for those openings; their experience and certain attributes may be a better fit with other teams. Jackson, for example, was on Lewis’s coaching staff in Cincinnati. And there are other minority candidates, like the Kansas City offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy and Stanford Coach David Shaw, whose names have popped up in coaching discussions. But the next several weeks will unquestionably heighten the scrutiny on the N.F.L.’s hiring practices and how reliably, or willingly, the Rooney Rule will be employed. Gulliver would not admit something that many onlookers and people around the N.F.L. have long suspected: that teams have been doing only the bare minimum to comply with, or sidestepping, the Rooney Rule. After all, if the rule was working as intended, and the percentage of minority coaches and executives was growing steadily, why would the rule need to be strengthened? Under the new regulations enacted a few weeks ago, when teams are looking to fill positions, they must interview at least one minority candidate from a list kept by the league’s Career Development Advisory Panel, or a minority candidate not currently working with a team. Teams also must keep detailed records of who they interview, which is perhaps a response to criticism from minority candidates who say they are routinely called, but not formally interviewed, by teams trying to do the least possible to fulfill their obligations. After it was first established, the Rooney Rule appeared to be having an impact. By 2011, eight N.F.L. teams had coaches of color, the most to that point, or since. Yet, at the same time, hiring minority front office executives did not keep pace. And recently, one of the few black general managers in the league, Reggie MacKenzie, who was named the N.F.L. executive of the year in 2016, was forced out as the Oakland Raiders chief football executive. Ozzie Newsome, another African-American general manager, is expected to retire from his post with the Ravens at the end of this season. The N.F.L. has likewise been challenged in its efforts to expand opportunities for black assistant coaches, a job that is the natural springboard to a head coaching position. Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, noted in a 2017 report that the percentage of assistant coaches of color had declined slightly to 31.4 percent. The number of African-American offensive or defensive coordinators had dropped from 14 to 13, Lapchick said. Since assistant coaches typically get swept out the door along with a fired head coach, the number of vacant N.F.L. coaching jobs this week is likely several dozen, even if the eight unoccupied head coach positions garner all the attention. That is a lot of interviewing about to take place in the N.F.L. not long after 32 owners stood behind new, reinforced rules designed to increase the number minorities seriously considered for just such hires.

sport First in Trophies, First in Revenue, Sixth in the Table - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Soccer Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Soccer|First in Trophies, First in Revenue, Sixth in the Table Supported by On Soccer First in Trophies, First in Revenue, Sixth in the Table Image A Manchester United shop in New Delhi, a far-off outpost in the club’s massive commercial empire.CreditCreditPrakash Singh/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Rory Smith Dec. 14, 2018 MANCHESTER, England — The future arrived a few weeks before Christmas in 1994, materializing in a 5,000-foot warehouse behind the Stretford End at Old Trafford. Surrounded by jerseys and hats and trinkets, all emblazoned with Manchester United’s logo, it fell — naturally enough — to Alex Ferguson to open the doors on English soccer’s first megastore, and the sport’s new dawn. As ever, back then, Manchester United was at the sharp end of progress. Martin Edwards, the club’s chairman at the time, had followed Tottenham Hotspur’s lead in going public, in order to raise funds to revamp the club’s stadium. That money, in turn, allowed Edwards to move ahead with expanding Old Trafford, adding not only thousands more ordinary fans, but dozens more executive boxes. There had been an overhaul of the club’s merchandising operation, too. Edwards had bought the lease to United’s store back from the family of Matt Busby; Edwards’s director of merchandising, Edward Freedman, had proceeded to revamp the team’s licensing business, and modernize the mail-order department. Until the early 1990s, it had a staff of two, taking orders and packing them. When they wanted to pack, they took the phone off the hook. The new megastore became the jewel in the crown, a vast retail emporium that would allow United to rake in still more money, and plow those funds back into Ferguson’s team. It was the centerpiece of a plan to turn Manchester United into a financial — and, consequently, footballing — juggernaut. Image Manchester United is sixth in the Premier League table heading into Sunday’s game at first-place Liverpool.CreditOli Scarff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Liverpool, for so long United’s superior, England’s most successful club for the last two decades, needed to find a way to keep pace. Eventually, by the summer of 1995, the power brokers at Anfield had their answer. They would install a small McDonald’s franchise — complete with the golden arches — in the heart of the Kop. Unsurprisingly, the move did not prove popular. By 2003, McDonald’s confirmed that the branch was to close down, because of insufficient profits. Three years earlier, the megastore at Old Trafford had been forced to move, too. It had relocated to the stadium’s west stand, because it needed more space. It is not to downplay the genius of Ferguson, or the brilliance of the players he had at his disposal, to suggest that the story of Manchester United’s success in the Premier League era is, at least in part, a commercial one. More than any club, United embraced the unfettered, unrestrained capitalism that swept through English soccer in the 1990s, and won all of the benefits that come from being an early adopter. Edwards recognized the need to go public, to maximize Old Trafford’s match-day revenue, to build an international brand. Image Manchester United’s executive chairman, Ed Woodward, has not always seen eye to eye with the team’s manager, José Mourinho.CreditJon Super/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images And United’s current owners, the Glazer family, pioneered a radical approach to sponsorship that has since been copied by almost all of United’s rivals: signing dozens of minor, territory-specific agreements with everything from tractor producers to vineyards. United was mocked, in the 1990s, for its willingness to hawk anything with its crest; it is mocked, now, for having an official soft-drink partner in Nigeria. The results, either on the books or on the field, have been no laughing matter. Liverpool, by contrast, seemed to be clinging to the past. In 1992, it had completed work on a new stand at Anfield, which opened on the 100th anniversary of the club’s first game. This was not a club, though, embracing the future. The Centenary Stand (since renamed for Kenny Dalglish) might have been home to Anfield’s first executive boxes — long after most of its rivals had started offering corporate hospitality — but it was, almost as soon as it opened, out of date: too small, too functional, too old-fashioned. United was preparing itself for a changing world. Liverpool was assuming everything would always be as it was. When United threw open the doors to its megastore, Liverpool’s club shop was still a small hut in a parking lot. There were reasons for that stasis. Anfield, unlike Old Trafford, was hemmed in by tight, narrow residential streets; it had already had to shelve plans for expansion because of objections from neighbors. Liverpool, as a club, was still reeling from both the Heysel disaster of 1985, in which 39 Juventus fans were killed, and the Hillsborough tragedy four years later, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Image Manchester United won 13 Premier League titles under Alex Ferguson but has yet to add to that total since he retired in 2013.CreditJason Cairnduff/Reuters But whatever the circumstances, the impression — of one club rendered complacent by success and another, driven on by its absence — was a fair one. United raced past Liverpool partly because of its own dynamism, and partly because Liverpool stalled. More than two decades on, it is tempting to wonder if the coin has flipped, and if United, England’s most successful club, has fallen into the same trap as its old rival once did. There is a mounting suspicion that the travails of United since Ferguson retired in 2013 carry with them an echo of what Liverpool went through in the 1990s. The parallel is not perfect. United’s failure is not a financial one — it remains massively profitable; nobody could accuse it of not eking every last cent from its brand — but a structural one. The most obvious symptom is the absence, now almost unique in elite soccer, of a technical director, someone to look after the health of the sporting side of the club in the long term: to run recruitment and to oversee the youth system; to manage contracts and managerial appointments; to institute a distinct philosophy; and to provide a bridge with the boardroom. Ferguson, in his later years, played that role: he had stepped back from the day-to-day grind of coaching long before he retired. Since he left, though, United has been run by an uneasy coalition of its manager and its executive chairman, Ed Woodward. It has rarely been clear who, precisely, has the final word on signings. There is no apparent strategy, either, beyond Woodward’s apparent conviction that United should try to acquire superstars. That applies to managers, too: appointing first David Moyes, on Ferguson’s recommendation; then an aging Louis Van Gaal; before plumping for Jose Mourinho despite internal reservations over his combustibility. Contract negotiations — designing the squad for this year, and next, and the year after that — are similarly chaotic: the club has been forced to trigger compulsory one-year extensions for a handful of players; it has waited and waited to renegotiate with others, often eventually paying more than it expected out of the belief that players will be reluctant to leave Old Trafford. But just as damning are the myriad small things: the scouting offices left unoccupied at the club’s training facility, because the department has not been staffed adequately since before Ferguson’s departure; the fact that a number of players have sought medical treatment with outside specialists, and complained to Woodward that the care on offer at the club is not what they receive with their national teams or were afforded at their former employers; the decline of the reputation of United’s academy, now regularly rejected by prospective recruits in favor of Manchester City’s. Just as Liverpool once did, United has failed to recognize that the world has changed, that the game has moved on, that what was enough yesterday will not be enough to thrive tomorrow. Just as Liverpool once did, United spent so long leading the way that it stopped to rest, and was passed by its pursuers in the night. That does not mean United, like Liverpool, will have to wait 28 years, and counting, for a Premier League title. Its commercial potency is such, and the power structures of the game so much more rigid, that it can expect to return to primacy much quicker than it took Liverpool to do so. But United’s visit to Anfield on Sunday — where the mood is more hopeful, now, than it has been for almost three decades — should give Mourinho’s employers, more than the manager himself, pause for thought. Liverpool, at last, feels like a club as excited by what is to come as it is proud of what once was. The future arrived some time ago, and the cash registers were ringing too loudly in the megastore for Manchester United to hear. Follow Rory Smith on Twitter: @RorySmith.

sport For Mo’ne Davis, a Social Awakening and a Commitment to Hampton - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|For Mo’ne Davis, a Social Awakening and a Commitment to Hampton Supported by For Mo’ne Davis, a Social Awakening and a Commitment to Hampton Image Mo’ne Davis, a 5-foot-5 guard, excels in multiple sports, but has committed to play softball at Hampton University in Virginia next year.CreditCreditMark Makela for The New York Times By Jeré Longman Dec. 19, 2018 PHILADELPHIA — The point guard with familiar braids stole the ball once, twice, three times in succession. She scooped in a shot, then twirled a layup over her head while facing away from the basket. “Sweet!” a friend yelled at a recent high school game. This is the future Mo’ne Davis imagined for herself four summers ago, when she became the first girl to pitch a shutout at the Little League World Series and, apparently, was the first African-American girl to participate in the tournament. She spoke then of wanting to play college basketball at powerhouse Connecticut and professionally in the W.N.B.A. But circumstances change, teenage interests diverge, horizons broaden. Now 17 and a senior at Springside Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia, Davis continues to excel in multiple sports. But an ankle injury last summer required an extended recovery and, she said, dampened the interest of basketball recruiters from midmajor colleges. Instead, Davis has committed to playing softball — she is a shortstop — at Hampton University in Virginia, with an opportunity to explore basketball there if her first love blooms anew. Her decision to attend a historically black university was partly inspired by the positive experiences of older friends. It also reflected a social awakening informed, among other things, by meeting President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama at the White House in 2014; an incident in 2015 that victimized her on social media; and a bus trip through the South that year with her rec-center baseball team to visit landmarks of the civil rights era. After attending the predominantly white Springside Chestnut Hill Academy since second grade, Davis said, “I just thought it was a perfect fit to be able to play with other girls who look like me or perhaps grew up kind of the same way I grew up.” That eye-opening 2015 trip through the South began with wonder and horror. On June 17, 2015, as Davis and her teammates departed by bus from Philadelphia to Washington, the white supremacist Dylann Roof shot to death nine parishioners, all African-Americans, in a massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. Image In the summer of 2014, Davis became the first girl to pitch a shutout at the Little League World Series.CreditBrett Carlsen for The New York Times Until then, Davis said, she had paid little or no attention to the news beyond sports. But the next morning, as she and her teammates ate breakfast in their hotel in Washington, she said they watched television, stunned and afraid. News reports suggested the gunman, whose arrest had not yet been announced, might be headed northward as they headed southward. “It showed that there was still hate in the country,” Davis said. “It changed the way I started to see things.” Later that day came another significant moment for Davis, this one affirming and uplifting. She and her teammates met Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a towering activist in the civil rights movement who helped lead the marches from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965 to promote black voter registration and the Freedom Rides that challenged segregation of public buses. For months before the trip, the teenage athletes studied the country’s black history, from slavery through the civil rights era. They had seen the movie “Selma” and videos of Lewis and other demonstrators being clubbed by Alabama state troopers at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965, in what became known as Bloody Sunday. When Davis met him in person, she said Lewis’s stature left her breathless. “You see him in these movies and videos, and he doesn’t seem like a human being after everything he’s gone through,” Davis said. Lewis told the players a well-known story about forgiveness and reconciliation. In 2009, he received a visit on Capitol Hill from a former supporter of the Ku Klux Klan. Decades earlier, the man and others had attacked and bloodied Lewis when he tried to enter a waiting room for whites at a bus station in Rock Hill, S.C. “Mr. Lewis, I’m one of the people that beat you,” Elwin Wilson, the former Klan supporter, then in his 70s, and who died in 2013, told the congressman. “I want to apologize. Will you forgive me?” Wilson began crying. “I forgive you,” Lewis said. The men hugged. Recounting the story, Davis said: “I thought that was one of the coolest things ever. This world is already full of hate. You can’t just keep putting hate out there.” Lewis’s compassion validated for Davis a gesture of tolerance she had made three months earlier, in March 2015. A baseball player named Joey Casselberry at Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania wrote dismissively on Twitter about Davis’s accomplishments in the 2014 Little League World Series and called her a “slut.” His odious remarks resulted in his suspension for the 2015 season, but Davis asked that Casselberry be reinstated, saying at the time, “Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance.” Casselberry was permitted back on the Bloomsburg team in 2016. A university spokesman said Davis’s request did not play a role in that decision. But she remains assured that absolution was the correct response. “We decided to take the high road and be the bigger person,” she said. Now, as in Little League, Davis seems to possess a preternatural calm and poise on the court and the playing field. Her basketball coach, Florence Hagains, described her as a player who phones at night to discuss ways to improve, eagerly credits her teammates and encourages the uncertain eighth-grader on Springside Chestnut Hill’s varsity roster. Emily McNesby, a former high school soccer teammate of Davis’s who now plays at Maryland, said, “She’s not one of these people who’s like, ‘I’m already famous so I don’t have to work hard.’ She always picked up everyone’s mood. She brought a happy spirit to the team.” In an age of specialization, Davis has followed her own path, playing as many sports as she can squeeze into her calendar. She has won state championships in soccer and softball among Pennsylvania’s independent high schools. And she continues to pitch in the summers, throwing from a major league distance of 60 feet 6 inches. In 2017, her Philadelphia team, which included seven members of the Little League World Series squad, won a national competition called the Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities World Series. Davis pitched nine and a third innings in the tournament, allowing only two earned runs. She threw a gem in the semifinals, retiring eight of the first 12 batters she faced, spotting her fastball at a speed in the mid-70s and sprinkling her curve and changeup to keep hitters off balance. “I go more for command of my pitches now than overpowering people,” the 5-foot-5 Davis said. “I know that’s not going to work.” She has lived her sports career in reverse, appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated and pitching before a television audience of millions before eighth grade, then adjusting to becoming a high school athlete in much less visible circumstances. Image Davis with Michelle Obama during the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony in Washington in 2014.CreditCarolyn Kaster/Associated Press During the Little League World Series, Davis pulled a hoodie tight over her head one night to be able to walk anonymously around the ballpark in Williamsport, Pa. Otherwise, she needed security and a golf cart to get around, such was the crush of interest. Four months later, her pioneering effort was celebrated by the Obamas, who invited her to the White House. She said she was inspired by their counsel: “You changed the sports world. Keep going. Don’t let anyone stop you.” At times, though, Davis said, the attention became overwhelming. (“I was a kid; I wasn’t prepared for this.”) Now, she gets requests for the occasional autograph and photograph but no longer plays in a spotlight that was both illuminating and claustrophobic. She is expansive and funny during interviews and plans to major in communications at Hampton, hoping to become a motivational speaker for children and to host her own television sports show. Around friends, she is known simply as Mo, and she demurs when they teasingly call her “Big Time” and “Superstar.” “She’s a novelty in the white community, a celebrity you want to take a picture with, but in the black community, she’s more of a cultural icon,” said Steve Bandura, 57, Davis’s longtime rec-center coach and mentor, who is white. “Little League baseball is a white suburban sport. Mo’ne is an African-American girl. She crossed every barrier.” It was Bandura’s idea for the 2015 tour of civil rights landmarks. Years ago, he gave up a sales and marketing career to work with disadvantaged youth. In 1995, at the Marian Anderson Recreation Center, in South Philadelphia, he formed a youth sports development organization called the Anderson Monarchs — named after the celebrated African-American singer and the famed Negro League baseball team, the Kansas City Monarchs. To understand the present, Bandura told Davis and her teammates, they must understand the past. So the Monarchs departed in June 2015 on a 23-day tour of playing games and gaining a firsthand appreciation of the courage and struggle of black history in America. They traveled in a 1947 Flxible Clipper bus, signifying the year that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball. Image Around friends, Davis is known simply as Mo.CreditMark Makela for The New York Times On June 24, Davis’s 14th birthday, the Monarchs visited the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. In 1963, four black girls — three of them age 14 — were killed at the church in a bombing by white supremacists. “We walked past where the bomb was placed; I still don’t have words for it,” Davis said. “What could those girls have done in their lives? They could have changed the world.” In Selma, after the Monarchs walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and saw murals and artifacts that included a hooded Klan outfit, Davis and her stepfather consoled a white teammate, Carter Davis, who said he grew emotional and began expressing guilt about the historical outrages committed against blacks. “He was 13 at the time; he was torn apart,” Mo’ne Davis said. She and her stepfather, Mark Williams, invited Carter Davis to stay with them that night and played the card game Uno to lighten the mood. “They were like, ‘You’re one of us, you’re not at fault, you shouldn’t feel bad,’” Carter Davis said. The most unnerving moment of the trip for her, Mo’ne Davis said, came at the Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. An exhibit there provided a stark simulation of a lunch counter sit-in, with visitors feeling jostled and hearing threats and the sounds of objects being thrown and broken. “I couldn’t sit through the whole thing,” Davis said. “I got up and thought I was going to cry. It scared me so bad.” The trip, she said, made her realize that “being African-American, not everything is going to be the same as it is for my friend who is white.” But it also left her thankful “for all the people who fought for the freedom we now have.” Next fall, Davis will head off to college to study and play softball. She looks forward to playing in the infield and getting a chance to bat. But she does not plan to pitch. The whipping motion of pitching a softball underhand is nothing like throwing a baseball overhand. She laughed. “I know the mechanics,” she said, “but for some reason the ball just doesn’t reach home plate.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Onetime Superstar in Little League Embraces Social Awareness, and Softball.

sport A Soaring N.F.L. Is Disrupted by a Familiar Demon: Off-Field Abuse - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|A Soaring N.F.L. Is Disrupted by a Familiar Demon: Off-Field Abuse Supported by On Pro Football A Soaring N.F.L. Is Disrupted by a Familiar Demon: Off-Field Abuse Image Running back Kareem Hunt was released by the Chiefs on Friday.CreditCreditPeter Aiken/Getty Images By Ken Belson Dec. 2, 2018 Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt seemed to embody an N.F.L. that had been regaining its footing after a period of sliding ratings and fan anger over player protests during the national anthem. The league has enjoyed higher-scoring games, better television ratings and the emergence of several exciting young players like Hunt, who has been a force behind the Chiefs’ ascension the last two years. Now, Hunt has come to embody something else about the league: Its recurring problem with players’ abusive conduct off the field and a penchant for giving second chances to those who play well despite a professed intolerance for off-field transgressions. And so the N.F.L., the nation’s richest and most popular sports league, again finds itself under scrutiny for something other than touchdowns and tackles, having to answer for the reality that some teams will sign troubled but talented players as long as they can tolerate the bad publicity. On Friday, a graphic video emerged of Hunt shoving a woman, before and after she struck him in the face, and kicking her when she was on the ground during an altercation in a Cleveland hotel in February. The Chiefs quickly announced they would release him, and Hunt was later suspended indefinitely from playing by the league. Both the league and the Chiefs said they had investigated the episode immediately after it occurred. But no criminal charges were filed, and no disciplinary action was taken at the time. The N.F.L. and the Chiefs said they had not seen the hotel video, which TMZ obtained and posted. The N.F.L. did not interview Hunt because none of the alleged victims would speak to the league. Instead, the league relied on the Chiefs, who were told by Hunt that no violence had occurred, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to discuss its specifics. Hunt was involved in another violent episode in May, when he punched a man in the face, but again, the police did not file charges, and the Chiefs took no action against him. Also last week, Reuben Foster, a linebacker, was released by the San Francisco 49ers after being arrested on domestic violence charges, but was then almost immediately hired by the Washington Redskins. Foster is suspended from play and practices but can work out and attend team meetings. Doug Williams, the former player and current Redskins executive, was roundly criticized when he described Foster’s arrest as “small potatoes” in a radio interview. He later apologized. Experts who have advised the league said teams were foremost focused on winning, and the league and teams preferred to handle situations that might require discipline internally, keeping matters under wraps as long as possible. If the bad behavior is exposed, teams adopt a crisis response approach to clean it up. “They hold everything close to the chest,” said Rene Redwood, who has advised the league on issues of race and abuse. “When it becomes a consistent problem, and holding the information doesn’t seem to remedy it, they try to get through it with another public relations activity.” The league in recent years has sought to project intolerance for off-field misconduct. In 2014, after several star players — including Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy — were suspended after they had been charged with physical abuse or domestic violence, the N.F.L. beefed up its investigation unit and said it would no longer rely solely on the police or whether charges had been filed when assessing possible misconduct. Yet self-reflection and scrutiny have never been this league’s strong suit — it’s a multibillion-dollar business trying to survive and thrive amid questions about head injuries and the changing dynamics of television — and some players are penalized only a few games, if at all, for their misconduct. They often get signed by teams that cross their fingers and hope the players behave. “It sends a troubling message because there’s a lack of consistency,” said Mark Conrad, who teaches sports law and ethics at Fordham University. These episodes are “a validation of the continued problem the league has with this issue, that individual teams will prioritize their need for certain players despite questionable behavior off the field.” Indeed, Clark Hunt, the Chiefs’ co-owner and chief executive, said this summer that he was hopeful that Kareem Hunt had learned from his past. “I’m sure he learned some lessons this off-season and hopefully won’t be in those kinds of situations in the future,” he said. Image Reuben Foster was hired by the Washington Redskins after the San Francisco 49ers released him because of a domestic violence arrest.CreditJeff Chiu/Associated Press On Sunday, Kareem Hunt apologized but also asked for another chance to play in the N.F.L. “I was in the wrong,” Hunt told ESPN. “I’m asking for forgiveness and I definitely believe I deserve forgiveness.” Coach Andy Reid said little about the situation after Kansas City’s 40-33 win over the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, which bumped their record to 10-2. “As we’ve done in the past, we handle it within and we handle it with the person affected,” Reid said. Players have due process rights under the collective bargaining agreement and can be falsely accused, of course. Yet the league also has been burned by relying on incomplete police investigations, so it has come to do its own digging to determine if penalties are warranted, even if no criminal charges are filed. Still the N.F.L., lacking the authority of law enforcement, has had trouble gathering evidence and getting the cooperation of those making accusations. The police in Cleveland were also limited in what they could do. A spokeswoman for the Cleveland Police, Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia, said that detectives do not pursue cases like Hunt’s, which was classified as misdemeanor assault. To file charges, the accuser would have had to go to the city prosecutor’s office, which she did not do. Sergeant Ciaccia did not say whether the N.F.L. had asked her department for the video of the altercation. But she said the department never had the video, and that “to my knowledge” the police never saw it. “The video may have been released by the hotel,” she added. Even so, the cases of Foster and Hunt are as much about how their teams gave them the benefit of the doubt more than once. Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers coach, told reporters that the team didn’t need to wait for the legal process to conclude before deciding to cut Foster. But Foster has been part of several other troubling episodes. He was sent home from the scouting combine two years ago because of an altercation with a hospital worker. He was accused of domestic violence during the off-season, but his former girlfriend — the same woman from the most recent accusations — recanted the accusation. Hunt was suspended for the first two games of this season because of a misdemeanor gun charge and a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge that was dropped. In October, Foster had another run-in with his former girlfriend, but no arrests were made. It was only after Foster was arrested at the team hotel on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge hours before a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that the 49ers cut him. “Too many things have happened, and we’ve tried to help him out a lot,” Shanahan said. “And I know he has been trying, too. But this was a mess-up that it doesn’t matter whether he did or not.” The Redskins did not share the 49ers’ regrets. Two days after Foster was cut, the Redskins claimed him off waivers. Williams, the team’s senior vice president of player personnel, said he hoped that Foster would turn himself around in Washington, where many of his former teammates from the University of Alabama play. “Nothing is promised to Reuben, but we are hopeful being around so many of his former teammates and friends will eventually provide him with the best possible environment to succeed both personally and professionally,” he said. Even after the Redskins were criticized for picking up Foster before his legal case played out, Williams said that he was still worth the hassle. “Basically what you’re doing here is you’re taking a high-risk chance,” Williams said. “The high risk was the beat-up that we’re going to take from the PR. We understood that from a PR standpoint, and we’re taking it.” The Chiefs were willing to take the criticism for Hunt’s actions in a hotel in Cleveland in February. But once the video surfaced, there was no other way to spin the story, no matter how valuable Hunt is to the Chiefs’ Super Bowl ambitions. “If it’s a particularly valuable player, they’ll cross their fingers and hope he changes his behavior,” said Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence who advised the league several years ago. “Sometimes crossing their fingers works, and sometimes it doesn’t.” Richard A.

sport Mike McCarthy Fired by Packers After Loss to Cardinals - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Mike McCarthy Fired by Packers After Loss to Cardinals Supported by Mike McCarthy Fired by Packers After Loss to Cardinals Image Mike McCarthy during the Packers’ loss to the Cardinals on Sunday.CreditCreditMike Roemer/Associated Press By Ken Belson Dec. 2, 2018 Their once-promising season in tatters, the Green Bay Packers fired Coach Mike McCarthy on Sunday and named Joe Philbin, the team’s offensive coordinator, as the interim coach. The announcement came after the Packers were upset by the visiting Arizona Cardinals, 20-17, ending McCarthy’s nearly 13-year run in Green Bay. “The 2018 season has not lived up to the expectations and standards of the Green Bay Packers,” the team president Mark Murphy said in a statement. “We will immediately begin the process of selecting the next head coach of the Green Bay Packers.” McCarthy, 55, had a 125-76-2 record, for a .621 winning percentage, since arriving in Green Bay in 2006. The Packers made the playoffs in nine of his seasons, and won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season. Only Curly Lambeau, the team’s original coach, led the team longer than McCarthy. McCarthy took over the Packers before quarterback Brett Favre’s next-to-last season in Green Bay, and tapped Aaron Rodgers, to take over when Favre departed. But at 4-7-1 this year, the Packers are in danger for missing the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Green Bay has lost three straight games and five of the last six, raising the pressure on McCarthy. Before arriving in Green Bay, McCarthy was a positions coach and offensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers, New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs. Philbin, 57, became the offensive coordinator this year. He was coach of the Miami Dolphins from 2012 to 2015, going 24-28. He was the Packers’ offensive coordinator for five seasons before that.

Happ, who went 7-0 after coming to the team in a mid-season trade.CreditCreditJulio Cortez/Associated Press By Billy Witz Dec. 12, 2018 LAS VEGAS — The last time the Yankees had to stew on the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series, they reacted by going on a free-agent bender — shelling out a total of $458 million for Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran five years ago. Their approach this off-season has been far more restrained. To fortify their greatest need — their starting rotation — they quickly re-signed C.C. Sabathia for one more season at $8 million, traded for talented but oft-injured James Paxton, and on Wednesday were closing in on landing a familiar face and a dependable arm — the left-hander J.A. Happ. Happ, 36, who spent the last three months of the season with the Yankees before becoming a free agent, has agreed to the framework of a deal — two years with a vesting option — that had not yet been finalized late Wednesday night, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it until it is signed. While the Yankees were unwilling to commit to a six-year contract for their top free-agent pitching target, Patrick Corbin, which would have carried through his age 35 season, Happ’s deal could take him through his age 38 season. A benchmark for Happ’s deal might be the two-year, $30 million deal that pitcher Charlie Morton agreed to with Tampa Bay earlier on Wednesday. The two pitchers, both American League All-Stars last season, present an interesting contrast. Morton has been injured frequently, including late in the season when a shoulder injury left his pitches lacking their usual finish, but he was dominant in the 2017 playoffs for the Houston Astros and through much of last season. Morton, 35, went 15-3 with a 3.13 E.R.A. in 2018. Happ, meanwhile, pitched poorly in his one playoff start for the Yankees last October, but otherwise was an anchor for a staff that was sorely in need of one when he was acquired from Toronto in late July. Happ was 7-0 with a 2.69 E.R.A. after being acquired, though those numbers may have been slightly flattering. His FIP, or Fielding Independent Pitching — an attempt to measure a pitcher’s effectiveness independent of his team’s fielding — was a middling 4.29. Still, over the last four seasons, Happ has been reliable wherever he has pitched — whether in Seattle, Pittsburgh, Toronto or New York. In those four years, he averaged 30 starts and went 58-29 with a 3.48 E.R.A. “He took the ball every five days, he was a competitor — came as advertised, a real pro,” Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said Wednesday night before an agreement had been reached. He added: “He knew exactly what was necessary and brought it every five days in the most competitive division in all of baseball. He checks all the boxes.” Cashman said that if he landed Happ, it would not preclude him from acquiring another starter, but that his focus would turn to landing a middle infielder to replace shortstop Didi Gregorius, who is expected to miss between three and five months while recovering from Tommy John surgery. While the market carries far more second base options — meaning the Yankees would move Gleyber Torres to shortstop temporarily — a more alluring option is Manny Machado, who could play shortstop until Gregorius returns and then slide over to third base. The Yankees are also trying to add to their bullpen. And while Cashman wondered aloud on Monday why reporters were continuing to ask him about Bryce Harper, the free-agent outfielder, when the Yankees had no need, he allowed on Wednesday — as Harper’s agent Scott Boras suggested — that circumstances could always change. “If something doesn’t make sense today, it doesn’t mean it won’t make sense tomorrow,” Cashman said. “So all I can keep telling you is you know where my current focuses are, but at the same time we’re a fully operational Death Star.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Yanks Near Deal to Keep Happ, a Trusty Lefty.

sport LeBron James gave Grizzlies manager his shoes after win Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? LeBron James surprised Grizzlies equipment manager with his shoes after win in Memphis Ryan YoungYahoo SportsDecember 9, 2018, 6:29 AM GMT Brian’e Miller showed up to work on Friday night at the FedEx Forum wearing a pair of LeBrons, just like she does for every Memphis Grizzlies game. What she didn’t know, though, was that she would end up leaving having met her favorite player. Scroll to continue with content Ad Miller is an assistant equipment manager for the Grizzlies, and a huge LeBron James fan. So, while she was collecting warm-up gear from the Los Angeles Lakers’ bench area late during their 111-88 win over the Grizzlies, James stopped her. He remembered her. “Every year I’ve come here, she’s always worn a very exclusive pair of my shoes and I’ve always noticed it and I’ve never said anything to her,” James told the Commercial Appeal. “And tonight, I said something to her for the first time and she was like, ‘Yeah, I’ve always been Team LeBron. Always.’ So she got a pair of LeBrons.” LeBron gave his game-work shoes to a woman who works for the Grizzlies. He hugged her late in the fourth quarter and she was very emotional. Here’s why. pic.twitter.com/VZVBheKxhi — Tania Ganguli (@taniaganguli) December 9, 2018 She didn’t just get a pair of LeBrons. She got the purple shoes he was wearing in the game that night.

That’s the thing. I’m not a fan just when LeBron comes. I’m a fan when he’s not looking, so it was just really cool to see him appreciate me.” And while Miller has seen nearly every player in the league up close during her time as an equipment manager with the Grizzlies, Saturday night’s interaction marked one she won’t forget anytime soon. “Priceless,” Miller told the Commercial Appeal. “I wasn’t expecting that, to come to work today and I’m going to get LeBron’s shoes. I’m just always trying to make the Lakers, or any team he’s on, comfortable because I know it’s hectic. It’s just trying to do my job and he blessed me with a pair of shoes.” LeBron James gave a Memphis Grizzlies equipment manager — who happens to be one of his biggest fans — his shoes from the Lakers’ game against the Grizzlies on Saturday.

MLB rumors: Red Sox didn't find Jackie Bradley Jr. trade to their liking originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.com The Boston Red Sox need to figure out which of their upcoming free agents in 2019 and 2020 to pay long-term, and that's going to create a lot of tough decisions. The Sox could get ahead of those decisions by trading one or more of their veterans who are up for free agency in the near future. One of those players with free agency on the horizon is outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr., and The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reported Saturday that Boston looked at trading the 2018 American League Championship Series MVP but didn't find a package that made sense. Scroll to continue with content Ad Left-hander Chris Sale, righty Rick Porcello, shortstop Xander Bogaerts and designated hitter J.D. Martinez are eligible for free agency after the 2019 season (Martinez if he opts out). Outfielders Mookie Betts and Jackie Bradley are scheduled to hit the open market after ‘20. The Red Sox will not retain all of those players, in part due to ongoing payroll concerns. Talk surfaced at the winter meetings that the team was willing to trade Porcello, Bogaerts or Bradley to clear money, perhaps for bullpen help. A source said the Sox pushed Bradley the hardest, but did not find a deal they liked. Bradley is an elite defensive player but can be frustratingly inconsistent at the plate. His batting average, home runs and RBI totals have declined in each of the last two years from his career-best 2016 season. He did come up clutch a few times in the 2018 postseason to help the Red Sox win the World Series. He tallied nine RBI in the ALCS, which Boston won in five games over the Houston Astros. Story continues If the Red Sox don't plan on re-signing Bradley when it's time for his next contract, they might as well move him and try to replenish a farm system that's been depleted as a result of trades for Craig Kimbrel, Chris Sale and others.  Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

sport For M.L.S., Atlanta-Portland Final Is a Perfect Fit for Its Stage - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Soccer Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Soccer|For M.L.S., Atlanta-Portland Final Is a Perfect Fit for Its Stage Supported by For M.L.S., Atlanta-Portland Final Is a Perfect Fit for Its Stage Image Atlanta United’s Josef Martinez, who set the M.L.S. single-season goals record this year.CreditCreditCurtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution, via Associated Press By Joel Petterson Dec. 7, 2018 ATLANTA — In the adolescent years of Major League Soccer, its championship game did not always feel like a spectacle. In those days, the M.L.S. Cup was held at neutral sites before most teams had fan bases willing to travel en masse, and the pockets of empty seats and the mosaic of random jerseys in the stadiums didn’t exactly create a sense of grandeur. It would be hard to imagine a bigger contrast, then, with what is now being promised in Saturday night’s 23rd M.L.S. Cup, when the Portland Timbers will visit Atlanta United with the league title at stake. M.L.S., which stopped using neutral sites for its final after the 2011 game, could hardly have drawn up a better setting: the league’s two top teams — and its past two most valuable players — squaring off inside the year-old Mercedes-Benz Stadium, its stands packed with more than 70,000 fans wearing the colors of a brash, second-year team that has jolted the league with both its style of play and its next-generation (for M.L.S., at least) business model. “It’s going to be incredible,” said Arthur Blank, who owns both Atlanta United and its gleaming new arena. “For our fans. Really, for soccer in North America.” Adding to the atmosphere will be the fact that about 2,000 Timbers supporters are expected to be on hand as well, making them the largest traveling contingent for a final that many in the league can remember. Many of the Timbers supporters will have traveled from the opposite corner of the country this week, ready to give full-throated reminders to their hosts that they have been singing chants and winning games — and trophies — since before Atlanta United existed. For a league always striving to carve out a bigger stake in the American sports landscape, this moment — two of M.L.S.’s most popular and successful teams meeting on what is unquestionably the league’s biggest stage — is an exquisite bit of serendipity. “It is not often that a league can celebrate a leading goal-scorer of all-time, an M.V.P., a record-setting fan base, and just clutter-breaking excitement with one team in one market,” the M.L.S. commissioner, Don Garber, said in an interview this week. Image Portland’s Dairon Asprilla after the team beat Sporting Kansas City in the Western Conference finals.CreditJay Biggerstaff/USA Today Sports, via Reuters Atlanta enters the final as a heavy favorite, and for reasons obvious to anyone who followed the league this season. It finished two points shy of the top record in the league, the product of a fluid and aggressively attacking style instilled by its Argentine coach, Gerardo Martino. It features the league’s top player, Josef Martínez, the Venezuelan striker who won M.V.P. honors this week after smashing the league’s single-season goals record with 31 this season, as well as a teammate who could soon prove even more valuable: the gifted Paraguayan midfielder Miguel Almirón, who could soon break the league’s transfer record if a whispered move to the Premier League goes through in January. On the other side of the field is a Portland team that, while it may not be able to match Atlanta’s average attendance numbers (figures that, the league boasts often, fall somewhere between the crowds at home games for Liverpool and Manchester City) or roster spending, has long been a darling of M.L.S. The Timbers, the 2015 M.L.S. champions, have sold out their stadium for every home game since joining the league in 2011. “While I’m incredibly excited by what’s going on in Atlanta,” Garber said, “they’re playing against a team in Portland that has had that approach from the very beginning.” Regardless of how Saturday’s match goes, Portland has already claimed a social media victory this week; on Sunday, it tweaked Atlanta United on Twitter after catching the newcomers using a file photo of Portland’s 2015 championship trophy to promote the game. And as it did in its 2015 run, Portland has proved to be a tough opponent on the road this postseason. Led by the 2017 M.V.P., Diego Valeri, it has scored seven goals in three games away from Providence Park in the postseason. And while the first-year Portland coach Giovanni Savarese might not have the international pedigree of Martino, who previously coached Barcelona and Argentina’s national team, he is in his sixth final in seven years after making five in his last job, with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. When the two teams played to a 1-1 draw in June, Portland deployed an extra defender to slow Martínez and Almirón, and Martino said Friday that he expected a similar dynamic in the final. “We as a team expect to have the initiative, and we expect Portland to cede that to us,” Martino said through a translator during a conference call on Monday. “So we plan to be aggressive.” Image Record crowds and Atlanta United’s high-scoring attack have Mercedes-Benz Stadium a tough place to win for opponents.CreditJason Getz/USA Today Sports, via Reuters There are contrasts off the field, too, despite both clubs’ reputations for large and dedicated fan bases — something not every M.L.S. team can boast. Portland has benefited from a rich local soccer history, dating to the Timbers’ roots as an N.A.S.L. team in the 1970s. Atlanta seems to have burst out of nowhere — a result of careful planning since the franchise’s founding and a focus on nurturing the team’s fan culture long before the squad’s first player was signed. Through different paths, it has all added up — for both teams — to something M.L.S. has long sought: true resonance in their respective cities. That is not lost on the players who have been part of it. “The game itself is going to be special because, I think, it’s going to have a sparkling atmosphere, you know?” said the veteran Atlanta defender Jeff Larentowicz, who is playing in his fifth M.L.S. Cup. “In the past, it hasn’t always been that way.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: M.L.S. Dream Final: Full Arena, Wild Fans.

sport Mets Bring Back Familia, This Time to Pitch the 8th Inning Instead of the 9th - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Mets Bring Back Familia, This Time to Pitch the 8th Inning Instead of the 9th Supported by Mets Bring Back Familia, This Time to Pitch the 8th Inning Instead of the 9th Image Jeurys Familia is coming back to the Mets.CreditCreditJulie Jacobson/Associated Press By James Wagner Dec. 13, 2018 LAS VEGAS — Sometimes it just takes one big deal for the dam to break. And late Wednesday night, during baseball’s annual winter meetings, that deal apparently arrived when reliever Jeurys Familia decided to return to the Mets for a contract worth $30 million over three years. Soon after, Joe Kelly agreed to a three-year, $25 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team he tortured during the World Series while pitching in relief for the Boston Red Sox. The remaining dominoes in a saturated market for relief pitchers — including big names like Craig Kimbrel, Zach Britton and Andrew Miller — may now follow suit and shortly sign new deals, too. But it was the Mets, who have taken an aggressive approach under their new general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen, who pounced first. Familia, who left the Mets for the Oakland Athletics in a trade in July, probably will not be formally reintroduced as a Met until early next week because he still has to pass a physical. Nor will he be the Mets’ closer, as he had been before he departed. But Van Wagenen, careful to couch his words because the deal was still pending, was clearly happy that the Mets now have a talented, and experienced, reliever in place to serve as the setup man for the team’s new closer, the recently acquired Edwin Diaz. A Mets bullpen that was among the worst in baseball last season has clearly been fortified. “Age, performance, repertoire and comfort with someone who is able to fit in our market and our team,” Van Wagenen said Thursday, listing the reasons the Mets wanted Familia to return. Familia, who is 29, was the youngest of the top free-agent relievers on the market this winter. He posted a 3.13 earned run average and 18 saves in 72 innings last season between the Mets and Oakland. In seven years as a Met, he amassed 123 saves and a 2.66 E.R.A. and was named an All-Star in 2016. From 2014 to mid-2018, he was, for the most part, a durable, reliable member of the Mets’ bullpen. But his 2017 season was cut short because of a 15-game suspension related to a domestic violence incident and by blood-clot surgery in his throwing shoulder. In the midst of a disappointing 2018 campaign, the Mets traded Familia to the contending Athletics for salary relief, two prospects and international bonus pool money. Even then, Familia, who signed with the Mets at 17 out of his native Dominican Republic, hoped to return. Relief pitchers can be unpredictable from season to season, but the Mets are banking that their intimate knowledge of Familia will make it easier for him to have a successful 2019, although this time as a setup man. “The better you know the player, the more comfortable you are with getting the performance that you’re projecting,” Van Wagenen said. Despite the additions of Diaz and Familia, the underbelly of the Mets’ bullpen is still a question mark. While Seth Lugo and Robert Gsellman are viewed as capable options, several other relievers — Tyler Bashlor, Jacob Rhame, Paul Sewald and Drew Smith — are seen as less so. And Daniel Zamora is the only left-handed relief pitcher currently on the team’s major league roster, and his experience in the big leagues consists of the 16 games he pitched for the Mets last season. Van Wagenen is still seeking to add a catcher and an outfielder to the Mets’ roster but said that he also hoped to keep improving the bullpen this off-season — although with pitchers that will cost less than Familia did. The Mets acquired Diaz this month as part of a trade with the Seattle Mariners that also returned second baseman Robinson Cano. As for Kelly, who is 30, he had a 4.33 E.R.A. in four and a half seasons with the Red Sox, but he saved his best performances in Boston for 2018. He brawled with the Yankees’ Tyler Austin in April — earning a suspension but also folk-hero status in Boston — and was superb in all five games of the World Series, throwing six shutout innings with no walks and 10 strikeouts. He was a key factor, and a surprising one, in Boston’s championship run. Kelly, who went to high school and college in Riverside County, Calif., east of Los Angeles, should help stabilize a Dodgers setup group that faltered against the Red Sox. In turn, the Red Sox, who also expect to lose Kimbrel in free agency, said they were not planning to spend heavily in the bullpen, although the departure of Kelly, and presumably Kimbrel, will surely sting. “We feel comfortable with the guys that we have out there,” said Dave Dombrowski, Boston’s president of baseball operations. “Are we open-minded to add people? Yes. But we’re not going to be big-expenditure people at this point in the relief market. Our payroll’s pretty high right now.” The Red Sox retained starter Nathan Eovaldi last week with a four-year, $68 million contract. Boston had a payroll of more than $230 million last season, which was the highest in baseball, and could be at that figure again in 2019 after projected raises through salary arbitration.

AP More On: the 5th quarter Insane flip proves how much fight Seahawks have left The Redskins are in new hands after Alex Smith's injury Bill Belichick's former players are becoming his kryptonite Saints and Rams may have only been a preview of what's to come Anyone interested in coaching Aaron Rodgers? The head job in Green Bay opened up Sunday evening, shortly after the Packers fell to the Cardinals, 20-17 on a missed field goal by Mason Crosby to end the game. It was the Packers’ third straight loss and fifth in six weeks. After 13 seasons in his position and 125 wins, including a Super Bowl, the soundtrack to McCarthy’s final day at Lambeau Field included boos from the crowd. “I did not do a good enough job,” McCarthy said after the game but before he was informed of his dismissal. “We did not do a good enough job as a football team.” Management laid all the blame at McCarthy’s feet. “The 2018 season has not lived up to the expectations and standards of the Green Bay Packers,” team president Mark Murphy said in a statement. “As a result, I made the difficult decision to relieve Mike McCarthy of his role as head coach, effective immediately.” Now 4-7-1, the Packers will be led in the interim by Joe Philbin, the offensive coordinator and a former head coach of the Dolphins. The job will be attractive for prospective hires as Rodgers remains under contract. In McCarthy’s final game, Rodgers, who won that Super Bowl title with McCarthy in 2011, was 31-of-50 for 233 yards and a touchdown. It was not enough to keep McCarthy on the job as Arizona (3-9) picked up its first win since Oct. 28. see also Packers fire Mike McCarthy after stunning loss After 13 seasons and one Super Bowl, it was a... “Mike has been a terrific head coach and leader of the Packers for 13 seasons, during which time we experienced a great deal of success on and off the field,” Murphy said. “We will immediately begin the process of selecting the next head coach of the Green Bay Packers.” There will be plenty of parties interested in McCarthy, as well. He reached the playoffs in nine of his 13 seasons with the Packers, but failed to keep pace with the Bears and Vikings this season. The Packers were already preparing to move on. The only surprise was Murphy made his dismissal with four weeks left in the season. Hot in Texas When it was over — after Houston linebacker Zach Cunningham recorded a pick-six, tailback Lamar Miller rushed for more than 100 yards and the Texans beat the Browns, 29-13 — wideout DeAndre Hopkins reflected on a ninth straight win. “It means a lot, especially from where we came from at 0-3,” he said, “but it’s not the Super Bowl. So we keep on fighting.” No one saw Hopkins or Houston as Super Bowl contenders after Week 3, but here they are, the hottest team in the NFL. The Giants — of all teams — beat the Texans, 27-22, in late September to leave Houston winless at 0-3. What appeared to be rock bottom proved to be a launching pad as the Texans have won every game since to improve to 9-3. They have done it with an opportunistic defense anchored by J.J. Watt and Jadeveon Clowney and an offense led by the battery of quarterback Deshaun Watson and Hopkins, who went for 91 yards on Sunday. Fresh off the best game of his career, Baker Mayfield was limited by the Texans as he completed 29-of-43 passes for 397 yards and four interceptions. “He probably wasn’t feeling too dangerous in the first half,” Watt said, “but he was feeling a little more dangerous in the second half.” DeAndre HopkinsAP Third time’s a Charge’ Rare is the team that jumps offsides three times in a row, but that was the case at the end of the Chargers’ 33-30 win in Pittsburgh. Los Angeles kicker Michael Badgley missed his first attempt at a game winner but was given another chance when offsides was called. The second attempt was blocked, but offsides was called again. He nailed his third try as an offsides penalty was called once more. Los Angeles declined the penalty to accept victory. It all capped a late comeback by the Chargers, who trailed 23-7 at the half and didn’t gain a lead until the fourth quarter. Quarterback Philip Rivers finished with 299 yards and converted a pair of two-point conversions down the stretch to lead the Chargers to victory. Los Angeles (9-3) proved it can compete with the Steelers (7-4-1) and anyone else in the AFC for the right to play the Patriots or Chiefs in January. If given three tries to kick a game winner, Los Angeles sure seems fit to compete come playoff time. Jagtime dandy The Andrew Luck Revival Tour endured its first big blow Sunday when the Colts failed to score a point in a 6-0 loss to the Jaguars. Luck completed 33-of-52 passes for 248 yards, but the Jaguars pounced on him often with three sacks and an interception. “I didn’t feel very sharp,” Luck said. “I didn’t feel I was putting the ball in the right places to give the guys a chance to catch them, but again, give credit to their coverage. I think all the guys in the locker room right now feel that we didn’t hold up our end of the bargain as players. I know I can be sharper. I know I need to be sharper. I’m discouraged, but in a sense I’m also encouraged to get back to work and improve on things.” The Colts are now 6-6 and will need help to reach the playoffs. It gets no easier as a road game in Houston awaits next week. Battering Ram Maybe he felt at home with the name Lombardi appearing everywhere in Green Bay, but that was former Fordham running back Chase Edmonds churning his way to 53 yards — a career high — and a pair of touchdowns on five carries in Arizona’s victory at Lambeau Field. Edmonds broke free for a 29-yard run and received three carries inside Green Bay’s 10-yard line, scoring twice. Play of the Day It was first-and-10 with the Lions looking to score on the Rams’ 11-yard line. Quarterback Matthew Stafford took the snap under center, dropped back and faked a handoff. Lined up at left tackle, Taylor Decker blocked for a second before rolling out to his left and looking back for Stafford, who swung the ball out to him. The Rams were completely fooled as Decker ran toward the goal line with his right hand raised in celebration before he scored. Once over the goal line, Decker threw the ball in the stands. Detroit pulled within a field goal, but failed to duplicate the magic as the Rams won, 30-16. Three Stars Broncos running back Phillip Lindsay carries the ball against the Bengals on Sunday.AP 1. Phillip Lindsay: The rookie was off and running for the Broncos when he broke off a 65-yard scamper, and his 157 yards were a career high as Denver stayed alive in the playoff chase with a 24-10 win over Cincinnati. 2. Andrew Adams: Tampa’s safety played catch with Carolina quarterback Cam Newton, picking him off three times. Adams joined Aqib Talib and Ronde Barber as the only two other Bucs to pull off the defensive hat trick. Tampa tallied four interceptions on the day. 3. Travis Kelce: The Wrestler in Chief hauled in 12 catches for 168 yards and a pair of touchdowns in a 40-33 win over Oakland. To celebrate his first score, he got up from the ground and performed a Stone Cold Stunner on fullback Anthony Sherman. Quote of the Day “You called me a b—h, though. I’ll catch you. Trust me, I’ll catch you. I’ll catch you. Guaranteed.” — Bills defensive end Jerry Hughes to an official in the tunnel beneath the stands at Hard Rock Stadium after Buffalo fell to Miami, 21-17 Fantasy Insanity Browns WR Antonio Callaway had a ho-hum fantasy day (three catches, 84 yards, one fumble, 9.4 PPR points). But it could have been much better. He caught a 76-yard touchdown pass that was called back. Two plays later, he hauled in a 71-yard catch and was on his way into the end zone before fumbling at the 2. That type of explosiveness demands a spot on fantasy rosters. The Cardinals shocked the Packers despite little from David Johnson (20-for-69 rushing, 1-for-3 receiving, 8.2 PPR points). Chase Edmonds, however, had 5-for-53 rushing with two TDs and 2-13 receiving (20.6 points). Worse, both Edmonds TDs came on runs inside the 10. If Johnson is not going to be used near the goal line, that is a huge blow to his fantasy prospects. We are expecting bad news regarding injuries to Bengals WR A.J. Green and Panthers TE Greg Olsen. Track down Buffalo’s Zay Jones to replace Green. Olsen backup Ian Thomas is as good as any on a barren TE waiver wire. — Drew Loftis Share this: Facebook Twitter Flipboard WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under green bay packers ,  mike mccarthy ,  the 5th quarter Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Flipboard WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Sam Darnold's return doesn't sound far off Read Next Sam Darnold's return doesn't sound far off Share Selection Columnists Larry Brooks Who's next now that Rangers honored Vic Hadfield?

sport M.L.B. Extends TV Deal With Fox Sports Through 2028 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|M.L.B. Extends TV Deal With Fox Sports Through 2028 Supported by M.L.B. Extends TV Deal With Fox Sports Through 2028 Image Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, was given a contract extension at the owners’ meetings this week.CreditCreditJohn Raoux/Associated Press By James Wagner Nov. 15, 2018 Even in the age of streaming and cord-cutting, live sports still carry a big price tag for broadcasters. On Thursday, Major League Baseball and Fox Sports announced they had extended their national television rights agreement. The terms were not disclosed, but two people with direct knowledge of the deal said it was for seven years, through the 2028 season, and $5.1 billion. That is a significant increase over the current deal with Fox, which expires after the 2021 season and was for eight years and $4.2 billion, according to the Sports Business Journal. Bloomberg was the first to report the value of the new deal. Fox has been a national M.L.B. television rights holder since 1996 and became an exclusive national broadcaster four years later. Each year, Fox airs Saturday regular season games, the All-Star Game, and several playoff series, including the World Series. The company also broadcasts games in Spanish on Fox Deportes. The new deal calls for Fox to expand its digital baseball programming and to increase the number of regular season and postseason games broadcast starting in 2022. The average viewership for this year’s World Series, which the Boston Red Sox won in five games over the Los Angeles Dodgers, dropped by 23 percent from the 2017 World Series between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros, which lasted seven games. M.L.B. also has media rights deals with Facebook, ESPN and Turner Sports. Its current contracts with ESPN (worth $5.6 billion) and Turner Sports ($2.6 billion) run through 2021. The new television deal was part of a flurry of announcements from the M.L.B. owners’ meetings in Atlanta. M.L.B. and the players’ union also said they had reached an agreement to relax rules governing the footwear worn by players during games. In response to players’ calls for more leeway in expressing themselves on the diamond, the majority of each shoe will no longer be required to be the team’s designated primary color. Instead, players can wear shoes with the following, in any proportion: black, white, and gray; any colors on the players’ uniform; and any additional colors set by their team. “Players welcome the expanded opportunity to express themselves and engage with fans through innovative design,” Tony Clark, the executive director of the players’ union, said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing their creativity and individuality on the field in 2019.” Beginning in 2017, players were given a taste of more freedom — but only for one weekend. On Players Weekend, as it was called, they chose nicknames for their jerseys and wore whatever cleats they designed. Some players have pushed the limits with their cleats, even finding designers online to paint unique designs. This season, Cleveland’s Mike Clevinger and Chicago’s Ben Zobrist complained publicly about stern warnings or discipline they received from M.L.B. over their cleat choice or designs. One reason players, not to mention shoe companies, embraced Players Weekend is that M.L.B. has fallen behind in player promotion and self-expression, compared to other professional leagues, particularly the N.B.A. “We believe that this agreement strikes the appropriate balance between the shared goal of permitting players to express their individuality while maintaining reasonable restrictions on shoe colors and designs,” M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. Among the other announcements Thursday, M.L.B. said it had struck a new deal beginning next season with DAZN, an international sports streaming service launched in 2016, for a daily highlights and live look-in show. The deal is for three years and reportedly worth $300 million. DAZN’s efforts were led by John Skipper, the former ESPN president who resigned abruptly last December. In addition to the content deals, M.L.B. owners voted to give Manfred, 60, a five-year extension, through the 2024 season. Manfred was elected commissioner in August 2014 and officially replaced Bud Selig that following January. Under Manfred, the league has posted record profits, enacted pace of play measures, focused on youth and international growth, and negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement with the players’ union that went into effect in 2017. Before becoming commissioner, Manfred was M.L.B.’s chief operating officer with experience in labor relations and strengthening baseball’s drug testing program.

sport Cardinals Acquire Paul Goldschmidt Hoping He Can Fill Albert Pujols’s Shoes - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Cardinals Acquire Paul Goldschmidt Hoping He Can Fill Albert Pujols’s Shoes Supported by Cardinals Acquire Paul Goldschmidt Hoping He Can Fill Albert Pujols’s Shoes Image Paul Goldschmidt played 1,092 games for the Arizona Diamondbacks, slugging 209 home runs.CreditCreditRick Scuteri/Associated Press By Tyler Kepner Dec. 5, 2018 Paul Goldschmidt was a high school senior, watching from the upper deck in Houston, when Albert Pujols blasted a titanic home run for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2005 National League Championship Series. The Cardinals had been one out from elimination, but the great Pujols saved them. St. Louis would lose that series, but Pujols went on to lead them to two World Series titles in later years. “I had a good view,” Goldschmidt said in an interview a few years ago. “It was crazy. I was like every fan there. I was upset.” Goldschmidt rooted for the Astros then, and before long he would become an All-Star first baseman for the Arizona Diamondbacks. But with one year to go before he hits free agency, the downsizing Diamondbacks traded Goldschmidt on Wednesday to the Cardinals, who finally found a fearsome slugger to replace Pujols in the middle of their lineup. In exchange for Goldschmidt, the Diamondbacks acquired starter Luke Weaver, catcher Carson Kelly, the Class AA infielder Andrew Young and a competitive-balance round B draft pick in 2019. Weaver was 7-11 with a 4.95 earned run average last season, and while Kelly has hit only .154 in the majors, he was blocked by Yadier Molina in St. Louis and has ranked among baseball’s best prospects. The Cardinals’ last title came in 2011, Pujols’s final season before leaving for the Los Angeles Angels in free agency. The Cardinals did not suffer immediately, reaching the postseason four times after he departed and winning the National League pennant in 2013. But last season was the Cardinals’ third in a row without a playoff appearance, and they have badly needed an offensive force. Pujols played 11 seasons for the Cardinals, always hitting at least 30 homers with an on-base plus slugging percentage of .900 or better. Since then, no Cardinal has reached those levels in the same season. Goldschmidt has done it four times, including last season, when he had 33 homers and a .922 O.P.S. Image Goldschmidt, who was a fan of the Houston Astros while he was growing up, was in the crowd in 2005 when Albert Pujols extended the National League Championship series with a mammoth home run of Brad Lidge.CreditHarry Cabluck/Associated Press Even so, the Cardinals had a fairly productive offense last season and rallied from a slow start to go 88-74, the best record of any non-playoff team in the National League. The Diamondbacks had an opposite itinerary: after leading the N.L. West at the start of September, they lost 19 of 27 games in that month to finish 82-80. The Diamondbacks lost J.D. Martinez in free agency to the Boston Red Sox last winter, and this week lost an All-Star starter, Patrick Corbin, to the Washington Nationals as a free agent. Center fielder A.J. Pollock, a former All-Star who is also a free agent, may be the next to leave. Diamondbacks General Manager Mike Hazen called Wednesday a bittersweet day, suggesting that Goldschmidt was “possibly the best player in the National League” and acknowledging that he was the franchise’s most visible star. He said the Cardinals’ package would help fortify a thin base of talent. “We’ve worked pretty hard to try to build that talent infrastructure,” said Hazen, who was hired in October 2016. “We don’t feel like it’s where it needs to be. I think we’re still talking about a bottom-10 farm system in baseball. That’s something we’re working aggressively to try to improve to be able to sustain success, not just get there for any one year.” The Diamondbacks never advanced past the division series with Goldschmidt in the lineup, despite adding the ace starter Zack Greinke for six years and $206.5 million before the 2016 season. That deal gives Greinke the highest average annual salary in the majors ($34.4 million), and while Hazen said he did not envision “a rash of trades,” it stands to reason that he will also move Greinke if he can. As for the Cardinals, they have tried and failed in recent years to lure superstars for the long term, pursuing David Price and Jason Heyward in free agency and Giancarlo Stanton in a trade. While they could not persuade Heyward to stay after a one-season cameo, they once had a knack for retaining stars who arrived without a long-term contract, like Mark McGwire, Jim Edmonds and Matt Holliday. Keeping Goldschmidt will be their next challenge. But for next season, at least, the Cardinals should finally have the run producer they have been missing.

Tony Parker scored 16 points, Marvin Williams had 13 and Cody Zeller finished with 12 as Charlotte led by as many as 28 points in a game it never trailed. The rookie Kevin Knox tied a season high with 26 points and set a career high with 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who lost their fourth in a row. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 21 points. Allonzo Trier, who strained his left hamstring in Saturday’s loss to the Nets, did not play. Lamb’s layup with 8 minutes 50 seconds left in the third quarter gave the Hornets their biggest lead, 77-49. The Knicks pulled to 18 behind on Knox’s 3-pointer before Walker’s long 3 pushed the lead to 99-78 heading to the fourth. The Knicks opened the final quarter with a 7-0 run to pull to 14 behind on Frank Ntilikina’s jumper with 10:47 remaining. But the Hornets scored the next 12 points to put the game out of reach. During that run, Ntilikina, who finished with 18 points — all in the second half — fouled out with nine minutes left and Knicks Coach David Fizdale was given two technical fouls and ejected with 8:33 remaining. Zeller scored 10 points in the first quarter as the Hornets opened up a pair of seven-point leads. Parker came off the bench to score eight and Charlotte led, 27-24, after the first 12 minutes. The Hornets opened the second quarter with a 7-0 run, but the Knicks responded by scoring the next six points to pull to 34-30. The Hornets followed with an 18-4 stretch to take an 18-point lead.

sport Ravens and Eagles Claw Their Way to the N.F.L. Playoffs - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Ravens and Eagles Claw Their Way to the N.F.L. Playoffs Supported by Ravens and Eagles Claw Their Way to the N.F.L. Playoffs Image Lamar Jackson ran for two touchdowns against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, helping the Baltimore Ravens clinch the A.F.C. North.CreditCreditRob Carr/Getty Images By Benjamin Hoffman Dec. 30, 2018 Lamar Jackson did not start for the Ravens until Week 11. Nick Foles did not take over the Eagles’ offense until Week 15. But after leading their teams to huge wins on Sunday, both former backup quarterbacks are headed to the playoffs. And partly as a result of those wins, Kirk Cousins and Ben Roethlisberger had their seasons come to unexpectedly early ends. Week 17 was chaotic by design. The N.F.L. had rearranged its schedule to maximize the drama, with the battles for the A.F.C. North and the N.F.C.’s second wild-card slot all happening concurrently, and it delivered thrills, indeed — even if not all the games were entirely close. When the dust settled after the late-afternoon games, Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens had captured the A.F.C. North by barely hanging on to beat the Cleveland Browns, 26-24. The defending champion Philadelphia Eagles earned a wild-card spot with a 24-0 win over the Washington Redskins combined with the Minnesota Vikings’ 24-10 loss to the Chicago Bears — though Philadelphia’s win came with some worrying news, as Foles left the game in the fourth quarter with a chest injury. Roethlisberger and the Steelers, after beating the Cincinnati Bengals by 16-13, were left with the slimmest of playoff chances: They needed the night game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Tennessee Titans to end in a tie. When the Colts won that game by 33-17, thus securing the final wild-card spot in the A.F.C., the Steelers were out. There were plenty of other consequential results in the regular season’s final weekend Sunday — the Kansas City Chiefs clinched home field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs and the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams both clinched first-round byes — but all of that paled in comparison to the shocking turnarounds for the Ravens and Eagles. Image Jimmy Smith’s interception in the first quarter helped set the tone in a strong effort by the Ravens’ defense.CreditPatrick Smith/Getty Images Ravens 26, Browns 24 Back in Week 9, the Ravens’ season seemed finished. They were 4-5 after a loss to the Steelers, and it was considered a matter of time before Coach John Harbaugh would be fired. After that game, Roethlisberger, whose team improved to 5-2-1, talked like a quarterback on his way to a Super Bowl. “We feel that we can do what we want to do,” he said. “We’ve got roadblocks, which are great defenses on other teams, trying to stop us, but we’ve always said — and no disrespect to other teams — they don’t stop us, we stop ourselves.” Roethlisberger clearly did not see Jackson coming, but, in the quarterback’s defense, neither did Harbaugh. Peppered with questions the next day as to whether he would stick with Joe Flacco as his quarterback, Harbaugh, who coached Flacco and the Ravens to a win in Super Bowl XLVII, brushed off the inquiries as ridiculous. “Joe has played well,” Harbaugh insisted, “So I don’t want to get into all of that. We’re rolling right now with what we got.” Apparently unknown to Harbaugh at the time was the fact that Flacco was nursing a hip injury. He did not throw another pass for Baltimore this season, sitting at first because of the injury and then because of Jackson’s brilliant play. Jackson, a 21-year-old who was taken with the 32d overall pick in this year’s draft, took over under center and refashioned the team’s offense into something the N.F.L. had not seen in decades. Over the season’s final seven games, he and running back Gus Edwards, also a rookie, led an offense that generated an incredible 1,607 rushing yards (an average of 229.6 a game), outgaining their opponents in that regard by 1,178 yards, which according to Stats Inc. set a record for the largest margin over seven weeks in the Super Bowl era. Even Michael Vick was questioning the Ravens’ reliance on quarterback runs, but it worked, leading to a 6-1 record and a division title that seemed unimaginable seven weeks ago. On Sunday it was no different, with Jackson coming out on top against Cleveland’s Baker Mayfield, the quarterback who was taken 31 picks before him in the draft. Mayfield’s play this season has given Cleveland plenty of reason for optimism going forward, but Mayfield, who set a rookie record for touchdown passes with 27, was outmatched by Jackson, who had 90 of his team’s outrageous 296 rushing yards and threw for another 179. It was the Ravens’ punishing defense, however, that sealed the win when C.J. Mosely intercepted Mayfield with just under a minute remaining in the game and the Browns creeping toward field-goal range. It was a bookend for the interception Baltimore had snagged on Mayfield’s first pass of the game, and one of three turnovers generated by the defense. Harbaugh gushed about his team after the game, saying that in terms of actual teamwork it was the best squad he had ever been associated with. “If you wanted to write a book about this season, I think no one would believe it,” he said. Image Nick Foles was forced out of the game with a chest injury in the second half, but he helped lead the Philadelphia Eagles to a win over the Washington Redskins.CreditMark Tenally/Associated Press Eagles 24, Redskins 0 Foles and the Eagles had less to be nervous about as they rolled over Washington to earn a playoff berth — at least until the quarterback left the game with an injury. Like Baltimore, Philadelphia appeared to be doomed after an injury to its starting quarterback this season. The Eagles were 6-7 after a Week 14 loss to Dallas, and shortly afterward it was announced that Carson Wentz would be out indefinitely with a fractured vertebrae in his back. But just like he did last season in his race to being named Super Bowl M.V.P., Foles seamlessly transitioned into the offense in place of Wentz. He threw for 270 yards in a shocking win over the Rams, and threw for 471 yards and four touchdowns in an even more-stunning win over the Texans. On Sunday he was less spectacular but still passed for 221 yards and two touchdowns in a win over the Redskins, though he had to exit with a chest injury in the fourth quarter. Regardless of the severity of Foles’s injury, Malcolm Jenkins, Philadelphia’s outspoken safety, was confident heading into next week’s wild-card round. “We’re not sneaking in. We’re here to do some damage,” Jenkins said. During his postgame news conference, Foles indicated that the extent of the injury had yet to be determined. “I’m sore right now,” he said. “We’ll find out what’s going on tomorrow. Tomorrow’s a big day.” In Foles’s absence, Nate Sudfeld, Philadelphia’s third-string quarterback, threw the first touchdown pass of his career. Even with Sunday’s win, which was powered mostly by Philadelphia’s defense and Washington’s general ineptitude, the Eagles needed help to get into the playoffs — and they got it from the Bears, who limited Cousins to just 132 passing yards in a game in which Chicago was locked into the No. 3 seed in the N.F.C. regardless of the result. Minnesota’s loss was the conclusion to an uneven season for Cousins and the Vikings. After last year’s appearance in the N.F.C. championship game, Minnesota tried to get to the next level by adding Cousins as a high-priced free agent. Instead, a regression by the team’s defense and an inconsistent effort from Cousins and the offense left them out of the playoffs entirely. Playoff Seedings A.F.C. 1. Kansas City Chiefs, 12-4, A.F.C.

sport The Secret Tennis Past of a Basketball Lifer - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Tennis Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Tennis|The Secret Tennis Past of a Basketball Lifer Supported by The Secret Tennis Past of a Basketball Lifer Image Tom Konchalski, center, with his uncle John Coman, right, at the West Side Tennis Club in the 1980s. Coman, a longtime tennis umpire, coaxed his nephew to try it.CreditCredit By Kevin Armstrong Sept. 7, 2018 Tom Konchalski still keeps a close eye on the courts where he once worked. At 71 and self-employed, Konchalski is best known as the publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated, a scouting newsletter for coaches that he produces, in large part, from his home on the 19th floor of a Queens high-rise. What many people don’t know about Konchalski is that he was once a linesman at the United States Open and that nostalgia is the reason he moved into this apartment three decades ago. Hints of his life in tennis dot the crowded space. He keeps a Dunlop Maxply Fort, the wooden racket his hero, Lew Hoad, used when he played, amid the reams of paper documenting onetime basketball prospects like Connie Hawkins, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. To step onto Konchalski’s terrace is to trek back decades. He overlooks the West Side Tennis Club, the exclusive world where, at 21, he worked as a linesman during Arthur Ashe’s Open semifinal in 1968. These days, it’s common to hear music from summer concerts rising from the courts below. “They had Bob Dylan two summers ago, they had Paul Simon,” he said. “I can look into the stadium. They’re not all sellouts.” Judging balls in or out was Konchalski’s second choice when he first sought work in tennis. His uncle John Coman was an umpire. In 1955, he gave Konchalski, then 8 and living in Elmhurst, Queens, a ticket to the Davis Cup at Forest Hills. Konchalski went the first day and watched Hoad defeat Tony Trabert in a singles match. When he turned 13, he checked to see if he could be a ball boy. He could not. It was a paid post, and he needed to be 14 to acquire working papers. Coman suggested Konchalski become an umpire the next year instead, and he did. A few years later, in 1962, Konchalski worked the championship match in which Rod Laver claimed his first Grand Slam. “I think he was the greatest player,” Konchalski said. “He hit with topspin, was left-handed. His left forearm was one and a half times the size of his right forearm.” While Konchalski knew how to keep still in the background at tennis matches, by then he was far more active in basketball circles. He hopped from schoolyard to schoolyard, monitoring the rise of the city’s top basketball talents on municipal asphalt, but still returned to the West Side Tennis Club for the national tournament at the end of each summer. He described a shingle behind the marquee that had a couplet from Rudyard Kipling’s “If” scrawled across it. If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same Image The center court of the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, in 1977.CreditIra Schwarz/Associated Press Ashe, Konchalski thought, personified the poet’s ideals. Fresh off graduating from Fordham University, where he studied philosophy and political science, Konchalski took his measure of the man up close in 1968, at the first Open championship. “Arthur Ashe had a thunderous serve,” he said. “He was very thin, which belied his physique because you wouldn’t have thought he could generate as much power. He didn’t have great groundstrokes; he was a good volleyer at the net. The thing that stood out more than anything else about him was how he carried himself.” Konchalski worked a semifinal at that first Open, but he had a prior commitment for the final when it was pushed back a day, to Monday. It was his first day of school as a teacher at St. Kevin in Flushing. He made it to the stadium in time as a spectator, though, and for another decade kept his eyes trained on grass, hardcourt and Har-Tru surfaces, looking for chalk kicked up by balls flying at 100 miles an hour. His final assignment at West Side Tennis Club was a doubles match that featured the team of John McEnroe and Wojciech Fibak at the Forest Hills Invitational in July 1978. At one point, there was a quick exchange at the net, and McEnroe struck a forehand volley. It was on Har-Tru. Konchalski was on Line 9, the far sideline on the north end. He called the ball out. McEnroe complained to the chair umpire. Image Murals of Billie Jean King and Arthur Ashe near the Long Island Rail Road stop at 71st Avenue in Queens.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times “It happened so quickly that I didn’t know where the mark was,” Konchalski said. “And he pointed to a mark, which I didn’t think was where he hit it. But that would have made it good, and I changed my call. I didn’t want to argue.” After the match, Konchalski said, a lineswoman who was opposite him, told him: “You were right the first time. He pointed to the wrong one.” Konchalski never worked another match. “But that’s not what drove me out,” he said. In those days, his summer employment at Five Star Basketball Camp led him to pivot to full-time scouting. And as his uncle remained entrenched in tennis — in 1998, he received the International Tennis Hall of Fame’s Samuel Hardy Award for a lifetime of volunteer service — Konchalski continued to be a regular at the Open each summer. “Flushing Meadows is so much more egalitarian,” he said. Image John McEnroe in 1978. Konchalski said he once overruled himself on a call when McEnroe protested, but later regretted it.CreditReed Saxon/Associated Press In Forest Hills, Konchalski encounters reminders of his former life daily. Four murals are painted on a wall by the Long Island Rail Road stop at 71st Avenue. Konchalski admires the ones depicting Billie Jean King, Althea Gibson and Ashe. One figure is faded, but the name, in script, is recognizable to a trained eye. It is McEnroe. On a recent walk around the block, he found an open back gate to the West Side Tennis Club. Proceeding inside, he found a court set up, net and all, and pointed to seats with backs on them. There were wooden bleachers in the old says, he said, “a lot of splinters.” Plenty stays with him. He remembered the noise that he could hear from his post on the grandstand court when the building he lives in was being constructed. He pointed to his apartment all the way to the left. “I never use the terrace,” he said. Historic events were emblazoned on banners by the fence: an appearance by the Beatles, a performance by the Rolling Stones and the 1968 U.S. Open. Konchalski’s eyes widened. It said Laver claimed the title in 1968. “It’s the wrong year!” he said. “It was ’69! They have the wrong year up. That is wrong. Laver beat Tony Roche in four sets!” Rain started to fall. Konchalski ambled out as it came down harder. Caught without an umbrella, he quickened his pace before stopping under an awning. “That’s why they need a roof,” he said.

sport McVay 'sick' over offensive failings as Rams coach takes blame for loss Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? McVay 'sick' over offensive failings as Rams coach takes blame for loss OmnisportDecember 10, 2018, 12:02 PM GMT McVay 'sick' over offensive failings as Rams coach takes blame for lossAfter the Los Angeles Rams suffered only their second loss in 13 games, head coach Sean McVay took full responsibility. Sean McVay said he felt "sick" about the Los Angeles Rams' inability to take advantage of a strong defensive performance in a loss to the Chicago Bears that he blamed on himself. The Rams slumped to only their second defeat of another excellent campaign for McVay, who secured a playoff spot in his first season in charge and has steered them to a second successive NFC West title this year, with a 15-6 loss at Soldier Field. McVay's men have scored 425 points this season, the Rams coach seen as one of the masterminds of an offensive explosion in the NFL in recent years. Scroll to continue with content Ad However, they were held without a touchdown in Chicago, despite their defense forcing three turnovers from the Bears. And McVay took full responsibility for their failure to find the endzone, telling a media conference: "We didn't do enough to win and it starts with me, I continually put our football team in bad spots. I thought our defense played well enough, made enough turnovers and we didn't capitalise on them.  "Consistently over and over I put our players in bad spots. Certainly a humbling night but it's one where you get a chance to look at yourself critically, find a way to get better, move forward accordingly and that's exactly what we're going to do. "That's all I know how to do. I've got to be better for our football team. "This loss is on me, I didn't do nearly a good enough job for us and I trust that we'll respond the right way. "I'll make sure that I learn from a lot of the bad decisions that I did make for us. Whatever I was deciding on clearly wasn't putting our players in good spots and I can't wait to just go back, look at the tape, learn from it and move forward. Story continues "I feel sick about it because our job, from an offensive standpoint specifically in my role as a play-caller, is to help the team move the football and score points and I felt like our defense played a good enough game, got enough takeaways, where they played winning football.  "We are a team, we're going to stay connected, we're going to stay together but specific to my role with the offense I certainly feel very responsible."

sport Long Before Alabama, the South Had Sewanee - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Long Before Alabama, the South Had Sewanee Supported by Long Before Alabama, the South Had Sewanee The template for Nick Saban’s dominating Crimson Tide teams is easy to see — if you look back nearly 120 years. Image The 1899 Sewanee Tigers football team included Wild Bill Claiborne, top row, second from left; and Luke Lea, the equivalent of today's athletic director, top row, in hat.CreditCreditUniversity Archives and Special Collections: The University of the South By Ray Glier Jan. 4, 2019 Long before Alabama — and now Clemson — rose as proud football powers, the 1899 University of the South football team, familiarly known as the Sewanee Tigers, provided a blueprint for Southern college football domination. Alabama and Clemson would surely crush the Tigers, but the copyright for how to dominate an era of college football would probably belong to Sewanee, not Alabama or its opponent in Monday night’s national championship game, Clemson. The idealization of the football player in the South? The idea of tying a Southern university’s identity to football? They go back at least as far as Sewanee. The pursuit of money to keep a college football program greased for greatness? That is another trademark at least 119 years old. The Crimson Tide can capture their sixth national title in 10 years with a win over Clemson on Monday in Santa Clara, Calif. Clemson beat Alabama two years ago, and this is the third time the two teams have met for the championship in four years. But Sewanee, Tenn., a small town on the Cumberland Plateau, created the template for the flush, modern, Southern football powerhouse, and it has been used time and again in the past 60 years, reaching its apotheosis at Alabama under Coach Nick Saban. Sewanee was led by one of the first forward thinkers of Southern football, Luke Lea (pronounced LEE), its 22-year-old team manager. The equivalent of an athletic director today, Lea put together a five-game, six-day, 2,300-mile trip by train through the South because he needed money to finance the 1899 team, and barnstorming was the only way to get it. While most college teams were playing four or five games a season, Sewanee played 12. Lea scheduled moneymaking games against the University of Texas and Texas A&M at the front end of the trip and games with Tulane, Louisiana State and the University of Mississippi on the back end. “Luke Lea’s canniness and caginess is what made that program possible,” said Woody Register, a history professor at the University of the South who has researched the 1899 team. “It connects him to generations of program designers.” Lea, who became a United States senator at age 32, is considered the first to come up with the idea of having trainers on road trips to take care of the players and massage their weary legs back into playing shape. He created a team that was a merciless bully: The Tigers were 12-0 and outscored opponents, 322-10. Image Harrison Whitaker tackled Henry Soaper coming around the end at Hardee Field in 1895.CreditUniversity Archives and Special Collections: The University of the South Sewanee could not pass the football, as per the rules of the day, and it would be no match for Alabama or Clemson. The team was also entirely white. The first African-American student to graduate from Sewanee, Nathaniel Owens, entered in 1966 and graduated in 1970. He was an outstanding football player. Nonetheless, Norman Jetmundsen Jr., a Birmingham lawyer who is putting together a documentary on the Sewanee team, is certain today’s elite teams would be impressed with the Tigers. “They played 35 consecutive minutes a half on both sides of the ball with no substitution, and they played with serious injuries,” Jetmundsen said. “They played five games in six days on that train trip and won them all by shutout. Who wouldn’t be impressed by that?” In a chapter of a book on the history of Sewanee, Register wrote that the 1899 team “formed part of the university’s heritage.” The professor said that Benjamin Lawton Wiggins, the university’s vice chancellor at the time, in particular, rallied students around the notion that football should be a part of the Southern male’s identity. At the time, the South was desperate for cheer, and Sewanee’s success was seen as a response to the aristocratic Northerners of the day, who thought they owned the game. Football was something Southerners could excel at, especially in the aftermath of defeat in the Civil War and economic depression, said George Rable, an American historian. “The 1890s were a rough time for the nation economically, but especially for the South,” Rable said. “Football provided some comfort and sense of achievement.” The Tigers lived by the notion that football players required a roughneck quality and a deep resolve. Jetmundsen said halfback Henry Seibels, who was known as Diddy, suffered a gash on his head in the game with Texas, but continued playing when the wound was covered with quick-setting plaster. Lineman Wild Bill Claiborne played with an eye patch, ostensibly to protect an injury. He would look across at his opponent, gesture to the patch, and declare: “This is what happened in the last game. Let’s see what happens today.” Image From left, lineman Wild Bill Claiborne, who played with an eyepatch, and Richard Bolling.CreditUniversity Archives and Special Collections: The University of the South Fullback Ormond Simkins wore heavy knee braces as he battered into the line. His legs were eventually amputated below the knee because of football injuries. When the Southeastern Conference was created in 1932, Sewanee was a charter member, even though its days of being a powerhouse were long over. Inclusion was a tribute to the 1899 Tigers, a team for which Alabama’s Saban is a worthy descendant. Saban was the first coach in the SEC to consistently adopt a season-opening game in a neutral, big city for money and exposure when Alabama played Clemson in Atlanta in 2008. Now, marquee matchups at the start of the season are a regular occurrence across college football. Saban is also the primary fund-raiser for football facilities on campus, which are among the best nationally. He knows what Lea did — success requires money. “There is a connection between then and now because there is a significant money element at the center of the sport, and money is an unavoidable element of the game of college football,” Register said. “To have a mighty program, and be the champions of the South, which was their real aspiration, that required money.” Saban has been a catalyst for football programs, Clemson among them, to add layers and layers of support staff, more than a century after Sewanee added trainers. And the Crimson Tide (13-0) are as merciless as they come. They outscored opponents by 33.1 points a game this season, the biggest margin in the country. Clemson was second at 30.6. Alabama and college football, in general, have become symbols of pride in the New South. As in 1899, Rable said, “there is still a sectional quality to the football” that has its roots in the sentiments created by the Civil War. If a team from the Southeastern Conference is throttling a team from another conference, he added, “you can hear chants of ‘SEC, SEC, SEC.’” The ghosts of the Sewanee Tigers, nicknamed the Ironmen, would surely approve.

sport Bears dial up wild play to get offensive tackle a TD catch Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Matt Nagy has no fear, dials up a TD pass to an offensive lineman on third-and-goal Frank SchwabYahoo SportsDecember 10, 2018, 3:34 AM GMT Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy showed against the New York Giants, when he had running back Tarik Cohen throw a pass on the final play of regulation for a touchdown, that he’ll call any play at any time. Expect anything with Nagy. On third-and-goal, in a huge nationally televised game against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night, Nagy went to the final few pages of the playbook again. Scroll to continue with content Ad Nagy put multiple defensive players in the game, with defensive end Akiem Hicks in the backfield alongside quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who was in shotgun. Hicks scored on a touchdown run against the Giants. Two defensive linemen were just behind the offensive line ready to block. The best part of the play was what happened first. Trubisky ran a read option with Hicks. Hicks is 332 pounds. Even better, Hicks entirely sold the run fake to the middle of the line. With all of the action right in the middle of the line, nobody noticed 312-pound offensive tackle Bradley Sowell peeling off into the end zone. Trubisky threw a high pass to Sowell, who made a very nice catch for the touchdown. Then Sowell had a touchdown celebration dance that should have made everyone laugh. When you’re a 312-pound tackle who scores a touchdown, you don’t hold back on the dance. That gave the Bears a 15-6 lead. The Bears are fun to watch. Nagy, the rookie head coach, runs his team like we all do when we have the controller in “Madden.” He definitely doesn’t have much fear. Chicago Bears head coach Matt Nagy dialed up a crazy play to get an offensive lineman a touchdown catch. (AP) – – – – – – – Frank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

sport Cowboys Send Giants to Another Late Loss - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Cowboys Send Giants to Another Late Loss Supported by Cowboys Send Giants to Another Late Loss Image Cole Beasley hauled in the winning touchdown reception for the Cowboys late in the fourth quarter.CreditCreditBen Solomon for The New York Times By The Associated Press Dec. 30, 2018 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Don’t tell Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys that their regular-season finale against the Giants was a meaningless game. They played it to the end and got momentum for the playoffs. Prescott threw a 32-yard fourth-down touchdown pass to Cole Beasley on a play that was reversed by video replay and added a winning 2-point conversion pass to Michael Gallup with 1 minute 12 seconds to play as the Cowboys, the N.F.C. East champions, rallied twice in the final 10 minutes to beat the Giants, 36-35, on Sunday. “You saw it out there the intensity that we played with, the ups and the downs and how we stayed through it,” Prescott said after going 27 of 44 for 387 yards and a season-high four touchdowns, three to tight end Blake Jarwin. “We stayed positive, knowing we were going to give ourselves a chance to come out on the end. It was a great win.” The win was the seventh in eight games for the Cowboys, and it had them looking forward to next weekend’s wild-card game at home. Dallas Coach Jason Garrett played down the idea that the game had been meaningless, even though he rested Ezekiel Elliott, the N.F.L.’s leading rusher, and two of his top offensive linemen. “That might be for people outside our building, talking about the meaningful or meaningless nature of a game,” Garrett said. “They’re all very meaningful to us. It’s opportunity for us to improve as a football team, to finish strong, to have some momentum going into the playoffs.” For the Giants (5-11), it was another late loss. They lost eight games by 7 points or fewer in Pat Shurmur’s first season, the last two by a total of 2 points. This also could have been quarterback Eli Manning’s final start for them after a 15-year career. He has a year left on a four-year contract, but his salary will count against the cap for $23 million next season. Manning, who is soon to be 38 and is not very mobile, still loves to play, but the Giants have made the playoffs only once since winning the Super Bowl in February 2012. “The losses hurt, and they are tough to deal with,” said Manning, who went 24 of 41 for 301 yards with two touchdowns. “They are tougher now than in the past because you know your opportunities are running low to make playoffs and championship runs. When you are not doing as well as you want to, it is tough to handle.” Saquon Barkley capped a record-setting rookie season with a sensational 2-yard touchdown dive with 3:21 to play to put the Giants ahead, 35-28. However, Prescott engineered a nine-play, 70-yard drive that he ended with an arching pass to Beasley in the back of the end zone. There was no doubt he had caught the ball, and a review showed he had gotten his knee down in bounds. Speaking of Prescott, Garrett said, “That was as good a play as I’ve ever seen him make, and Beas made a big-time catch at the end of it.” Garrett added that it made no sense to go to overtime with a playoff game next week. Barkley finished with 109 yards rushing and 142 yards from scrimmage. He ended the season with 91 catches, breaking Reggie Bush’s N.F.L. record (88) for most receptions by a rookie running back. Barkley, the No. 2 overall pick, also finished with 2,028 yards from scrimmage, joining the Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson (2,212 yards in 1983) and Edgerrin James (2,139 in 1999) as the only rookies with at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in N.F.L. history. Prescott hit Jarwin on scoring passes of 13, 19 and 39 yards. His 49-yard pass set up Rod Smith’s 1-yard touchdown run. Manning had touchdown passes of 21 yards to Cody Latimer and 6 to Evan Engram, who also caught a pass for a 2-point conversion. Wayne Gallman added a 2-yard touchdown run, and Aldrick Rosas kicked two field goals. Injuries COWBOYS Guard Xavier Su’-a-Filo started with Zack Martin out and was hurt in the third quarter. Wide receiver Tavon Austin, who has been sidelined since Week 6 with a groin injury, returned to action. Linebacker Leighton Vander Esch left the field with a lower-leg injury. He said it was minor. GIANTS Grant Haley, a backup cornerback, left in the first half with a concussion. Wide receiver-returner Corey Coleman sustained a foot injury in the second half. Rushing Title While Resting Elliott won the N.F.L. rushing title with 1,434 yards. Barkley finished second with 1,307, and Todd Gurley, who like Elliott did not play on Sunday, dropped to third with 1,251 yards. Barkley’s 142 yards from scrimmage allowed him to lead the league. Elliott finished second with 2,001, and Christian McCaffrey of the Panthers was third with 1,965. Extra Points Blake Jarwin’s touchdown catches were his first three in the N.F.L. … Giants linebacker Olivier Vernon had two and a half sacks and six quarterback hits. … Dallas cornerback Chidobe Awuzie had an end zone interception on the Giants’ opening drive. Dallas’s DeMarcus Lawrence had a strip sack that his fellow lineman Antwaun Woods recovered. … Giants linebacker B. J. Goodson recovered Amari Cooper’s fumble, which had been caused by defensive lineman Kerry Wynn.

CreditCreditBrigham Young University By Richard Goldstein Dec. 21, 2018 Mel Hutchins, the All-American center who helped elevate Brigham Young University to the top ranks of college basketball in 1951 and became an N.B.A. All-Star and a senior member of a remarkable sports family, died on Wednesday in Encinitas, Calif. He was 90. His son, Matthew, who confirmed the death, said he had been treated for Alzheimer’s disease. At 6 feet 5 inches, Hutchins was hardly a big man, but he was an outstanding rebounder, both at Brigham Young and as a professional. He also gained acclaim for his defensive skills, and he had a nifty jump shot when that was first becoming an offensive weapon. Hutchins joined with the six-foot forward Roland Minson in taking Brigham Young to the championship of the 1951 National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden, at a time when it rivaled the N.C.A.A. championship tournament in prestige. A few days later, the Cougars reached the second round of the West regionals in the N.C.A.A. tournament before they were eliminated. The N.I.T. crown was the first national championship in any sport for Brigham Young, which is best known for its affiliation with the Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Hutchins was selected by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the No. 2 overall pick in the 1951 N.B.A. draft, shortly before they became the Milwaukee Hawks. He shared rookie of the year honors for the 1951-52 season with Bill Tosheff of the Indianapolis Olympians, and was the co-leader in rebounds (13.3 per game) with the 6-foot-9 Larry Foust of the Fort Wayne Pistons. Hutchins was obtained by the Pistons after two seasons in Milwaukee and was a key figure in their reaching the finals of the N.B.A. playoffs in 1955 and 1956. Image Hutchins in 1957. He played in four All-Star Games during his seven years in the N.B.A. Hutchins’s sister, Colleen Kay Hutchins, who was Miss America of 1952 and also a Brigham Young graduate, married the Knicks guard Ernie Vandeweghe in 1953, when he was combining pro basketball with the beginning of his career as physician. They had two sons and two daughters, all of them elite athletes. Mel Hutchins was the uncle of Kiki Vandeweghe, the high-scoring N.B.A. forward and later general manager and coach of the Nets; Bruk (pronounced Brook) Vandeweghe, who won a bronze medal in beach volleyball at the 1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia; Heather Vandeweghe, a captain of the national women’s water polo team; and Tauna Vandeweghe, who competed in the women’s 100-meter backstroke at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Hutchins was also the great-uncle of Tauna’s daughter CoCo, a prominent tennis pro. Melvin Ray Hutchins was born on Nov. 22, 1928, in Sacramento and grew up in Arcadia, Calif., outside Los Angeles. He was an outstanding high school football and basketball player but competed only in basketball at B.Y.U. Hutchins’s Cougars defeated Dayton, 62-43, for the 1951 N.I.T. championship behind his strong defensive effort against the Flyers’ high-scoring center, Don Meineke. Minson was the offensive star with 26 points. Hutchins averaged 12.7 rebounds in his senior season, a preview of his pro career, during which he was a dominant figure on the boards with his spring, his long arms and his sense of timing. He played in four All-Star Games during his seven years in the N.B.A. George Yardley, one of the league’s finest jump shooters of the 1950s and Hutchins’s teammate with the Pistons, marveled at his play on both ends of the court. “I could move my body well to either side while in the air and still control my shot,” Yardley was quoted by Charles Salzberg in the oral history “From Set Shot to Slam Dunk” (1987). “Mel Hutchins could do it, too, but we were oddities at the time.” Image Playing for the Fort Wayne Pistons, Mel Hutchins (9) battled for a rebound with Earl Lloyd (11) of the Syracuse Nationals in Indianapolis in 1955. Hutchins led the Pistons to the N.B.A. playoff finals that year.CreditAssociated Press “As an individual defensive player Hutchins was the best,” Yardley said. “If you could score on Hutchins you could score on anybody.” Johnny Payak, a guard who played with Hutchins on the Hawks, told how he had often stymied George Mikan, the 6-foot-10 center for the Minneapolis Lakers who became the N.B.A.’s first superstar. “Mel Hutchins used to drive Mikan nuts,” Payak recalled to Neil D. Isaacs for his oral history “Vintage NBA” (1996). “He would watch Mikan, would wait, and time his jump. Mikan didn’t have that good of a hook shot. He would kind of turn and shoot but not high in the air. Mel would time it and just knock the ball away.” Hutchins’s playing days ended after a knee injury limited him to 18 games with the Knicks in the 1957-58 season. He averaged 11.1 points and 9.6 rebounds for his two seasons with Milwaukee, four with Fort Wayne and a final season with the Knicks. He later worked in real estate. In addition to his son, Hutchins’s immediate survivors include his daughters Laura Green, Dana Dalton, Melanie Holmes and Shauna Hutchins; 14 grandchildren; and 24 great-grandchildren. His wife, Lorene (Hardy) Hutchins, died in 2011. Colleen Hutchins Vandeweghe died in 2010, and Ernie Vandeweghe died in 2014. Hutchins and Wilt Chamberlain are the only N.B.A. players to have led the league in rebounding in their rookie seasons. Hutchins, at 6 feet 5, was also among the smallest (or least tall) players to be a single-season leader in rebounds. Harry Gallatin (with the Knicks in 1954) and Charles Barkley (with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1987) also led the N.B.A. in rebounding, and all three are listed by basketball-reference.com as 6 feet 6 inches, although the N.B.A. website states that Barkley was “probably actually closer to 6-4,” which would make him the shortest rebounding champion. In the late spring of 1987, Hutchins received an unexpected phone call. “The caller identified himself as Charles,” Hutchins recalled in “Forgotten Champions” (2011), a remembrance of Brigham Young’s 1951 N.I.T. victors by Rocky Steele. “I told him that I knew a Charles that lived in Sacramento, but it didn’t sound like him. He sounded a little frustrated, and said, ‘This is Sir Charles.’ I told him I’d never heard of that. He raised his voice and said, ‘This is Sir Charles Barkley, and I just broke your record.’ ” Correction:  An earlier version of this obituary misspelled, at one point, the surname of a teammate of Hutchins’s on the Brigham Young University basketball team. He is Roland Minson, not Minton. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Mel Hutchins, B.Y.U. All-American And N.B.A. All-Star, Is Dead at 90.

Seeking its fifth title and its first since 2017, the United States will face the winner of the Finland-Switzerland game, which took place later Friday night, in the championship game on Saturday night. “I was just trying to stay calm and composed,” said Primeau, a freshman at Northeastern. “I knew they were going to try and get some shots off at the end. I was just trying to stay big. Then you can celebrate after the buzzer has gone.” Wahlstrom opened the scoring with 5 minutes 31 seconds left in the first period. Forward Logan Cockerill powered down the ice, faked a shot and sliced to Wahlstrom. The United States made it 2-0 on a power play at 4:20 of the second after Vitali Kravtsov was called for tripping. Jack Hughes got a pass off to Chmelevski directly in front of the net, and Chmelevski poked it under goaltender Pyotr Kochetkov.

According to an earlier statement from Cal, the medical emergency occurred near Turner’s Southern California home during winter break. Cal had previously ended its season with the Cheez-It Bowl on Dec. 26. Per 247Sports, Turner collapsed during a non-strenuous workout and later fell into a coma. “We are so deeply saddened by Bryce’s passing,” Cal coach Justin Wilcox said in a statement. “This is an extremely difficult day for everyone. Our heartfelt sympathies go out to Bryce’s family, friends, teammates and so many others who have been a part of his life. No words can accurately describe the pain we feel in our hearts right now.

sport Lakers need leadership in lieu of LeBron and Rondo – Walton Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Lakers need leadership in lieu of LeBron and Rondo – Walton OmnisportJanuary 5, 2019, 10:04 AM GMT Lakers need leadership in lieu of LeBron and Rondo – WaltonLuke Walton acknowledged his young Los Angeles Lakers side has a tendency to fall apart without LeBron James and Rajon Rondo. With veteran duo LeBron James and Rajon Rondo out injured, Luke Walton has urged other Los Angeles Lakers players to fill the leadership void. The Lakers went down 119-112 to the New York Knicks at Staples Center on Friday, their fourth loss in five matches since James sustained a groin strain against the Golden State Warriors. James will miss the Lakers' next two games and be reassessed next week, while Rondo is not expected to be back until February after having surgery on his finger. Scroll to continue with content Ad After seeing his team surrender a six-point advantage in the fourth quarter against the Knicks, Walton wants to see greater maturity from his young core. "It's got to come from the group. We know we have some of the best leaders in the game. We've got LeBron, Rondo and Tyson [Chandler], but they're hurt so it's up to other people to step up and lead," said Walton. "Guys are doing it, we just have to do more of it. It's great when things are going well. The challenge is when we hit dry spells or other teams get hot, that's when it starts getting quiet. "That's when we need it the most. That's when we need five guys huddling up on the court talking about what happened on the last play, what's going to happen on the next play. Being in the moment of playing. "That's something that normally comes with age. We're playing a lot of young guys right now, but that's where we're at and we trust and we believe that the guys playing can win. We just have to do it." Walton felt the Lakers broke away from a team ethic as they came under pressure in the fourth quarter, with too many individuals attempting solo plays. "Until we accept that the team is the most important thing – and I can't tell if it's because we're missing open shots and layups if you will that we stop trusting each other," he said. Story continues "But the ball was moving beautifully when we built up our lead then we got to the fourth and we had a couple possessions of nice ball movement and then when shots didn't go in, guys start trying to do it on their own and that's not a recipe for us to win. "For what we're playing with and the amount of injuries we have to guys who are a huge part of what we do, we've got to play for one another, the guys that are out there on the court. It cost us again in the fourth quarter. A little frustrating, but no one's feeling sorry for us." JaVale McGee was one of the Lakers' other veterans on the court and the towering centre acknowledged leadership responsibilities must be picked up elsewhere with big names out of commission. "We've got to step up. Everybody, as a team. We've got to step up, there's no excuse. We are professionals, we know how to play basketball, so we just got to come together and step up," said McGee.

sport Alabama and Clemson Are Undefeated. But Which One Will Win? - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Alabama and Clemson Are Undefeated. But Which One Will Win? Supported by Keeping Score Alabama and Clemson Are Undefeated. But Which One Will Win? Image Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa celebrated Alabama’s 45-34 victory over Oklahoma in the national semifinals. The Crimson Tide will meet Clemson, which is also 14-0, on Monday night in the title game.CreditCreditWilfredo Lee/Associated Press By Victor Mather Jan. 4, 2019 The college football national championship game on Monday night matches two undefeated teams, Alabama and Clemson, both 14-0. It may seem hard to separate two teams that have swept all before them. But there are ways, and in the end, they point to one clear favorite in the game. Whom Did They Beat? Alabama and Clemson turned aside quite a few solid teams. Clemson had a slight edge, meeting 10 bowl teams to Alabama’s nine. But it isn’t difficult to make a bowl game these days. Using more exclusive criteria, Alabama clearly played a tougher schedule. It faced six teams in the final College Football Playoff top 25; Clemson faced three. Computer evaluations of schedules agree: Jeff Sagarin’s, for example, ranks Alabama’s schedule as the 28th toughest in the country and Clemson’s 45th. How Badly Did They Beat Them? Both teams dealt out some whippings this season: Clemson won games by 61 and 60 points, Alabama by 55 and 50. Their average margins of victory were quite close, both about 31.5 points per game. But whether a team wins by 50 or 60 proves less about its inherent quality and more about its style of play, its use of substitutes and its thirst for the jugular. The closer games are more revealing. Each team had two games that it won by fewer than 20 points. Alabama beat Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game by 7. It beat Oklahoma in the national semifinals by 11. Both of those teams are in the top five in the College Football Playoff rankings. Clemson’s close games were less impressive. It beat Texas A&M by 2 and Syracuse, at home, by 4. Those teams are ranked 19th and 20th in the playoff rankings. Did They Have Common Opponents? Yes, two. Both teams hammered Louisville — Clemson by 61 at home and Alabama by 37 at a neutral site. But their more challenging common matchup was Texas A&M. With the caveat that Alabama was at home and Clemson was on the road, the wins were drastically different: Alabama won by 22 and Clemson by 2. Offense and Defense Does a deeper plunge into statistics turn up some good signs for Clemson? Alabama was significantly more successful in the passing game. It averaged 11.3 yards per pass and gave up only 5.9. Clemson’s figures were 8.1 and 6.3. The gap in their differentials is huge: +5.4 for Alabama and +1.8 for Clemson. Image Travis Etienne rushed for more than 1,500 yards this season for Clemson, which beat Notre Dame in the semifinals, 30-3.CreditTim Warner/Getty Images Clemson will have to make up this deficit with the running game: The Tigers outperformed Alabama offensively on the ground, 6.8 yards per carry to 5.3, and defensively, 2.4 to 3.4. Travis Etienne had more than 1,500 yards rushing for Clemson. Rushing is still a big part of the college game, but its influence wanes a little more every year, especially in closer games. Clemson will not want to fall behind Alabama and have to turn to the pass. On the other hand, one of Clemson’s biggest rushing efforts came in its close game against Syracuse: Etienne had a career-best 203 yards. What Happened in Their Semifinal Games? At first glance, Clemson might have seemed to have the better semifinal, beating No. 3 Notre Dame by 27, while Alabama topped No. 4 Oklahoma by 11. In fact, despite the rankings, Oklahoma was a more formidable opponent than Notre Dame. Looking at the Irish’s undefeated season under the same microscope we are applying to Alabama and Clemson does not yield an impressive picture. Notre Dame played three top-25 teams and only one in the top 10. It had six games decided by 10 or fewer points, including home games against Vanderbilt and (oof) Ball State. (Central Florida, unbeaten until the Fiesta Bowl, also comes up short by these metrics: no top-25 teams on the schedule and a mere 1-point win over Memphis.) How Do Their Conferences Stack Up? Few would argue that the SEC is not the best conference in the country. Sagarin rates the SEC West, which includes Alabama, first and the SEC East second. The divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference rank seventh and eighth, behind both divisions of the Big Ten, the Big 12 and the Pac-12 North. The second-best team in the A.C.C., Syracuse, is ranked 28th by Sagarin. That’s behind nine SEC teams. What Does It All Add Up To? There are plenty of people making computer rankings for college football, using a slew of methodologies. Kenneth Massey tracks 110 of them, and their choice is clear: Alabama is favored in 82 of them, and Clemson in 27. (One, mysteriously, goes for Notre Dame.) And the bookmakers agree. Alabama is favored by 5 to 6 points. Two perfect teams. But one is just a little more perfect.

sport In Buenos Aires, a Final Is Gone, and So Is Some of Its Fire - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|In Buenos Aires, a Final Is Gone, and So Is Some of Its Fire Supported by In Buenos Aires, a Final Is Gone, and So Is Some of Its Fire Image River Plate players and coaches during a training session on Thursday in Madrid.CreditCreditAndrea Comas/Associated Press By Daniel Politi Dec. 8, 2018 BUENOS AIRES — When Zaira Mauas, a lifelong fan of the soccer club River Plate, stepped inside the Monumental stadium two weeks ago, she could barely contain her excitement. “I was going crazy — I had a level of anxiety and nerves that is difficult to explain,” said Mauas, a 35-year-old travel agent who was among the tens of thousands of River fans who had been fortunate to obtain a ticket for the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final against archrival Boca Juniors. “I was so happy and had an incredible amount of adrenaline.” The day didn’t go as planned. Boca’s bus was attacked by River fans, its players were treated for injuries from broken glass and drifting pepper spray, and the game’s kickoff was delayed several times. Mauas wound up seeking medical assistance after sitting for hours in the sun waiting for the match to start. It never did. After the game was postponed for a second time the next day, South American soccer authorities decided the long-anticipated final between these two Buenos Aires teams would not be played in Argentina at all. Instead, they announced that it would be moved to Spain. Last month, the prospect that the final of Copa Libertadores, the most important club tournament in the Americas, would be decided by Boca Juniors and River Plate, Argentina’s most heated rivalry, had turned Buenos Aires upside down. Now, with the final set for Sunday in a stadium 6,000 miles from here, there seems to be far less enthusiasm for the match. For Mauas, whose anticipation for the showdown was so all-consuming that she and her sister agreed to get matching River tattoos when it was all over, the emotional appeal is gone. Image A Boca Juniors fan at the Buenos Aires airport on Thursday. The relocation of the Copa Libertadores final to Madrid has angered many fans.CreditMarcos Brindicci/Reuters Her sister is now having doubts about that tattoo, Mauas said, and earlier this week she joined hundreds of fans at the Monumental to protest the decision to play the game in Madrid. “It’s super unfair that they take away the possibility of living this in our stadium,” she said. “Boca had its chance” — the first leg ended in a 2-2 tie at Boca’s La Bombonera stadium — “and we have the same right.” “You can’t play a final of the Libertadores Cup in Spain,” she added. “It’s crazy.” Mauas said she would still watch the match, of course, but said she did not feel “even 10 percent as excited” as she was two weeks ago. And she is hardly alone. Matías Sonzini Astudillo, 24, said he could barely stop thinking about the final in the weeks before the first leg. “Two weeks ago I kept thinking that I didn’t know what I would do with myself if we lost,” said Astudillo, a River Plate supporter. “Now, whether we win or lose really doesn’t change anything for me.” Agustín Nacarato, a 35-year-old lawyer, canceled all his plans two weekends ago so he could be in front of the television and follow every single moment of the match that had been hyped as “La Final de Todos los Tiempos:” the final for all time. Image River Plate fans protested the relocation of the final last week outside the team’s stadium.CreditJavier Gonzalez Toledo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Now, he is not sure he will tune in. “I wouldn’t feel like I’m really missing much,” Nacarato said, explaining that he has plans with friends for Sunday and will only change them if it is by consensus. “This was once a match that was undoubtedly a final. Now it doesn’t feel that way.” Sam Kelly, the host of Hand of Pod, a podcast about Argentine soccer, said neither team would be able to declare a clear victory now. “It’s stained,” he said, “Whoever wins now will have the biggest asterisk in history next to their name.” In fact, fans from both sides have taken to quoting the Boca Juniors legend Juan Román Riquelme, who recently characterized the match that will be played in Spain as “the most expensive friendly in history.” The fact that Conmebol, the regional soccer body that runs the Copa Libertadores, chose Madrid of all places to play the final of a tournament whose name literally translates to the Liberators of the Americas Cup — named in homage to those who fought for independence from colonial rule — is seen as particularly galling. “There is just something strange and symbolic that the Copa Libertadores de America is going to the place that colonized America,” said Facundo Ureta, a 35-year-old lawyer. That disdain for the arrangement extends even to the game’s new site. “There’s a strong emotional component because it isn’t just in Spain but also in Real Madrid’s stadium, the team that is most closely tied to Spanish royalty,” said Miguel Goyeneche, a 23-year-old Boca Juniors fan. “It’s almost too funny to be true.” Image Boca Juniors fans swarmed the bus carrying their team on Tuesday. The team will face its arch rival, River Plate, in Madrid on Sunday.CreditGetty Images The change of venue and all the back and forth between the soccer authorities “delegitimized the final and a lot of the anticipation we experienced before has now disappeared,” said Fernando Olomudzecki, 28, who works as a guide for an agency that takes tourists to Argentine stadiums and soccer matches. The main reason tourists are fascinated by Argentine soccer, Olomudzecki said, has to do with the passion with which Argentine fans live the sport. But that is oddly missing now, he said. “So much of the essence has been lost, we really want to play it and get it over and done with,” Olomudzecki said. For others, the game’s relocation has prompted soul-searching, and a chance to confront some of the elements — violence, corruption, greed — that have marred South American soccer. “As a fan, it’s very painful that a cup that is from the Americas has to be played in another continent,” the Boca Juniors fan Sebastián Bustamante said. “As a citizen, I feel like this is a punishment we deserve, because if it didn’t hurt us and we don’t see it as a call to attention, we’re never going to change.” But Bustamante also spoke to another truth: he made his comments from an airport boarding gate, where he was about to board a flight to Madrid to cheer on Boca. He, and others, said they could not look away now. “Surely it won’t be the same level of excitement, but we have to win the cup regardless,” said Martín Mathys, a 26-year-old accountant and Boca fan. “In 10 years, few will remember everything that happened, and the only thing that will matter is who won.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP5 of the New York edition with the headline: Argentine Fans Have an Empty Feeling.

Blood Samples Supported by The Mavericks’ Key to Keeping Players Fresh? Blood Samples Image The Mavericks’ Jose Juan Barea getting blood pulled from his ear by an Orreco research specialist.CreditCreditAllison V. Smith for The New York Times By Marc Stein Jan. 7, 2019 DALLAS — Whether they are trying to keep their 34-year-old playmaker Jose Juan Barea spry or aiming to help their 19-year-old phenom Luka Doncic dodge the infamous rookie wall, the Dallas Mavericks turn to the same resource: A blood test. It is not just any blood test. The Mavericks import frequent testing from the Irish company Orreco, which is in its third season making personalized recommendations for Mavericks players regarding athletic workloads and diets, largely through the study of blood analysis. Although some in the sports medicine community have questioned whether the value of such blood work is overstated, Dallas leans heavily on Orreco’s team of consultants and their assessments of how to maximize player-readiness. “All the things N.B.A. teams talk about — players’ minutes, their load, their tracking data, their camera data — all of that is external data used to try to predict what’s going on internally,” said Casey Smith, the head of Dallas’s athletic training staff. “What we’re doing is trying to get a little bit of a look at what’s actually going on internally.” Dallas is one of just two N.B.A. teams, along with the Knicks, to hire Orreco, which proposes customized remedies to combat fatigue and tries to identify increased risk for injury and illness by obtaining a range of data from players’ blood and feeding it into machine-learning programs. Taking cues from Orreco’s findings, Smith and Jeremy Holsopple, the Mavericks’ athletic performance director, tailor an individualized mix of training, rest and recovery for each of Dallas’s 17 players. The Mavericks' owner, Mark Cuban, said the team pays Orreco nearly $150,000 per year. No Maverick has embraced this process more than Barea, who understands all too well that fatigued players face an increased risk of soft-tissue injuries. Two seasons ago, amid worrisome forecasts from what Smith referred to as “the numbers,” Barea tore a calf muscle in a November 2016 game against Boston. Ever since, Barea has proactively sought updates on his levels of oxidative stress (worrisome as they get higher) and white blood cell counts (which can indicate illness or infection when they spike or indicate less immune prevention as they get lower). This season, Barea is playing some of his best basketball (averaging 10.9 points and 5.7 assists in just 19.8 minutes per game) and said he is “having more fun than ever” while carefully adhering to the suggestions Smith gives based off Orreco’s data. Image Barea is averaging 10.9 points and 5.7 assists in 19.8 minutes per game this season.CreditSue Ogrocki/Associated Press “I like it,” Barea said. “At this point in my career, you have to work more on the body. They let me know what’s going on — like what you need to eat or what you need to stop eating. I want the feedback.” Four times a season, Orreco staff members come to Dallas to administer a full venous blood draw on Mavericks players. To supplement those visits, Dallas mixes in frequent capillary blood draws for its players in which a quick pinprick sample is taken to provide near-instant readings of oxidative stress levels in the blood from a player’s ear or index finger. League rules allow players to refuse any blood testing if they find the procedures too invasive, but the team says only one Maverick, whom they declined to identify, had done so. “It’s your health, so it’s your decision,” Smith said. The samples, according to the Orreco co-founder Dr. Brian Moore, enable the firm to analyze a player’s hematology and biochemistry by assessing nearly 50 biomarkers. This includes examining creatine kinase to assess muscle damage and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein to measure inflammation — two areas of particular concern for basketball players because of the nature of their on-court movements. Hydration and nutrition indicators — such as vitamin D levels, and iron and fatty acid profiles — are among the additional variables analyzed to determine where each player lands on a four-zone “readiness to perform” index. Along with the biomarker panels, Orreco’s algorithms also take into account game minutes, air miles traveled, sleep data and reaction times that are obtained from wearable devices used during practices. The rules that allow players to opt out of blood testing are in place because regulating how teams use biometrics and the data such research produces — specifically whether the data belongs to the teams, players or the league itself — remains an evolving point of concern throughout the N.B.A. As a safeguard amid the rise of wearable technology in practice sessions, league policy threatens fines of up to $250,000 per team for the misuse of biometric data. Yet Smith insists that the collaboration with Orreco has improved the Mavericks’ ability to track the onset of illness and keep players “more available” for games. In the 2016-17 season, according to data maintained by InStreetClothes.com, a website that tracks injuries in the N.B.A., Dallas players missed only four games due to illness — less than half the league average of 8.5. The Mavericks then lost a league-low zero games to illness last season, when the league average was 7.1 games per team, according to the site. “Does that mean we win more games?” Smith said. “Not necessarily. But it gives us a better shot.” Still, with the sports and fitness world littered with treatments not supported by vetted published studies, some independent experts have their doubts. Dr. Anthony Romeo, the chief of orthopedics at the Rothman Institute in New York and a former team physician for the Chicago White Sox who also worked with the Chicago Bulls, said he would maintain “a healthy level of skepticism” about Orreco’s work until it reveals more about the biomarkers it studies and the data being gathered. Image Barea and Casey Smith, the Mavericks’ athletic director, accessed the player’s Orreco account before a recent practice.CreditAllison V. Smith for The New York Times ”I would be cautious and say it’s investigational,” Romeo said. “It’s a very interesting area of research and we applaud the efforts that they’re making. But at this time nothing supplants outstanding coaches and trainers that can do a visual analysis and understand their athletes from the traditional methods to know whether they’re training too hard or too little.” “At some point,” Romeo said of Orreco, “they’re going to have to share their data in a way that it can be repeated so that we know it’s true.” Said Dr. Robert Dimeff, a team physician for the Dallas Stars of the N.H.L. and a past president of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine: “I think this is a research-based tool at this point in time, but I don’t think it’s ready for prime time. What they’re doing is something that in 10 years from now we may say, ‘Wow, this is absolutely great information.’ “We can’t say that right now. But what they’re doing is trying to put some science behind recommendations and I think that’s very admirable.” Despite such skepticism, Cuban remains one of the biggest proponents of Orreco’s work. After watching an interview in which the openly data-hungry Cuban discussed his growing fascination with artificial intelligence, Moore wrote to Cuban before the 2016-17 season with a pitch that Orreco could “optimize performance, accelerate recovery and prolong careers” by using “high-end computing to find patterns in the data.” “Our job is to help the Mavericks make better decisions,” Moore said. Cuban was quickly sold. “Managing player load is as important as understanding traditional basketball analytics,’’ Cuban said. “Causation is always more valuable that correlation.” Although the Mavericks are hardly alone in embracing bioanalytics, they are on a very short list of top-level professional sports franchises that are willing to ignore the ultra-secretive norm and publicly acknowledge its work with Orreco. Aside from the Mavericks, only Newcastle United of the English Premier League has acknowledged being an Orreco customer. Through a person with knowledge of the contract, The Times confirmed that the Knicks are the other N.B.A. team to use Orreco as extensively as the Mavericks. Orreco also consults with a handful of individual players, including Wilson Chandler of the Philadelphia 76ers and Quincy Pondexter of the San Antonio Spurs. The company, though, said it could not discuss the Knicks, or the two Major League Baseball clubs and another Premier League soccer team it counts as clients. Smith cited Quest Diagnostics’ Blueprint Fit as another top practitioner in the field that he suspects has an N.B.A. clientele and acknowledged that several of his peers within the league are aware of what Dallas is doing, and asking lots of questions. “And I think there will be more,” Smith said.

sport Rick Pitino Takes Head Coaching Job in Greece - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Rick Pitino Takes Head Coaching Job in Greece Supported by Rick Pitino Takes Head Coaching Job in Greece Image Rick Pitino, shown coaching Louisville in 2017, is the only coach to win national titles at two schools. His title with Lousville was later vacated.CreditCreditTimothy D. Easley/Associated Press By Marc Tracy Dec. 20, 2018 Rick Pitino, the Hall of Fame basketball coach who was fired as Louisville’s head coach last year amid allegations that he was aware of illicit payments to a prospect that were revealed by federal prosecutors, has agreed to be the new head coach of one of Greece’s top teams. The team, Panathinaikos, is based in Athens. The agreement, first reported by ESPN, was confirmed by Drew Rosenhaus, Pitino’s agent. Pitino, 66, is known as one of the most accomplished college basketball coaches of his generation, widely regarded for his tactics and motivation. In the late 1980s, he revived the scandal-ridden Kentucky program, winning a national championship in 1996 and laying the groundwork for another two years later. Starting in 2001, he similarly rejuvenated Louisville’s program, winning the Cardinals’ third national title in 2013, though the N.C.A.A. subsequently vacated it because of recruiting violations. Earlier, in 1987, he took Providence to the Final Four. He remains the only coach to reach the Final Four with three different programs and the only one to win national titles at two, although the second was the vacated Louisville title. Stints in the N.B.A., with the Boston Celtics and the Knicks, were less successful. But he was brought low at Louisville by repeated scandals, including an extramarital affair with the future wife of a staff member and the scandal that led to vacated wins, in which a former staff member repeatedly paid for strippers and prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in on-campus housing. In the latter case, N.C.A.A. adjudicators accepted Pitino’s insistence that he had been unaware of the situation but insisted that association rules dictated that he keep closer watch over his program. What finally ended his tenure at Louisville, however, were the revelations about corruption in college sports recruiting that were unveiled by federal prosecutors in September 2017. One of three complaints centered on a Louisville recruit whose family, prosecutors said, was to have been funneled $100,000 from Adidas, which is Louisville’s apparel sponsor. At a trial this year, two former Adidas employees and an aspiring agent were convicted on fraud charges, and the recruit’s father testified that Pitino’s former associate head coach had given him a few thousand dollars in cash. Louisville and Pitino are litigating a dispute over tens of millions of dollars that Pitino says he is owed under his contract, which ran through 2026. Louisville insists it does not owe him anything because it justifiably fired him for cause. Panathinaikos is a basketball power in Europe, having won the continent’s major championship, the Euroleague, six times, most recently in 2011. This season, though the team is undefeated in the Greek league, the more important Euroleague has been a disappointment, with the team sitting in 10th place at 6-7, out of the eight playoff spots. The team includes several American players, including Deshaun Thomas of Ohio State and James Gist of Maryland, both N.B.A. second-round picks, and Keith Langford of Kansas, who is arguably the team’s star. The most notable name on the team, however, is Thanasis Antetokounmpo, the 26-year-old older brother of Giannis, the Milwaukee Bucks star. Thanasis appeared in two games for the Knicks in the 2015-16 season. Correction:  An earlier version of this article misstated the number of times the Providence men’s basketball team has been to the Final Four. It is two, in 1973 and 1987; 1987 was not its first.

sport Andrew Luck Leads the Colts to a Wild-Card Win Over the Texans - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Andrew Luck Leads the Colts to a Wild-Card Win Over the Texans Supported by Colts 21, Texans 7 Andrew Luck Leads the Colts to a Wild-Card Win Over the Texans Image Andrew Luck threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns against the Texans in Houston, the city where he grew up.CreditCreditMark J. Rebilas/USA Today Sports, via Reuters By The Associated Press Jan. 5, 2019 HOUSTON — A year ago at this time, Andrew Luck was at home struggling with an injured shoulder that cost him the entire season. On Saturday, he wrote a happy ending to the latest chapter of his comeback season, throwing for 222 yards and two touchdowns as the Indianapolis Colts raced out to a big first-half lead, then cruised to a 21-7 win over the Houston Texans in the A.F.C. wild-card game. Luck put on a show in his hometown, in a stadium where he had attended games throughout childhood and played in since high school, throwing for 191 yards and two touchdowns before halftime to help the Colts (11-6) build a 21-0 lead. He denied feeling “at home” at NRG Stadium but admitted to having warm feelings for the city he grew up in, where his grandparents and many friends still reside. “But it’s still an away stadium,” he said. “It was very loud, very energetic, but fun to win, certainly.” Running back Marlon Mack had 148 yards and a touchdown for Indianapolis, which advances to face the top-seeded Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round next weekend. “We know we have an elite quarterback, and we can throw it for 400 and win when we have to,” Indianapolis Coach Frank Reich said. “But the margin for error in playoff football when you try to do it that way is very thin. When you can win like this — running the football and stopping it — that’s just everything.” Houston (11-6), which overcame a 0-3 start to win the A.F.C. South, gave up too many big plays and couldn’t get anything going on offense in the first half, falling into a huge hole. Deshaun Watson, who was sacked an N.F.L.-leading 62 times in the regular season, was sacked three times and hit eight more in a disappointing playoff debut. He finished with 235 yards passing, a touchdown and an interception. “Just a lack of execution on our part,” Watson said. “We didn’t make plays. I didn’t make plays. Communication was a little off. You just got to give the Colts the credit.” The Colts, who opened the season 1-5, continued an impressive run by winning for the 10th time in 11 games. Saturday was their first playoff appearance since the A.F.C. championship game loss at New England at the end of the 2014 season — the so-called “Deflategate” game. Luck played another good game in a splendid season. He threw for 4,593 yards and 39 touchdowns in the regular season after missing all of 2017 with a shoulder injury. The Texans didn’t score Saturday until rookie Keke Coutee grabbed a 6-yard touchdown pass to cap a 16-play, 89-yard drive that included a fourth-down conversion. That score cut it to 21-7 with about 11 minutes left. Houston led the N.F.L. with nine comeback wins this season, but their attempt at a rally ended on their next possession. Watson’s pass on fourth-and-10 from the Indianapolis 24 fell short with about four minutes left. Luck threw for 863 yards with six touchdowns as the teams split two meetings in the regular season. He picked up right where he left off in this one, when he found Eric Ebron on a 6-yard touchdown pass on the Colts’ first drive. That play was set up by a 38-yard catch by T. Y. Hilton, who had 63 yards receiving on that drive. Hilton didn’t have any catches on the next drive, but the Colts still drove down the field easily and made it 14-0 on a 2-yard run by Mack later in the first. Houston went for it on fourth-and-4 from the Indianapolis 45 on its second possession, and Watson was intercepted by Kenny Moore II. It was Watson’s first interception since he threw two against the Redskins on Nov. 18. The Colts got to the 17 after that, before J.J. Watt deflected Luck’s pass and he was intercepted by Brandon Dunn. But the Texans couldn’t move the ball and had to punt. Indianapolis pushed the lead to 21-0 when Luck connected with Dontrelle Inman on an 18-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. “It’s very frustrating when they’re able to execute and get their job done,” Watt said. “We had a couple of big penalties early in the game, as well. But you have to overcome it, and you have to find a way to win.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Luck Shines as Colts Top Texans.

Just like Cal did against the Cardinal in 1982, the Dolphins found themselves down late and needing a touchdown to win. And like Cal, they knew they wouldn’t get in the end zone with just one player carrying the ball. The Dolphins win on a miracle TD! pic.twitter.com/5UjWO8WXvY— Athlete Swag (@AthleteSwag) December 9, 2018 In this 2018 version, which was pulled off at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium, Ryan Tannehill took the snap at Miami’s 31. He threw 14 yards to Kenny Stills, and as the wide receiver absorbed some contact from Jonathan Jones, the broadcast team declared “this will end it.” Stills, though, showed terrific awareness of the field, turning and lateraling the ball to DeVante Parker, who carried it just a bit before pitching the ball to Kenyan Drake. The play still seemed likely to end in failure, but Drake, a running back, broke a tackle, cut left, got a tremendous block to give him some room, and then cut back to his right and streaked down the sideline and into the end zone. He easily outran Rob Gronkowski, the Patriots’ tight end who had been in on defense to help in deep pass coverage. The play also harked back to the Dolphins’ past, when running Tony Nathan took a lateral from receiver Duriel Harris and ran 25 yards for a touchdown at the end of the first half of the Epic in Miami divisional playoff game against the San Diego Chargers in the 1981 season. The Chargers won that one in overtime, however. “Those guys executed it as well as you could,” Dolphins Coach Adam Gase said of Drake’s touchdown. “When you practice it, you don’t really know how it’s going to turn out. Kenyan realized he had a lane and took it.” The victory kept Miami’s slim playoff chances alive. The Dolphins fell behind on the first drive of the game when New England fullback James Develin scored on a 2-yard run. But Miami answered with a 75-yard drive that culminated in Tannehill finding Stills for a 7-yard touchdown. That is how the game would continue to play out, with New England repeatedly seeming to take control only for Miami to fight its way back into a lead. Tannehill completed 14 of 19 passes for 265 yards and three touchdowns, outdueling Tom Brady despite the five-time Super Bowl-winner throwing for 358 yards and three touchdowns. Miami’s offense seemed to succeed by throwing everything it had at New England. The ageless Frank Gore rushed for 92 yards, the former Patriot Brandon Bolden ran in two touchdowns, and Stills had 8 catches for 135 yards and a touchdown. The Patriots’ Stephen Gostkowski missed an extra point for the first time in 38 tries this season early in the game, and he also missed a 42-yard field goal try. But his 32-yarder to cap a 55-yard drive put the Patriots ahead 30-28 with 6:45 left. Coach Bill Belichick opted to have Gostkowski kick a 22-yarder in the closing seconds rather than pin the Dolphins near their goal line. Instead, they returned the ensuing kickoff to the 31 — and on the next play pulled off a miracle. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 9-4, losing ground to the Kansas City Chiefs in the race for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The win gave Miami some hope of getting a wild-card spot, though it will be a tough slog as several teams are bunched up with 7-6 records. Brady broke the N.F.L. record for career touchdown passes including postseason games and now has 582, three more than Peyton Manning. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

It couldn’t have come at a better time for the Cowboys. With his team leading by 3 points and looking to put the game out of reach, Prescott took the snap on third down at the Seattle 16-yard line, 14 yards from a first down. Settling for a field goal would give the Seahawks a chance to win. Dallas needed that first down. Seattle’s defense was set up for a pass, so Prescott took a few steps back, then charged forward. He found the seam and scooted past the first-down marker. He was tripped up around the 3-yard line, did a somersault and landed just short of the goal line. Two plays later, he again ran the ball, this time for a touchdown that gave his team a 10-point cushion — just enough for the Cowboys to hold on for a 24-22 victory. It was the first playoff win for Prescott and the Cowboys’ first postseason victory in four years. Run @Dak Run! #WPMOYChallenge + Prescott#FinishThisFight pic.twitter.com/ralOsZ63MQ— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) January 6, 2019 “He took it on his shoulders,” the Cowboys’ owner, Jerry Jones, said of Prescott. “He made plays that put us in a position to come out like we did. That’s what you want from your quarterback.” Jones, Prescott and the Cowboys will face the Rams in Los Angeles next weekend in the divisional round of the playoffs. It won’t be easy. The Rams are even more dominant at home than they are on the road. Everything seems to be bigger in Texas, including expectations for the Cowboys. In football-mad Texas, Cowboys fans, rightly or wrongly, view anything but a championship as a lost season. The only problem is the Cowboys haven’t won a Super Bowl since 1996. Fans in places like Cleveland and Minnesota would love to have this problem. But Cowboys fans know that their team’s win on Saturday was just its fourth playoff victory since Jones collected his last Vince Lombardi trophy. Over that time, quarterbacks like Chad Hutchinson, Quincy Carter and Jon Kitna have failed to lead the team back to the promised land. Tony Romo, who lasted a decade, led the Cowboys to the postseason, where his teams flamed out. Image Prescott embracing Ezekiel Elliott after scoring in the fourth quarter.CreditTom Pennington/Getty Images Enter Prescott. Jones, who is famously involved in player personnel decisions, signed off on choosing Prescott in the fourth round of the 2016 draft. Jared Goff (Rams), Carson Wentz (Eagles), Paxton Lynch (Broncos) and several other quarterbacks were drafted ahead of Prescott. Thus far, Prescott, 25, might be the best of the bunch. Goff has gaudier passing statistics, but Prescott has been clutch, with 15 game-winning drives, tied with Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson for most in a quarterback’s first three seasons. Like Wilson, Prescott can run the ball. He scored six rushing touchdowns in each of his three seasons. Of course, a big part of Prescott’s success depends on running back Ezekiel Elliott, who has led the league in rushing two of his three first seasons. On Saturday, Elliott ran for 137 yards and a touchdown and caught four passes for 32 yards. Prescott was solid, completing 22 of 33 passes for 226 yards and a touchdown. After three quiet games, wide receiver Amari Cooper came alive with 106 receiving yards. Wide receiver Tavon Austin played a key role, setting up one score with a 51-yard punt return. But Cowboys fans will remember Prescott’s run up the middle. Elliott called his performance “legendary,” which even by Texas standards seemed to be a stretch. “I’m three years in,” Prescott said sheepishly. “For him to say that, I’ll have to tell him not to say that again, or wait until later.” Later might be next weekend. The Rams’ defense ranked in the middle of the league in points given up. But they scored more than 500 points this season. Goff has a top-ranked running back behind him in Todd Gurley, as well as a selection of fleet-footed receivers. The Cowboys defense, led by linemen Randy Gregory and DeMarcus Lawrence, and rookie linebacker Leighton Vander Esch, gave up the seventh fewest yards per game this year. It will be up to Prescott, though, to figure out how to outscore the home team. Otherwise, Saturday’s victory will fade from view and his gutsy run forgotten, something Prescott seems to understand. “My goal is bigger than one playoff game,” he said.

sport 12 Teams, One Goal: A First Look at the N.F.L. Playoffs - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|12 Teams, One Goal: A First Look at the N.F.L. Playoffs Supported by On Pro Football 12 Teams, One Goal: A First Look at the N.F.L. Playoffs Image Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are in pole position in the A.F.C. CreditCreditCharlie Riedel/Associated Press By Bill Pennington Dec. 31, 2018 The N.F.L. regular season concluded Sunday night, a 17-week march that whittled a 32-team league to a 12-team playoff field with an impressive geographic reach. From Seattle to New England, with representatives from multiple regions around the country — including two teams each from Texas and Los Angeles — the dozen teams left standing for the monthlong postseason are a diverse lot. But that does not mean they are all equal. Not by a long shot. Recent history suggests the playoffs are stacked in favor of just a few teams. The edge has consistently gone to those who have earned the highest seeds in the A.F.C. and N.F.C. (teams are ranked from one to six by conference). Significantly, a top seeding comes with a prized home field advantage until the Super Bowl as well as a bye in the opening week of the playoffs. Each of the last five Super Bowl winners began their journey throughout the playoffs as a No. 1 seed. Nine of the 10 teams that played in those Super Bowls were No. 1 seeds. That would mean that this year’s top seeds, the New Orleans Saints in the N.F.C. and the Kansas City Chiefs in the A.F.C., are the principal favorites this season. And they are. But there are disparities in the makeup of every N.F.L. playoff field that cannot be measured by rankings. For example, while it’s true that top playoff seeds have dominated the last five seasons, after the 2012 season, the fourth seeded Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl. A year earlier, the Giants, who with a 9-7 regular season record were lucky to get a fourth seed, upset the top-seeded New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. After 2010, the Green Bay Packers became the first sixth seed to win the Super Bowl. The fact is, this season is like any other season: The last team standing is not always the one that has played the best through 17 weeks but the one that plays the best across four weekends of games in January and February. And this year, like every year, some teams are roaring into the playoffs while some are stumbling, or at least backpedaling, into the postseason. Some of this was evident Sunday. Was there, for instance, anything more predictable than the Patriots’ season-ending 38-3 demolition of the Jets? Playing at home in Foxboro Stadium, New England (11-5) clinched an A.F.C. second seed and earned a first-round bye with a game that seemed snatched from a 2001 time capsule. Tom Brady threw four touchdown passes and the Patriots did not have a turnover while they forced the Jets to cough up three fumbles. New England’s stars are unquestionably beginning to show their age, but the Patriots still won four of their last six games and would have won a fifth game in that stretch if not for a multiple lateral, last-second miracle play in Miami. Image Dwayne Washington and the Saints are the top seed in the N.F.C.CreditBill Feig/Associated Press The Patriots can never be discounted, even if they might have to travel to reach the top postseason prize. Because no one franchise has cast its persistent shadow over the Super Bowl this century like the Patriots, who have played in the game eight times since 2002. The team most likely in the Patriots’ cross hairs is, of course, the Chiefs (12-4), who throttled the ever hapless Oakland Raiders, 35-3, on Sunday. The magical quarterback Patrick Mahomes started slowly but eventually ran around and flung astounding passes to seven receivers. The young, dynamic Chiefs will be an intimidating presence for any team visiting Arrowhead Stadium, but they will also spend most of the next two weeks answering questions about their two defeats in the last three weeks. And the Chiefs nearly lost at home to the Ravens four games ago. Then there’s Kansas City’s 1-10 record in playoff games since the 1993 season. With two losses in the last four games, the third-seeded Houston Texans (11-5) have likewise seen a pause in the momentum they built with a nine-game win streak after a 0-3 start. The Texans easily manhandled dysfunctional Jacksonville Sunday, and they have a formidable multidimensional talent in quarterback Deshaun Watson. They will play at home on Saturday against the Indianapolis Colts, who earned the sixth seed with a 16-point victory over Tennessee on Sunday night. The Colts (10-6) are perhaps the league’s hottest team, having won their last four games and nine of the last 10, including a victory earlier this month in Houston. The Texans will still be a favorite against Indianapolis, but Houston’s late-season struggles have led to questions about whether they can keep up with the A.F.C. elite, a group that may yet include the Los Angeles Chargers (12-4) and the resurrected Ravens (10-6). The Chargers, the fifth seed because they lost the tiebreaker for the A.F.C. West division title with the Chiefs, would probably be the most feared team in the conference if they had earned home field advantage throughout the playoffs. With a 7-1 road record, they are still going to be a daunting challenge for anyone. But the quirky Ravens, who defeated the Chargers in Los Angeles late this season, are the team that no one looks forward to playing in January. Behind the incandescent Lamar Jackson, a rookie quarterback who ran for two touchdowns Sunday and had two other touchdown runs negated by penalties, the fourth-seeded Ravens have won six of their last seven games. Baltimore is also a quizzical throwback, with a ball-control offense that acts as the perfect complement to the team’s top-ranked defense. In the N.F.C., the Saints (13-3) rested many of their starters and lost to Carolina Sunday, but that was a meaningless outcome. Of more concern might be the results in three of their four previous contests — games that high-scoring New Orleans won by only 3 points. Still, everyone in the league knows the Saints’ greatest strength is the team’s home arena, the Superdome, where New Orleans has not lost in its last six postseason games dating to 2000. Any team visiting the Superdome in this postseason will likely be a considerable underdog. That includes the second-seeded Los Angeles Rams (13-3), who lost a memorable 45-35 shootout in New Orleans in November. The Rams thumped lowly San Francisco on Sunday, but like other playoff teams who soared early this year, they have come back to earth with thudding back-to-back losses to the Chicago Bears and the Philadelphia Eagles in early December. Third-seeded Chicago (12-4) and sixth-seeded Philadelphia (9-7) will meet Sunday in Chicago, where the home fans haven’t seen their Bears win a playoff game since 2011. The Eagles, the N.F.L.’s defending champions, were enduring a forgettable season until they were revived by a late-season three-game win streak led by backup quarterback Nick Foles, who engineered a similar rebirth a year ago. In Dallas on Saturday night, two surging teams in the N.F.C. will meet when fifth-seeded Seattle (10-6) visits Dallas (10-6), the fourth seed. Each team has won four of its last five games, although both teams had to rally to squeeze out narrow victories on Sunday. Seattle, which won the Super Bowl in 2014, will be making its 12th appearance in the N.F.L. playoffs this century. Dallas enters the postseason with a more ignominious recent history. The Cowboys are chasing their first Super Bowl victory since 1996.

sport Mets Appear Near a Deal for Robinson Cano and Edwin Diaz - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Mets Appear Near a Deal for Robinson Cano and Edwin Diaz Supported by Mets Appear Near a Deal for Robinson Cano and Edwin Diaz Image Robinson Cano, 36, hit .303 last season, but played in only 80 games because of a fractured hand and a suspension related to a positive test for a banned substance.CreditCreditMichael Ainsworth/Associated Press By James Wagner Nov. 30, 2018 In explaining the Mets’ hiring of Brodie Van Wagenen as their new general manager, Jeff Wilpon, the team’s chief operating officer and one of its owners, said the new architect was creative and aggressive. A month into the job, Van Wagenen appeared close to making a risky, bold trade on Friday that would signal the Mets’ expectation of contending for a playoff spot next season. Seeking a veteran hitter and a proven reliever after a second consecutive losing season, the Mets were inching toward acquiring Robinson Cano, the aging star second baseman, and Edwin Diaz, a young standout closer, from the rebuilding Seattle Mariners, according to multiple people familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly because the trade was not final. They said the Mariners would receive two prospects who were first-round draft picks and two underperforming veteran players. A framework of the trade was in place Friday, but, if completed, it might not be announced until next week because of remaining hurdles, like the medical reviews and money changing hands. The trade was complicated partly because of money owed to Cano, an eight-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $240 million contract with the Mariners five years ago. Van Wagenen, a former agent, helped negotiate the deal. Cano hit .303 last season, and he has generally been a durable player, but there are red flags: He is 36 and coming off a season in which he played only 80 games because of a fractured hand and a suspension related to a positive test for a banned substance. To seal a deal that would reduce their remaining commitment on Cano’s contract — five years and $120 million — the Mariners packaged him with Diaz, who could have yielded a significant return by himself. To offset Cano’s salary, the Mariners are expected to send an unspecified sum to the Mets. Cano, who has said he loved New York when he was a Yankee from 2005 to 2013, would have to waive his no-trade clause to assure the deal. In return, the Mets are expected to give up two of their top prospects — outfielder Jarred Kelenic and pitcher Justin Dunn — plus a minor league relief pitcher, Gerson Bautista. To help balance their costs, the Mets are expected to send the Mariners two veteran players whose contracts expire much sooner than Cano’s: outfielder Jay Bruce ($28 million over two more years) and relief pitcher Anthony Swarzak ($8.5 million for next year). Image Reliever Edwin Diaz, 24, recorded 57 saves last season with the Mariners.CreditStephen Brashear/Getty Images The proposed deal was seen across the industry as daring and puzzling. Trade rumors surrounding Cano and Diaz swirled throughout the week, as the Mariners tear down their roster under General Manager Jerry Dipoto. Diaz is one of the best closers in baseball. He saved a major-league-high 57 games last season, with a 1.96 earned run average and 124 strikeouts over 73⅓ innings, and earned his first All-Star nod. Diaz, 24, will be under team control for four more seasons. The Mets, who had one of the worst bullpens in baseball last season, could have signed one or two older relief pitchers on the free-agent market and spared their improving farm system. Elite closers, while essential for those pushing for the playoffs, are seen as luxuries on struggling teams. If the Mets — who finished 77-85 last season — hope to take full advantage of Diaz, they will need to patch the remaining holes in their roster. The deal with Seattle would leave several doubts, because of Cano’s suspension and age, and because relief pitchers like Diaz are often volatile from year to year. At his best, Cano is a .300 hitter who can also produce 20-plus home runs, drive in 100 runs and get on base often — a skill needed in the Mets’ lineup. He is likely to end up at second base, with the potential to play occasionally at first and third. Cano’s arrival would probably push Jeff McNeil, the second base prospect who performed well late last season, to third base (sharing it with Todd Frazier) or into a utility role. In Bruce and Swarzak, the Mets would be giving up two of the players over 30 they signed last winter at what was thought to be discount prices. Bruce had one of his worst seasons, suffered a hip injury and hit .217 with nine home runs, while Swarzak dealt with injuries and posted a 6.15 E.R.A. in just 29 games. As for the prospects, the Mariners were high on Kelenic entering the June draft, but the Mets nabbed him with the sixth overall pick, eight spots before Seattle picked. Although Kelenic is just 19, several talent evaluators, including some for the Mets, are enamored of his potential. There is less consensus on Dunn, 23, the 19th overall pick in 2016, but he showed improvement last season with Class AA Binghamton and raised his stock. Bautista, 23, is a hard-throwing relief pitcher with wayward command who was acquired by the Mets in their 2017 trade of relief pitcher Addison Reed.

sport Four More N.F.L. Coaches Get the Ax, Including Marvin Lewis - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Four More N.F.L. Coaches Get the Ax, Including Marvin Lewis Supported by Four More N.F.L. Coaches Get the Ax, Including Marvin Lewis Image Marvin Lewis was fired after 16 seasons.CreditCreditDon Wright/Associated Press By Victor Mather Dec. 31, 2018 When the N.F.L. regular season ends, a new season immediately begins. The postseason? No, not yet. First comes the brief but brutal annual season of firing coaches. Four teams dismissed their coaches on Monday: Marvin Lewis was fired by the Bengals, Vance Joseph by the Broncos, Steve Wilks by the Cardinals and Adam Gase by the Dolphins. News of the four firings came out in a short window on Monday morning, a particularly ugly hour or two for the members of the N.F.L. coaching fraternity. Joseph, Wilks and Lewis are black, leaving the number of black head coaches in the N.F.L. at two, Anthony Lynn of the Chargers and Mike Tomlin of the Steelers. Lewis leaves the Bengals after 16 seasons that included seven playoff appearances. But he lost all seven of those playoff games and just completed a third straight losing season, at 6-10. He was hamstrung in part by an injury to quarterback Andy Dalton that put Jeff Driskel in the starting lineup. Perhaps more important to Bengals fans: Lewis never managed to lead his team out of the long shadow of the archrival Steelers in the A.F.C. North. His regular-season record against Pittsburgh was 8-24. Joseph took over a Broncos team that had made the playoffs in five of the previous six years and was two years removed from a Super Bowl win. But he was unable to help the team navigate the transition to the post-Peyton Manning era. The Broncos were 5-11 and 6-10 under Joseph, their first back-to-back losing seasons since 1971-72. Case Keenum was far from the answer at quarterback, putting up average numbers on his good days and finishing second in the league in interceptions. After a 6-6 start that kept them in playoff contention, the Broncos lost four straight to finish the season, falling consecutively to the 49ers, Browns, and Raiders, hardly a murderers’ row of foes. Wilks’s only season with the Cardinals ended with a 3-13 record, the team’s worst since 2000. The Cardinals were in the N.F.C. championship game three seasons ago, and had 7 and 8 wins in the subsequent seasons. The team struggled this year behind a rookie quarterback, Josh Rosen, who was unable to take the league by storm as his classmates Lamar Jackson of the Ravens and Baker Mayfield of the Browns did. The Dolphins made the playoffs in the first of Gase’s three seasons but were 6-10 and 7-9 the next two years. The once proud franchise has three playoff appearances, and no wins, since 2000. The Jets fired Todd Bowles and the Buccaneers fired Dirk Koetter on Sunday. Earlier in the season, the Browns fired Hue Jackson, and the Packers fired Mike McCarthy, who has already been mentioned as a candidate for several of the open jobs. Correction:  An earlier version of this article used an outdated term for the division the Bengals are in. It is the A.F.C. North, no longer the A.F.C. Central.

sport The Town Where the Shots Go Up, and the Records Fall - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|The Town Where the Shots Go Up, and the Records Fall Supported by The Town Where the Shots Go Up, and the Records Fall Joe Girard III is smashing scoring records at Glens Falls High School, recalling another favorite son of upstate New York who preceded him there. Image Joe Girard III averaged 50 points a game as a junior last season at Glens Falls High School and broke the New York State career scoring record. What is left to be done?CreditCreditNathaniel Brooks for The New York Times By Kevin Armstrong Dec. 26, 2018 GLENS FALLS, N.Y. — Joe Girard III, an 18-year-old senior at Glens Falls High School and a pitiless scoring machine, hurried across the school’s hardwood court, placed his inhaler on a table and started his basketball season with a passing drill. It was a recent afternoon. He looked worn. Two days earlier, he had led his school’s football team to a state title as a quarterback. He threw two touchdown passes, ran for another two scores and earned most valuable player honors. Now, at basketball practice, red dots marked where a football opponent had stepped on his left hand with his cleats. His right hand was swollen from being sandwiched between the helmets of two players. And yet today he and his teammates threw a 41-ounce basketball — almost twice as heavy as a game ball — to one another. He caught the heavy ball last. He squared up on the left wing — just inside the 3-point arc — and shot it. It went in. With that shot, Joe Girard III’s pivot to basketball was complete. “Those used to be air balls,” said Rob Girard, the team’s head coach and a cousin of the marksman. “He’s getting stronger.” Girard, who is 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, and goes by JG3, averaged 50 points a game and set the state’s career scoring mark last winter with 3,306 points. Perched atop the scoring annals, he has an enviable challenge ahead on his home court in the Adirondack foothills — the same court on which another productive scorer, Jimmer Fredette, elicited oohs and aahs not too long ago. Image Girard drew a triple team in a game against Broadalbin-Perth High School last month.CreditNathaniel Brooks for The New York Times “The question now is: What do you do after averaging 50?” his father, Joe Girard Jr., said. “He has a year to go, which is scary.” It all started at the free-throw line. As a fifth grader, Girard won a national contest by making 25 of 25 free throws. As a seventh grader, he played on the high school’s freshman team. As an eighth grader, he scored the opening basket of his first varsity game and finished with 31 points, including a pull-up 3-pointer at the buzzer to win the game. As a ninth grader, he scored 52 points in one game. As a 10th grader, he once scored 41 points, grabbed 19 rebounds and fell one assist short of a triple double. Those are absurd numbers for almost any player, much less one in high school, where games last only 32 minutes, compared with 40 in college and 48 in the N.B.A. As a junior, he recorded his first dunk in a game. His cousin Trent, who is 5-foot-5, threw the ball off the backboard to Girard to earn the assist. “There are times when you say, ‘Jesus, that’s not a good shot,’ ” Rob Girard, the coach, said. “But when he hits four out of six of them, what can you say? You go with it.” Girard fired from all over last season. He scored 60 points in a game twice and never scored fewer than 41 points as his team went 20-3. He broke his own team record when he made 12 3-pointers in a game, and he stitched together four consecutive games with 50 points or more. Image Jimmer Fredette scored 2,404 points at Glens Falls High School from 2003 to 2007, then played at Brigham Young University.CreditStreeter Lecka/Getty Images Image Girard, who has smashed Fredette’s scoring records, recently announced he would play college basketball at Syracuse.CreditNathaniel Brooks for The New York Times When defenders locked arms while trapping him after he crossed the half-court line, the coach told his star to attack the linked limbs to force referees to call a foul. With seven games left in his junior season, he surpassed Los Angeles Lakers guard Lance Stephenson’s state-record 2,946 career points. In his final game as a junior, a sectional semifinal, Girard scored 56 points. “I saw those numbers, and I couldn’t believe it,” said the retired N.B.A. player Kenny Anderson, who scored 2,621 points at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens and held the state record for 15 seasons. “In 32 minutes. Amazing. Crazy. Wild. Regardless of who he is playing, with those numbers, I was like, wow, that kid is balling.” Girard was raised by a gunner. His father scored 2,179 points at St. Mary’s in Glens Falls and Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, N.Y., and is 44th on the state’s career scoring list. He later played for John Beilein at Le Moyne College in Syracuse. The Girard name is known all over Glens Falls. The boys and the girls basketball teams are each coached by a Girard. “For good and bad, Glens Falls is known as the Girard Town,” said Joe Girard III, who has two cousins as basketball teammates. “We’re all over the place.” Another family in town scored some points, too. When he was younger, Joe Girard III rode his bike to Sanford Street Elementary School and pedaled past Ogden Street, where he could see a growing collection of trophies in the Fredette family’s window. Image Rob Girard, Joe's uncle, coaches the varsity team. Two of Joe's teammates are his cousins, and another Girard coaches the girls team. "Glens Falls is known as the Girard Town,” Joe Girard III said.CreditNathaniel Brooks for The New York Times That a single city could produce these basketball look-alikes could just be coincidence, but while Jimmer Fredette was scoring 2,404 points at Glens Falls from 2003 to 2007, he also was working as a counselor at a basketball camp in town that had been held on fall Saturdays for decades. Girard was a camper there, just as Fredette had been. Fredette’s brother, T.J., remembered Girard being called upon at a basketball clinic to demonstrate a ball-handling drill. “He zipped right through it, spider dribble and all,” he said. By the time Jimmer Fredette earned national player of the year honors at Brigham Young, in 2011, Girard, 11 years younger, was being called the next Jimmer. Girard played one season for Tony Hammel, who had coached Fredette at Glens Falls, before Girard’s uncle took over the program. Girard walks by Fredette’s framed jersey outside the gym nearly every day. “There was always something just different about Joe,” Jimmer Fredette said in a phone interview from China, where he plays for the Shanghai Sharks and in November scored 75 points in a Chinese Basketball Association game. “He’s just broken every milestone by a long shot. He is a deadeye shooter, but I work with him on his middle game: floaters, runners, shots he can be creative with in college and beyond.” Girard used to hear chants — “Jimmer’s better!” — when he missed shots, but those faded in recent seasons. Still, as they did with Fredette, college coaches are figuring out where Girard fits moving forward. One of 32 players invited to try out for the United States’ under-18 team in Colorado in June, he did not make the final cut. Playing at Peach Jam, the main event of Nike’s Elite Youth Basketball League, in July, he was less of a scorer alongside center Isaiah Stewart, one of the nation’s top-rated recruits. Twice, Girard went scoreless against better competition. “He’s got to become a little more efficient in being able to maneuver his way into shots,” said Tom Konchalski, a talent evaluator and publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated, a scouting newsletter for coaches. “He’s not a point guard, but he has intergalactic range. If he’s patient, he can have a good career.” Image A poster of Girard as a young boy sits in his room in Queensbury, N.Y., next to boxes of recruiting letters from college basketball and football programs.CreditNathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Image Some of the trophies and mementos Girard has accumulated while playing sports.CreditNathaniel Brooks for The New York Times College coaches came to town to pitch their programs in the fall. Girard’s mother, Arleen, ordered from Panera Bread for most, but she made chicken parmigiana for Mike Krzyzewski of Duke. Phil Martelli, from St. Joseph’s, told Girard he should wear Bubble Wrap, but Girard absorbed his share of blows in football as a quarterback and defensive back. “I had a shoulder problem, so I used every other part of my body to tackle a guy; got a knee to the rib,” he said, recalling a hit that took his breath away. “Felt like I was going to puke blood, but my ribs were still there, so I played on. It’s senior year. I want to help these guys out.” Syracuse basketball fans made their pitch, as well. One night after coming home from a football game on the road, his mother noticed a round orange object glowing by their house. It was just before Halloween, but it didn’t seem right. “I thought our neighbor put an inflatable pumpkin on the front yard,” she said. “As I got closer, I saw the thing with a spotlight on the front and realized it was an inflatable Syracuse mascot. I panicked, got out, and tried to unplug it. I was thinking, What if other coaches saw photos? He hadn’t committed yet!” Girard later announced, in a ballroom at the Queensbury Hotel, that he would attend Syracuse. After a news conference, he called Gerry McNamara, the assistant coach who had recruited him. He treated the offer like a marriage proposal. “I do,” Girard said. Image Girard's home court.CreditNathaniel Brooks for The New York Times The bromance moved to the back burner as Girard started his senior season. In the opener, he struggled to find his stroke. He missed his first free throw, but made his second. He then missed his first 11 tries from beyond the 3-point line before making one with 30 seconds left in the third quarter. He finished with 34 points in a 92-57 win. “Still getting my legs,” he said. He found them soon after. In his next game, he scored 41 points. In his third, 53. In his fourth, he missed his first six 3-point attempts and shot an air ball. Opposing fans chanted, “Overrated!” He motioned for them to raise the volume. Before sitting out for the last three minutes of a 96-65 victory, he had scored 57 points. “You lit it up,” his father, who tallies each point in his head and checks the score book after each game, told him. “Beyond lit up!” On a recent morning, Girard pulled up a chair at Poopie Di Manno’s Lunch, a greasy spoon with a salty owner. He ordered chocolate milk and a breakfast sandwich. As the waitress retreated to the kitchen, Marcia Winslow approached him. “I don’t want to interrupt you,” Winslow said. “But before you get superfamous, can you just give me a signature? You’re totally awesome.” “Thank you,” he said as he signed her menu. Winslow explained that she had a shrine to Jimmer Fredette in her house, a wall of things he had signed, including pictures. “Maybe you’re going to replace him,” she said. “I hope so,” he said. “We’ll see.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Something in the Water?

sport Steady Amid Another Anfield Storm, Liverpool Advances in Champions League - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Soccer Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Soccer|Steady Amid Another Anfield Storm, Liverpool Advances in Champions League Supported by On Soccer Steady Amid Another Anfield Storm, Liverpool Advances in Champions League Image Mohamed Salah scored the goal Liverpool needed, the goal that delivered its 1-0 win over Napoli on Tuesday.CreditCreditJon Super/Reuters By Rory Smith Dec. 11, 2018 LIVERPOOL, England — Liverpool, Jürgen Klopp had said, needed Anfield. It needed to find fuel in the floodlit memories that swirl around this stadium. It needed its fans to turn the visit of Napoli into another of those nights that burnishes this place’s legend: another St.-Étienne, another Borussia Dortmund and, most of all, another Olympiakos. The parallel, after all, was clear, obvious. The situation was exactly as it had been when the Greek champions traveled here in 2004: Liverpool had to beat Napoli by 1-0, or otherwise by two goals or more, to qualify, to avoid the indignity of elimination at the Champions League’s group stage. For Liverpool, the past is comfort, and it is inspiration. Anfield feels a compulsion to live up to its own lore on occasions like this, each successive generation determined to meet the standards set by its predecessors, to create its own version of the stories that have been passed down to them and into myth. On these nights, Anfield regards itself as an active participant in the drama: deafening, crackling, pulsing with energy, possessed of a power to alter the result. Those games — St.-Étienne and Dortmund and Olympiakos — are remembered as much for the atmosphere they generated as the action they produced. They are recalled almost as much as Anfield’s triumphs as Liverpool’s. Staring at elimination, Klopp wanted to harness that. He wanted a night in which Anfield is as Anfield sees itself. He wanted the noise and the fervor and the frenzy. He wanted, most of all, the chaos. “If something special is possible, it’s here,” he had said the day before the game. Ever since he arrived in England, Klopp has made a point of spending a little time during games coaching his crowd. The sight of him turning away from the field to encourage the fans at his back to raise the volume has become a frequent — and occasionally a slightly grating — feature of match days at Anfield. In part, that is because of his own background: His previous job, of course, was at Dortmund, where the noise washes down the Yellow Wall, arguably the most intimidating grandstand in European soccer, and the whole place seems to shake. One of the key factors in Klopp’s taking the Liverpool role was his sons’ experience of Anfield as tourists, their testimony that he would find here what he had there. He discovered, soon after arriving, that it did not always meet his expectations, and he decided to do something about it. But it is also, partly, because for some time Anfield’s reputation has been one of the most potent weapons at Liverpool’s disposal. This is a team that has needed its fans to make up for its shortcomings, to level the playing field, to fire its players and to burn its opponents. It has needed the noise and the fervor and the frenzy. That it has been involved in so many dramatic, last-minute scrapes, victories snatched from the jaws of defeat, is because it is only in chaos — when the natural order of things has broken down — that Liverpool, against more illustrious, more accomplished opponents, has been able to thrive. To some extent, Klopp got what he wanted on Tuesday. Anfield delivered the noise he had demanded. Liverpool won, 1-0, and took its place in the knockout rounds of the Champions League, once again ensuring that the Premier League has a full complement of four teams in the last 16 of Europe’s most exclusive club competition. But this was not a night in Anfield’s grand old tradition. This was not the visit of Dortmund in 2016, when Liverpool needed three goals in half an hour to survive. It was not Olympiakos in 2005, when Steven Gerrard had to intervene in the dying minutes to send Liverpool through and mayhem swept through the Kop. This was not a victory for Anfield, and chaos. It was a victory for Liverpool, and control. By any measure, Klopp’s team has made a remarkable start to the season. Its European form has been patchy — “not good enough,” as Virgil van Dijk, the defender, said on Monday — but it has been almost flawless in the Premier League. It has not been beaten in 16 games. It has dropped points only away to Chelsea and Arsenal, and at home to Manchester City. Only four teams in English history — the history that starts in 1888, not the history that starts in 1992 — have had better records at the same stage. It sits top of the Premier League, ahead of City by a point. And yet it has done so with as little fanfare as a team as widely supported, as keenly scrutinized and as intensely followed as Liverpool can manage. City helped, of course: Until its defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, its record had been even more impressive. But Liverpool’s performances have contributed, too. This has not been the swashbuckling team that made it to the Champions League final last year, scoring bunches of goals in breathtaking surges. It has not asphyxiated its opponents with Klopp’s signature high press. It has not blown teams away. It is only a slight exaggeration to say it has managed to stay unbeaten for 16 games without actually appearing to play especially well. Only, though, when judged against what it was, rather than what it is. This Liverpool is not that Liverpool. It is not swarming opponents because it is not trying to swarm opponents. It is not sweeping teams away in 10-minute spells because it is designed to pick them apart over 90. And it is not scoring great barrages of goals because it no longer needs to. Klopp, for all that his public image is of a coach with one distinct, nonnegotiable style, has retuned his team, and his thinking. Liverpool is now a team built as much for obduracy as explosiveness, one that boasts the most expensive defender in the world in van Dijk and, in Alisson Becker, the second-most expensive goalkeeper. It is a team that has discovered the virtue of patience, and of precision, characteristics that Klopp believes stand it in better stead of thriving over an entire season, rather than in patches. It is a team that seeks to control, not one that intends to turn all around it to chaos. It is a team that needed to beat Napoli either by a single goal to none, or by at least two goals. Last year, there would have been no choice: Liverpool would have had to welcome the mayhem and hope to come out on top. This time around, it is different: more flexible, more mature. A single goal, a brilliant one from Mohamed Salah, was all it could muster, but it was all it needed. That is not to say Klopp’s team is sterile, or dull, or lacking in ambition. Nor is it to say this was an evening of eerie calm. Liverpool still had chances — Sadio Mané, in particular, might have scored three or four — and still, in those tense final minutes, allowed two. Only the poor finishing of José Callejón, and a wonderful save from Alisson, kept Liverpool on course. Still, that is why you spend $84 million on a goalkeeper. By Anfield’s standards, it was almost a letdown. There was no stirring finale. There was only a little nail-biting, nerve-shredding drama. There was a team doing what it had to do; a team, for the most part, in control; a team that wanted all the noise and fervor and frenzy, of course, a team that benefited from it, a team that would not have it any other way. But a team that needed it? Not any more. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Anfield Mystique Powers Liverpool in Champions League.

Title in 8 Years Supported by North Dakota State 38, Eastern Washington 24 North Dakota State Wins 7th F.C.S. Title in 8 Years Image With his 49th win, Bison quarterback Easton Stick now has more victories than any other quarterback in Football Championship Subdivision history.CreditCreditJeffrey Mcwhorter/Associated Press By The Associated Press Jan. 5, 2019 A perfect ending for North Dakota State coach Chris Klieman and quarterback Easton Stick resulted in yet another championship for the Bison on Saturday. Stick ran for three touchdowns and threw for two more as the Bison beat Eastern Washington, 38-24, for a record-setting seventh title in the Football Championship Subdivision, formerly known as N.C.A.A. Division I-AA. The title is the fourth in five years with Klieman as head coach. “It was a special journey — 15-0, end it with a national championship,” said Klieman, who is 69-6 as head coach of the Bison and will move to Kansas State next season. “That’s something that movies are made out of, dreams are made out of, books are written about.” North Dakota State (15-0) has now won seven F.C.S. titles over the past eight seasons. For the first three of those, Klieman was the team’s defensive coordinator. Stick, who succeeded the Philadelphia Eagles’ Carson Wentz as North Dakota State’s quarterback, threw for 198 yards and ran for 121 in his 49th victory, claiming the most wins of any quarterback in F.C.S. history. Stick leaves with school records for total yards (11,216) and passing yards (8,693) and 129 total touchdowns (88 passing, 41 rushing). “This place is special,” Stick said. “Quarterback’s a unique position. You’re only as good as players you’re surrounded with.” As a redshirt freshman three years ago, Stick was 8-0 as a starter while Wentz was hurt. That included three playoff games before Wentz returned for the championship game, only a few months before the Eagles made him the No. 2 overall pick in the 2016 NFL draft. The second half began with the teams combining for three turnovers and three long touchdowns in less than four and a half minutes. All of the scores, including Stick’s touchdown passes of 23 and 78 yards to Darrius Shepherd, came in a span of four plays over 68 seconds. “A five-minute frenzy,” Eastern Washington Coach Aaron Best said. “It was so back and forth. It was pretty crazy,” said running back Sam McPherson, who had a 75-yard touchdown run on Eastern Washington’s only play between Stick’s two touchdown passes. “It was wild for sure. It definitely got us up, got us down.” Advertisement Site Index Go to Home Page » news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings listings & more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account news home page world U.S. politics New York business tech science climate sports obituaries the upshot today's paper corrections opinion today's opinion op-ed columnists editorials op-ed Contributors letters sunday review video: opinion arts today's arts art & design books dance movies music Pop Culture television theater watching video: arts living automobiles crossword food Cooking education style health jobs magazine real estate t magazine travel weddings more Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network tools & services N.Y.C. events guide multimedia photography video NYT store times journeys manage my account Subscribe home delivery digital subscriptions Crossword Cooking email newsletters corporate subscriptions education rate mobile applications replica edition Site Information Navigation © 2019 The New York Times Company Contact Us Work with us Advertise Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Help Subscriptions
sport Valentina Shevchenko Dominates Joanna Jedrzejczyk to Claim Flyweight Belt at UFC 231 Back YahooSports Kluber sweepstakes heating up, Sox preparing for life without Kimbrel? Valentina Shevchenko Dominates Joanna Jedrzejczyk to Claim Flyweight Belt at UFC 231 Ken PishnaMMA WeeklyDecember 9, 2018, 5:56 AM GMT Valentina Shevchenko def Joanna Jedrzejczyk UFC 231 Valentina Shevchenko showed that she is the woman to be beat in the flyweight division with her dominance of former strawweight queen Joanna Jedrzejczyk at UFC 231 on Saturday in Toronto. Shevchenko had defeated Jedrzejczyk three times previously, but all three of those bouts were contested under Muay Thai rules. Things didn’t change much as they stepped into the Octagon. If anything, Shevchenko looked even more dominant. Scroll to continue with content Ad While Jedrzejczyk quickly established an approach of darting in and out, using her quickness to try take control of the fight with quantity; Shevchenko patiently sat back, waiting for her opportunities to counter, which she did to great effect. As Jedrzejczyk darted in with lightning quick punches, Shevchenko clinched and put Jedrzejczyk on her back. The former strawweight champion was quick to regain her feet, but Shevchenko was just as quick to land a hard knee to the face as they regained their footing. Again, Jedrzejczyk tried to use her speed to her advantage, but Shevchenko was more effective in utilizing her strength advantage to wear on Jedrzejczyk along the fence.  Though Jedrzejczyk was able to escape and immediately started throwing again, Shevchenko landed a devastating spinning back kick as the opening round wore down. The remainder of the fight played out in similar fashion. Jedrzejczyk wasn’t short on motivation, never slowing, continuing to dart in and out, peppering Shevchenko with a quick jab, low kicks, and front kicks, but Shevchenko remained steady in her countering, landing the more effective shots as the fight wore on. She also continued to land takedowns. Story continues A particularly devastating takedown came not when Shevchenko caught a Jedrzejczyk kick and tossed her to the canvas, but after Jedrzejczyk regained her footing. Almost the instant they were back to their feet, Shevchenko threw Jedrzejczyk hard to the canvas, marking the point in the fight where it became nearly impossible for Jedrzejczyk to shift the momentum to her favor. Jedrzejczyk tried valiantly to take control. Midway through the fight, she nearly did when she stuck Shevchenko with a solid one-two combination and followed with a head kick, but Shevchenko quickly returned to her clinch and takedown strategy, which shifted the momentum back to her favor. Though Jedrzejczyk never slowed down, she also never really could find an answer to Shevchenko’s strength and timing, which only improved as the fight wore on.  Shevchenko slowed a bit in the final minutes of the fight, but her timing never waned. If anything, she became more selective but made up for less quantity with more power. The judges agreed, issuing unanimous scores of 49-46 in Shevchenko’s favor, naming her the new UFC flyweight champion of the world. “I was waiting for so long this moment, for those magic words,” Shevchenko said after the fight. It was Shevchenko’s second consecutive victory at 125 pounds after failing twice to defeat UFC bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes. TRENDING > UFC 231 Results: Holloway vs. Ortega (Full Results and Live Fight Stats) After reigning supreme for several years, the loss was Jedrzejczyk’s third in her last four bouts, leaving her to reassess whether she should remain at flyweight or return for another run at strawweight. Though she dominated the bout, Shevchenko gave full credit to Jedrzejczyk, almost thanking her for adding a level of validation to her UFC flyweight championship. “I am very happy that I get this belt in the fight with Joanna because she is very professional,” said Shevchenko. “It is more valor for me to get this belt from this kind of fight than any other opponent.” (Photo courtesy of UFC) What to Read Next Back Sign in Sports Home Fantasy NFL NBA MLB NHL NCAAF Soccer Golf NCAAB MMA World Cup Boxing NASCAR Tennis WNBA NCAAW Olympics Indycar Horse Racing Cycling Odds Videos Podcasts Rivals Shop Help Jobs Yahoo Sites Home Mail Search News Finance Entertainment Lifestyle Sports Fantasy Sports Weather Tech Shopping Answers Tumblr Tools Help Account Info Careers About Terms (Updated) & Privacy (Updated)

Rookie quarterback Kyle Lauletta was activated for the first time this season by the Giants on Sunday. After the first half Eli Manning posted with a 29.8 QB rating, anything was possible. Manning, who ended the day with a 65.2 rating, and the Giants survived to come away with a resilient 30-27 overtime win over the Bears at a soggy MetLife Stadium. Chicago put up 10 points in the final 1:15 of the fourth quarter to tie the game at 27. The Giants appeared disaster-bound once again. But the winning points came on a 44-yard OT field goal by Aldrick Rosas after Manning thought he was connecting on what would have been a 26-yard touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard — but Shepard could not complete the catch. “I thought we were going to have a walk-off touchdown to Shep when I let the ball go,’’ Manning said. “I put it right where I wanted it. He said he lost it in the lights a little bit.’’ That’s the way the season has gone for Manning, a lost-in-the-lights year. The Giants managed to push across three points on Rosas’ 57-yard field goal at the end of the first half, thanks to Saquon Barkley’s relentless 22-yard run that put them in field-goal position to pull within 14-10. That play helped establish a second-half plan that changed the course of the game, for both Manning and the Giants. see also Giants report card: The unit that quietly saved them Grades from the Giants’ 30-27 overtime win over the Bears... “They had a good plan the first half,’’ Manning said of the bruising Bears second-ranked points-per-game defense. “They got us into some trouble with good coverages for some of our plays,’’ Manning said. “In the second half we just made an emphasis to run the ball. They were really challenging us and taking away the pass. I think we were able to run the ball and got into some third and manageable situations. And came up with a couple of big plays.’’ Giants coach Pat Shurmur said of Manning, who lofted a 1-yard touchdown pass to Odell Beckham Jr. late in the third quarter, “I think we just got to get to some of the things he can do. We ought to always be able to lean on the run here and I think that if we can keep it kind of a run, play-action type setting, I think that’s good for any quarterback.’’ Any QB. More Barkley works wonders. So did a trick play that resulted in a 49-yard TD pass from OBJ to Russell Shepard down the middle early in the third quarter, finally giving the Giants offense a wow-factor play. All week the Giants had practiced the pass by Beckham, but with one big difference, Eli noted. “We tried to hit the corner routes,’’ Manning said. “Russell made something up and Odell hit him for a TD. Sometimes you have to draw it up in the dirt. “It was the old 60-yard check down.” see also Was this a game the Giants can one day see as a breakthrough? Not now, for sure, but someday, perhaps next season, the... Shurmur praised the Giants’ resiliency and toughness, saying that is part of the change in culture he is trying to institute for his 4-8 team that has won three of its past four games. These past 15 years Manning (19-of-35, 170 yards, one TD, one interception) has been the living, breathing example of resiliency and toughness. After having to change the way he plays because of so many offensive-line issues the past few years, Manning has taken a turn for the worse but this was nonetheless a winning Sunday. In John Feinstein’s new book “Quarterback,’’ veteran QB Ryan Fitzpatrick sums up the position. “When things go well, everyone loves you,’’ Fitzpatrick said. “When they don’t, people fall out of love in a hurry.’’ Many Giants fans have fallen out of love with Eli Manning. Will he continue to try to survive as a starting QB? After the Beckham TD throw, Manning had to do something he hasn’t done. “I have never been in that situation where someone else throws it and they are behind you,’’ Manning explained of his OBJ celebratory jump. Change is good, especially when the wolf is at the door.

He was with the Los Angeles Angels until August.CreditCreditBob Levey/Getty Images By Victor Mather Dec. 7, 2018 Two former major league baseball players, Luis Valbuena and José Castillo, were killed in a car crash in Venezuela on Thursday night. The men, both of whom were natives of Venezuela, were playing winter league ball in the country. Two other men in the car, including the driver and Carlos Rivero, who briefly played for the Boston Red Sox, survived the crash, in Yaracuy, 180 miles west of Caracas. The authorities said the car had overturned as the driver tried to avoid an object in the road. We are saddened by the tragic news that Luis Valbuena and former major leaguer José Castillo have died in a car accident. pic.twitter.com/C3nILO00SE— MLB (@MLB) December 7, 2018 The governor of Yaracuy State said on Twitter that four people found with the players’ belongings had been arrested. It is common for criminals to place objects in the road to slow down or detain vehicles in order to rob the occupants, but it was unclear if the suspects had done so or if they had come upon the accident and taken the belongings. Valbuena, 33, an infielder, played for the Seattle Mariners, the Cleveland Indians, the Chicago Cubs, the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Angels. Never a star, he contributed mostly off the bench. He hit 25 home runs for the Astros in 2015, and his best batting average was .260 the next year. He was released by the Angels in August after hitting .199. “I will miss Luis’s banter, smile, genuine love for his teammates and, of course, his bat flips,” Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said. Castillo, 37, played as an infielder in the majors from 2004 to 2008 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the San Francisco Giants and the Astros. He moved on to play for teams in Taiwan and Japan. “Luis was always smiling and was one of the happiest players in baseball,” Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow said. Both men were playing for the Lara Cardinals in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. They were traveling from Caracas, where they had won a game, back to the team’s home base, Barquisimeto. The Venezuelan league games were suspended on Friday, but the Lara Cardinals held a public memorial at Estadio Antonio Herrera Gutiérrez in Barquisimeto, where fans watched as players carried the coffins of Valbuena and Castillo around the field. Players in the league will wear black armbands in their memory. Valbuena was one of the Lara Cardinals’ best players, hitting .282 with a team-leading 22 R.B.I. The team is in first place, three games up on the Magellan Navigators.

sport Warren Wells, Star Receiver With a Derailed Career, Dies at 76 - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Obituaries Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Obituaries|Warren Wells, Star Receiver With a Derailed Career, Dies at 76 Supported by Warren Wells, Star Receiver With a Derailed Career, Dies at 76 Image Warren Wells in an undated photo. In four seasons with the Oakland Raiders, he caught 156 passes for 3,634 yards and 42 touchdowns.CreditCreditAssociated Press By Daniel E. Slotnik Dec. 31, 2018 Warren Wells, a former wide receiver who became one of the most feared deep threats of the vaunted Oakland Raiders of the late 1960s, but whose career ended after he served a season-long prison sentence, died on Thursday at a hospital in Beaumont, Tex. He was 76. His death, after a heart attack, was confirmed by his son, Gary Stewart. Wells joined the Raiders in 1967, during the waning years of the American Football League, when the team was a perennial playoff contender. Under Coach John Rauch and later John Madden, and with Daryle Lamonica and occasionally George Blanda at quarterback, the team was known for its long-bomb offense. Wells, who stood 6 feet 1 inch and weighed a little under 200 pounds, was a cornerstone of that offense, with soft hands, slick moves and breakaway speed. His presence on the field also helped free up other talented receivers, like the Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff. “It was fantastic to watch him play,” Biletnikoff was quoted as saying in a memorial to Wells on the Raiders’ website. “He has speed, he could run routes, he was so smooth, he could get on top of defensive backs so quick.” Wells helped the Raiders reach three straight A.F.L. title games, from 1967 through 1969, and the first American Football Conference championship game after the A.F.L. merged with the National Football League in 1970. During Wells’s four seasons with Oakland, he caught 156 passes for 3,634 yards and 42 touchdowns and was twice chosen for the Pro Bowl. His best season was 1969, when he led the A.F.L. in receiving yards (1,260), touchdowns (14) and yards per catch (an astonishing 26.8). Wells had numerous highlight-reel plays. One came when the Raiders were down by 6 points with seconds left in a game against the Jets in December 1970. Lamonica threw 33 yards to Wells, who was surrounded by three Jets defenders in the end zone. One defender tipped the ball, and Wells snagged it for a touchdown. The Raiders won, 14-13, after Blanda kicked the extra point with one second on the clock. But Wells’s success on the field became overshadowed by his problems off it. He was charged in a sexual assault case, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was placed on probation in 1969. After the 1970 season, he got into a fracas at a bar in Beaumont that violated his probation. He missed the 1971 season while serving a prison term for the probation violation, and though he tried to return in 1972, he was no longer in playing shape. “Warren just isn’t ready to play professional football at this time,” Madden, the Raiders’ coach, told reporters. Over the next few years, Wells was charged with drunken driving and disturbing the peace. He never played another professional game. Wells was born on Nov. 14, 1942, in Franklin, La., to Julia and Henry Wells and grew up in Beaumont. His mother was a domestic worker and his father was a mechanic. He went to Hebert High School in Beaumont and attended Texas Southern University before being picked by the Detroit Lions in the 12th round of the 1964 N.F.L. draft. Wells played in nine games for the Lions in 1964 and, after the season ended, was drafted into the Army. He spent two years serving in Alaska and joined the Raiders after his tour. In addition to his son, Gary, he is survived by a sister, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Wells dealt with dementia and alcoholism for years after his professional career and was cared for by his son and other family members, including Wells’s sister-in-law, Consetta Wells; a nephew, Wyron Wells; and a niece, Raquel Wells-Joseph. Gary Wells said that his father finally gave up alcohol for good years ago. Wyron Wells said that Wells’s brain was being checked for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease found in a number of former football players. In 1999 Wells told The Associated Press that he had to “look toward the future and quit looking back” in order to reclaim his life. “I need to forget about that period, what happened in Oakland, and get my life straight,” he said.

sport Alabama’s Toughest Competition Might Be Its Second String. Or Its Third. - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Alabama’s Toughest Competition Might Be Its Second String. Or Its Third. Supported by Alabama’s Toughest Competition Might Be Its Second String. Or Its Third. Image Coach Nick Saban, left, celebrating Alabama’s win in its College Football Playoff semifinal against Oklahoma. Saban was joined by quarterback Tua Tagovailoa (13) and safety Xavier McKinney.CreditCreditMike Ehrmann/Getty Images By Marc Tracy Jan. 7, 2019 SAN JOSE, Calif. — It was 85 degrees in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Aug. 18, and Nick Saban was feeling the heat. Midway through training camp, many of Alabama’s younger players had not progressed as Saban had hoped. A talented linebacker for the Crimson Tide, the defending national champion, had recently sustained a severe knee injury, and the prior season’s starting right tackle had broken his foot. “We don’t have enough depth, especially on defense, to afford to be able to lose those kinds of players,” Saban told a group of reporters. Then Saban was asked whether the lack of progress among the more inexperienced players worried him. And that’s when Saban, this era’s most successful college coach and recruiter, snapped. His expletive-tinged remark went viral online. “You just think we, whatever happens, we just” — um, spit — “another player,” he said. “‘Everything’s going to be perfect,’” he added facetiously. “All of our fans think that. You all think that — that’s what you write about, that’s the message you send out there.” Five months later, Saban is one win away from his seventh national title. The No. 1 Crimson Tide (14-0) will face No. 2 Clemson (14-0) in Monday night’s championship game. So in fact, everything has been perfect, or very close to it, with Alabama conjuring new, great players, seemingly out of thin air, whenever they were needed. Of all the work that has positioned Alabama to secure its sixth national title in 10 seasons — recruiting young stars, developing N.F.L.-caliber players, evolving schemes, managing games — the most unheralded might be the program’s extraordinary depth. It stacks top-ranked recruiting classes, one on top of the other, over and over and over, nearly every year. In an era when college football seasons can stretch to 15 games, increasing the risk of injury, and when rules restricting player transfers have been loosened, depth has become the ultimate weapon separating the best from the very good. Image Tagovailoa in the semifinal against Oklahoma. He took over the starting quarterback’s job during the national championship game against Georgia last year, replacing Jalen Hurts.CreditMichael Reaves/Getty Images Somehow, the highest-rated prospects in the land appear to be O.K. with that. “There’s been a major, subtle shift in college football in the last five years that the elite schools are using to their advantage,” said Gary Danielson, a CBS Sports analyst. “Crowded depth charts are no longer a hindrance to recruiting.” Brandon Huffman, the national recruiting editor for 247Sports, a high school scouting site, pointed to Rashaan Evans as a vital precedent. A linebacker ranked No. 1 in his high school class at the position, he forsook offers from elite programs where he would have started immediately and chose Alabama, where he did not start until the College Football Playoff of his junior season. After his senior year, Evans was a first-round N.F.L. draft pick in 2018. Future prospects notice such developments, Huffman said. They see that paying their dues for a couple of years at Alabama and starting only a season or two can be worthwhile down the line. “That,” Huffman said, “is why Alabama does what Alabama does.” Deionte Thompson, a first-team All-American safety who did not start until his junior season, said he had chosen Alabama because he came “from a winning background” and did not want to be “someplace where I was miserable losing.” “I was able to grow so much during the time from me not being a starter to me being a full-time starter now,” he said. “I wouldn’t trade a moment.” Not surprisingly, Clemson, the other dominant program of the College Football Playoff era, also hogs talent, creating depth rivaled only by Alabama’s. At the start of this season, Clemson replaced its starting quarterback, a senior who led the team to a conference title and a playoff berth last season, with a freshman: Trevor Lawrence, who by some measures is considered the highest-ranked recruit ever. “Those top programs, you’re going to have competition,” said Joey King, who was Lawrence’s high school coach in Georgia. “I’ve always been leery of coaches who guarantee them a chance to play. Offer them a chance to compete. That’s what Trevor wanted.” For Saban and Alabama, the most dramatic jettisoning of an established player happened during last year’s national championship game. Held scoreless through halftime, Alabama’s offense trotted out its backup quarterback — a true freshman, no less — to replace Jalen Hurts for the second half. He proceeded to throw three touchdown passes, and the Crimson Tide won in overtime. It was as if Saban had spent the entire season giving minimal playing time to this reserve, a slinging southpaw named Tua Tagovailoa, on a dare. Now Alabama players know that even a two-year starting quarterback like Hurts is not safe, not even in the middle of his second consecutive national championship game. They also know that should Tagovailoa struggle Monday night, Saban will turn to Hurts, as he did during the Southeastern Conference title game last month. Hurts came in for a struggling and injured Tagovailoa and led Alabama to a come-from-behind victory. Image Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney has the Tigers back in the championship game in part because he replaced an experienced quarterback with freshman Trevor Lawrence, right.CreditMichael Ainsworth/Associated Press Because Hurts, a junior, completed his bachelor’s degree last month, he could transfer after this season and play immediately elsewhere. Crimson Tide fans need not worry. The new backups to Tagovailoa, the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, will most likely include the fifth- and eighth-highest ranked prostyle quarterbacks among high school seniors, including Tagovailoa’s younger brother. Alabama has made countless other substitutions that have barely been noticed, because of how seamless they were. Take the two players whose injuries so agitated Saban in August. The right tackle, Matt Womack, was a rising junior, and his two replacements, Alex Leatherwood and Jedrick Wills, were five- and four-star recruits, ranked first and eighth in their class. They have been useful contributors on Alabama’s second-ranked offense. And Chris Allen’s injury could have depleted Alabama’s depth at linebacker. Except the starting unit is monstrously talented, and the backups include a former walk-on who has been with the program nearly six years, as well as a four-star recruit who is a redshirt junior. As for the future, the freshman linebacker Eyabi Anoma is rated as Alabama’s fourth-best recruit ever (Julio Jones, the Atlanta Falcons’ star receiver, is No. 3). How does Alabama do it? The trick seems to be having no trick at all: telling prospects that they will receive the opportunity only to compete, but not necessarily to play. “He’s not a big promise guy,” Billy Napier, the Louisiana-Lafayette coach who spent four seasons overseeing Alabama’s wide receivers, said of Saban. “He’s very crystal-clear about expectations.” According to Alabama coaches, recruiting this way produces a virtuous cycle. Players are inspired by the knowledge that they will see elite competition not only against other teams 12 or 15 days a year, but also every day in practice. “The amount of work relative to the amount of competition is a huge margin,” Napier said. “There’s a year-round plan for player development, often about how you practice against competition behind or in front of you at your position. Accountability and responsibility goes with that. Here comes a new wave of 45 players every year that are the most talented in the country, so there’s no room for complacency.” Tosh Lupoi, the co-defensive coordinator, said that Alabama “can only put 11 individuals out there. Those individuals are going to be the best players for that specific package.” Fighting to be one of those 11, even more than the games themselves, “is the ultimate stage of competition,” Lupoi added. “And I think that helps us perform on Saturdays.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Tide’s Never-Ebbing Talent.

sport For Brodie Van Wagenen, Everything Is on the Table in Vegas - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|For Brodie Van Wagenen, Everything Is on the Table in Vegas Supported by On Baseball For Brodie Van Wagenen, Everything Is on the Table in Vegas Image Noah Syndergaard wearing the Yankees’ pinstripes next season? Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen has entertained the idea at the Winter Meetings this week.CreditCreditMitchell Leff/Getty Images By James Wagner Dec. 11, 2018 LAS VEGAS — The Mets may have faded from relevance after a hot start last season, but the arrival of the off-season has placed them in the middle of the major-league rumor mill — especially at the annual Winter Meetings this week. Some rumblings are true, like the Mets’ interest in trading for the Miami Marlins’ All-Star catcher, J.T. Realmuto. Some ideas are simply that, like discussions with the Yankees about the Mets’ star pitcher Noah Syndergaard as part of a three-way trade — which caused a major stir when it circulated around social media on Monday night. This is all a result of the hyperactive nature of the Mets’ new general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen. Leading into his first Winter Meetings as a G.M. after a career as a player agent, Van Wagenen said Omar Minaya, a special assistant with the Mets and a former general manager, gave him some advice. “He told me to pace myself,” Van Wagenen said Monday evening. “I didn’t listen to him. I don’t sleep very much and I probably talk to too many people too often. But that’s part of my personality. That’s the fun part.” Fun, perhaps, if you are a Mets fan without an emotional attachment to any particular players. Not that the Mets hired Van Wagenen, 44, to tear down the team and rebuild. They, and he, want to compete for a playoff spot now: His blockbuster trade for second baseman Robinson Cano and closer Edwin Diaz earlier this month showed he was serious about that goal. And Van Wagenen hasn’t showed any signs of slowing down. First, let’s tackle the Syndergaard possibility. The Yankees, who were outbid for the free agent pitcher Patrick Corbin, have said they want to improve their pitching staff. While Syndergaard could fulfill that goal, the image of their young star wearing pinstripes would be hard for Mets executives, let alone fans, to stomach. But that has not stopped Van Wagenen, aggressive and seemingly unconcerned by any past Yankees-Mets trade tension, from at least kicking around a scenario, among many others, in which the Yankees would get Syndergaard and the Mets would receive Realmuto from the Marlins. Realmuto would instantly solve multiple issues for the Mets. As one of the better catchers in baseball, he would bolster their pitching and defense — a top concern for Van Wagenen — while also adding a potent right-handed batter to a lineup full of left-handers. Syndergaard, 26, had a 3.03 E.R.A. in nearly 154 innings last season and is three seasons away from free agency. Realmuto, 27, hit .277 with 21 home runs and is two years away from becoming a free agent. Image Brodie Van Wagenen has not wasted any time exploring potential deals this off-season, his first as the Mets’ general manager.CreditGregory Bull/Associated Press But it wouldn’t be simple. Aside from the typical complications of a three-way deal and the politics of a trade with the Yankees (the Mets and Yankees had some prickly trade discussions over Jay Bruce and Neil Walker in 2017), dealing away Syndergaard would seem to conflict with their goal of building around their primary strength: the starting rotation. There could be other routes to acquiring Realmuto, however. The rebuilding Marlins possess leverage because many teams covet Realmuto, but they are also motivated to trade him sooner rather than later to maximize their return. The Marlins are seeking young major-league players in return for Realmuto, and shortstop Amed Rosario or outfielder Brandon Nimmo fit that bill. “We want a trade to make us better,” Van Wagenen said. “We don’t want to make a hole that we didn’t have by filling a hole that we did have.” Fair, but could the Mets, in turn, fill any holes created by a trade with a trade or a free agent signing, like a defensive-minded shortstop or right-handed outfielder? The Mets have been operating on many fronts at once; Van Wagenen, for example, has already stated his interest in the free agent A.J. Pollock, a talented but oft-injured former Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder. Although Van Wagenen said he believed Realmuto’s trade market would pick up this week, he was looking at other plans, too. The Mets have checked in on, among others, the following free-agent catchers: Martin Maldonado, Yasmani Grandal and Wilson Ramos. The Mets met with Ramos in person here in Las Vegas on Tuesday. And to cap their to-do list, the Mets have also made acquiring more bullpen help a priority this winter. Now, it’s time to wait for the pieces to fall where they may. Perhaps something will happen this week, since the Mets’ full contingent of decision makers is in Las Vegas. Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer and part of the family that owns the team, does not regularly attend the Winter Meetings, but Van Wagenen asked him to come this time. Van Wagenen said that was because the Mets have many balls in the air, and if a trade or signing suddenly evolved, he wanted Wilpon to be on hand to assist or sign off. Oh, the possibilities.

sport Three Found Guilty in N.C.A.A. Basketball Recruiting Scheme - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index College Basketball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper College Basketball|Three Found Guilty in N.C.A.A. Basketball Recruiting Scheme Supported by Three Found Guilty in N.C.A.A. Basketball Recruiting Scheme Image Two former employees of Adidas and an aspiring sports agent were found guilty on fraud charges in a college basketball recruiting scheme.CreditCreditSpencer Platt/Getty Images By Marc Tracy Oct. 24, 2018 A jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts against two former Adidas employees and an aspiring sports agent in Manhattan federal court Wednesday after more than two days’ deliberation, concluding that it constituted fraud for the defendants to funnel money to the families of college basketball recruits in exchange for the prospects’ commitment to teams sponsored by Adidas. James Gatto, Adidas’s former head of global basketball marketing; Merl Code Jr., another former Adidas employee; and an aspiring agent named Christian Dawkins were found guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, after a three-week trial. The three men could face several years in prison. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan set sentencing for March 5, just before the start of N.C.A.A. basketball’s postseason. But the larger question is whether the verdicts will have any effect on what is still widely considered business as usual in college basketball. Current and former college sports officials say basketball operators likely are still connecting families of valuable prospects with money in violation of N.C.A.A. amateurism rules. However, some operators may be chilled by the fact that, as of Wednesday, three people involved in such a scheme have been convicted of federal crimes. Gatto’s attorney indicated afterward that his client would appeal. The allegations, first revealed in September 2017, laid bare what many had long assumed or known about college basketball at its highest levels: that its top players — who for a decade have been required to wait at least a year after high school before entering the N.B.A., and who are prohibited by N.C.A.A. rules from accepting payment beyond scholarships and related costs — were getting money under the table via a murky underworld of agents, “runners” and other interested parties. The charges in this case also further exposed the outsize influence of the major basketball apparel companies — Nike, Adidas and Under Armour — on college sports. They invest millions of dollars establishing a pipeline of loyalists that begins with their own pre-college “grass-roots” leagues, runs through college teams they sponsor and culminates in star players whom they sign to endorse their clothes, gear and sneakers. In this case, federal prosecutors said that the defendants had funneled money from Adidas to prospects who wound up at three teams sponsored by the sneaker giant: Louisville, Kansas and North Carolina State. These schools, prosecutors asserted, were victims, since they were unwittingly playing ineligible athletes, risking N.C.A.A. penalties. “As a jury has now found,” said Robert S. Khuzami, the Deputy United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, “the defendants not only deceived universities into issuing scholarships under false pretenses, they deprived the universities of their economic rights and tarnished an ideal which makes college sports a beloved tradition by so many fans all over the world.” In a statement, Adidas said it had “strengthened our internal processes and controls and remain committed to ethical and fair business practices.” Though the verdicts’ larger impact on college basketball was not immediately clear, after Wednesday the following may be safely said: There is precedent that cheating N.C.A.A. bylaws can have consequences beyond collegiate infractions. “Now you don’t just have to worry about what the N.C.A.A. does to you — you have to worry about going to jail,” said Dan Beebe, a former Big 12 commissioner who consults with conferences. There are still two other trials stemming from the charges to come, involving four assistant coaches from different major programs who were accused of plotting to direct players to various managers, including Dawkins, in exchange for kickbacks. The basketball establishment has already started reacting to the charges. An N.C.A.A. commission convened to reform the sport, chaired by Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, had its proposals implemented a couple months ago. At the same time, the college sports establishment has indicated no movement toward reforming the economic system that appeared to prompt the scheme: multimillion-dollar apparel sponsorships; huge financial incentives to win big; and amateurism rules that bar paying players. The scandal eventually may lead to the end of the N.B.A.’s “one-and-done” rule, which currently bars players from entering the draft until one year after their high school class’ graduation. Last week, the N.B.A. announced a new program in its development league designed to encourage the best would-be freshmen to skip college and instead enter the G League and train for a year while receiving a $125,000 salary. The N.C.A.A. is also expected to, at some point, investigate the schools involved for violations. Prosecutors had asked the organization to hold off on such probes as long as their own process was still playing out. Wednesday’s news also demonstrated that universities may be considered victims of fraud in a legal sense even when their employees, such as assistant coaches, are in on the schemes. There was testimony, for instance, that suggested that an assistant coach at Louisville knew that Adidas employees had arranged for money to be sent to the father of a prospect. “They’re defrauding their own organization, their own employer,” Beebe said, “because they sign off on compliance forms that indicate they’re going to comply.” Kansas Coach Bill Self announced Wednesday that Silvio De Sousa would sit out an exhibition game Thursday pending an investigation, after an attorney said in his closing argument that Self had asked that an Adidas employee arrange to pay his guardian. Rick Pitino, the Hall of Fame former Louisville coach who was fired in the wake of the charges, was also aware of the scheme involving his team, the attorney said. Neither head coach was clearly implicated in witness testimony, although text messages and phone calls suggested they were aware that Adidas associates were involved in recruiting. Pitino has denied knowledge of the plan. Self declined to comment Wednesday morning while the trial was still pending. In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Kansas’s president and athletic director said: “Some of the information we were aware of, and some is new to us. The new information needs to be evaluated and understood. We have already been in contact with the N.C.A.A. regarding trial developments and will continue to work with N.C.A.A. staff moving forward.” Louisville had no comment Wednesday. In the most prominent scheme, Dawkins, Code and Gatto worked to send $100,000 in four installments to the father of Brian Bowen II after the son, a top prospect, committed to Louisville in the spring of 2017. Munish Sood, a money manager who was initially charged before reaching an agreement with the government, testified that he was in on the plan. Bowen’s father, Brian Bowen Sr., confirmed much of the allegations in his own testimony, though he said that his son never knew about the deal, or the thousands of dollars he received from other sources related to where his son plied his ample talents. Brian Bowen II was removed from practices at Louisville when the charges came out. He transferred to South Carolina but was not permitted to play, and then entered the N.B.A draft before withdrawing to play for a professional team in Australia. The three men charged in the case had pleaded not guilty, and none of them took the stand. Their primary defense was that their behavior may have violated N.C.A.A. bylaws, but that it was not a federal crime. “N.C.A.A. rules were broken,” Michael Schachter, one of Gatto’s attorneys, said in his opening argument. “Jim and Adidas helped out financially a few families whose sons are among the most talented athletes in America. That happened.” However, he added: “The N.C.A.A.’s rules are not the laws of this country. The N.C.A.A. is not the U.S. Congress.” Correction:  An earlier version of this article misstated Robert S.

sport The Heisman Vote Is Filled With Homers - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index College Football Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper College Football|The Heisman Vote Is Filled With Homers Supported by The Heisman Vote Is Filled With Homers Image Kyler Murray of Oklahoma lifted the Big 12 trophy last weekend and hopes to lift the Heisman Saturday.CreditCreditJeffrey McWhorter/Associated Press By Marc Tracy Dec. 7, 2018 For the first time in a decade, all the finalists for the Heisman Trophy are quarterbacks. They all play the same way, too. Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins, Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray and Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa are all relatively mobile but are nonetheless steadfastly pass-first quarterbacks. And, of course, all had tremendous success this season, compiling astounding statistics and leading their teams to conference championships. Murray and Tagovailoa, who are widely considered the two top contenders in the closest Heisman race in years, took their teams to the College Football Playoff. But there is at least one sense in which all three athletes, one of whom will hoist the bronze statue Saturday night, are distinct from the others — an aspect that close watchers of the Heisman balloting process know can have an outsize impact. In a low-fat version of the Electoral College, the media members who compose the vast majority of Heisman voters are apportioned equally among six regions of the country. Each area — such as the Far West, the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic — is allotted 145 media votes. This year, each finalist’s team is based in a different region. Alabama is in the South, Ohio State in the Midwest and Oklahoma in the Southwest, making it a perfect test case for whether regional bias affects Heisman voting. The historical data, deeply explored both in academic papers and in sports debates everywhere, is clear: Indeed, it does. But not in all the ways you may think. “Results show Heisman finalists do receive higher vote tallies in their home regions on average,” concludes a paper, “The Nature of Regional Bias in Heisman Voting,” by Nolan Kopkin, a professor of African and African Disaspora Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Kopkin said in an interview that he first thought of the paper while studying economics under the Cornell sports economist Lawrence Kahn. Heisman voters may select players for first (three points) second (two) and third place (one). The winner is the top points-getter. There are 870 total media voters, plus the 58 votes of former Heisman winners and one public vote. How many players are considered finalists is determined by how close the final vote totals are. “Where major gaps exist, that’s where you get a cutoff, ” according to the website of the Heisman Trophy Trust, which administers the award. Kopkin’s paper, published this year in the Journal of Sports Analytics, studied the Heisman vote tallies between 1990 and 2016, and used equations to control for different variables and across seasons when there were different numbers of finalists. According to the study, Heisman finalists received substantial boosts from their own regions. Compared to his overall tally, the average finalist over that period received 42.9 extra points from his region. He also received 4.9 points more for every game played in a given region, including those outside his home region. And finalists lost small but statistically significant numbers of points from regions that had their own home finalists. The Heisman system does try to protect players from this bias. For one thing, within regions, states receive a number of votes approximately commensurate with their populations. California and Hawaii must split the Far West’s votes, but California gets more (there are presently no voters from Alaska). For another, the regions are roughly equivalent: Five of the six contain between 53.8 million and 65.5 million people, per U.S. Census Bureau population estimates from last year, and between 21 and 31 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision. “It’s a national collegiate award, so we’re always concerned to make sure we have the best electorate we can,” said Tim Henning, a spokesman for the Trust. If any region could claim to be disadvantaged by this process, it might be the Far West, which is the most populous, or the South, which has the most F.B.S. teams (31). There has long been a perception that players from teams on the West Coast that are not the Southern California Trojans have a longer shot at winning. “People from the West always complain theirs are not receiving enough respect nationally,” Kopkin said. “The data basically doesn’t bear that out.” Image Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa already has a national championship and is a favorite for the Heisman.CreditJohn Bazemore/Associated Press Rather, he said, finalists from the Northeast, Southwest and South on average received fewer points from other regions’ voters than might otherwise be expected. But that hurdle is not insurmountable. Ten of the past 11 winners played for teams in the South or Southwest. And ultimately, since everyone is from somewhere, regional bias in Heisman voting should cancel itself out — particularly in a year, like this one, when the top points-getters are from different regions. In contrast, Kopkin saw regional bias have a more decisive influence in, say, 1993, when the top three points-getters all hailed from the South. The overall victor, Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward, actually lost his own region to runners-up from Alabama and Tennessee. He stacked his points in other regions, Kopkin speculates, partly thanks to Florida State’s membership in the predominantly Mid-Atlantic Atlantic Coast Conference and the Seminoles’ prodigious number of nationally televised games. If there is a bellwether region, meanwhile, it is the Northeast, which is New England and New York. It contains just 34.6 million people and only six F.B.S. members (and merely two teams in the so-called Power 5 conferences). Since it rarely produces a finalist, it is theoretically freed from regional bias and therefore more likely to reflect the national dispensation. “Because of the low representation, the Northeast region tends to mirror the overall Heisman voting results,” said Daniel P. Heard, a quantitative risk analyst who began tracking Heisman voting patterns while studying statistics at Duke, in an email. Every year but one since 1998, Heard said, the eventual Heisman winner also won the Northeast. The exception was 2003, when wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald of Pitt — then of the Big East, whose members included several Northeast programs — received more points in the Northeast than the overall winner Jason White, Oklahoma’s quarterback. If the Northeast is something of an accidental kingmaker, that may be appropriate for the region in which the Heisman originated and is still handed out. “This is New York City’s chance to shine in college football,” said Dick Weiss, known as “Hoops,” a former sportswriter for The New York Daily News and the Mid-Atlantic regional representative. There is a final twist: Regional bias is diminishing. Kopkin credits the sharp increase in the number of games that are nationally televised. Dave Campbell, the Southwest regional representative and eponymous longtime publisher of a magazine about Texas football, recalled that, decades ago, sportswriters’ adjudication involved word-of-mouth and intra-jouranalistic argumentation. “You tried to get a consensus of thinking, to make sure everybody was getting a fair shot,” he said. But we are long past the days when the N.C.A.A. restricted teams to just a couple nationally televised games per season. We are now in an era when three (and soon four) conferences have their own networks, and ESPN and its affiliates can be relied upon to show games on several weeknights as well as for 12 hours on Saturdays. Replays are available for Easterners loathe to stay up late to watch West Coast games. “The voter now who claims he didn’t see someone — he should have seen someone,” Campbell said. So as we approach a blissful future in which every single college football game is broadcast to every television set, or laptop, or brain-implanted moving-picture device in the country, might regional bias fade away entirely? Maybe not. Kopkin’s data showed a sharp decline in bias in recent years — but not its wholesale elimination. “That’s still not what we see,” Kopkin said. “I don’t think we ever will. You’re still going to see voters in the South being more prone to vote for S.E.C. players.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: For Heisman, Regional Bias Holds Weight.

sport Dwyane Wade ‘humbled’ fans voted to ‘see my old self in the All-Star Game’ Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Dwyane Wade ‘humbled’ fans voted to ‘see my old self in the All-Star Game’ Kurt HelinNBC SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 1:14 AM GMT The first round of NBA fan voting for the All-Star Game is out and the fans want Dwyane Wade‘s “one last dance” to make a stop in Charlotte. If the voting were to stay this way, Wade would be an All-Star starter. Scroll to continue with content Ad Wade was humbled by that, as he told the press in Washington before the Heat beat the Wizards on Friday night (hat tip to the Miami Herald). “I just appreciate it,” Wade said in advance of Friday’s home game against the Wizards. “I’m humbled by people taking the time out to want to see my old self in the All-Star Game. It’s cool.” It’s unlikely that Wade stays as a starter. First, Wade’s 409,156 is not far ahead of popular players such as Charlotte’s Kemba Walker (319,519, and remember the All-Star Game is in Charlotte this year) and Philadelphia’s Ben Simmons (259,993). (Kyrie Irving is far out in front on the East guard vote with close to 1 million, he’s getting one spot.) Plus, the fan vote is just 50 percent of the total, the players and media votes (25 percent each) will be added to that, and those groups likely don’t put Wade as a starter. That said, it would be great to see the 12-time All-Star in the game one more time. If the coaches don’t pick him as a reserve in the East, it would be class move from Commissioner Adam Silver add a special 13th roster spot to each team, one for Wade and one for Dirk Nowitzki.

sport One Conference Is Working the System to Get More Teams in the N.C.A.A. Tournament - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Sports|One Conference Is Working the System to Get More Teams in the N.C.A.A. Tournament Supported by One Conference Is Working the System to Get More Teams in the N.C.A.A. Tournament Image Taveion Hollingsworth after Western Kentucky lost the Conference USA tournament final last March. His team did not get invited to the N.C.A.A. tournament, but next year’s runner-up might, if an innovative scheduling scheme works.CreditCreditAustin Anthony/Daily News, via Associated Press By Victor Mather Nov. 5, 2018 When fans of Conference USA men’s basketball teams look at their schedules for the coming season, they will see a curious twist in February: The dates of the games are set, but not the opponents. It is part of a new, innovative approach designed to finally get the conference an elusive second N.C.A.A. tournament bid. Conference USA, a Division I league made up of 14 teams in the South, has had a pretty remarkable run of success in recent years — in the last four N.C.A.A. tournaments, its teams have knocked off two, three, four and five seeds. But despite that, the league remains stubbornly disrespected by the selection committee. For the last six years it has earned just a single bid annually. It aims to break that cycle this season with the new schedule. Here’s how it works: • Conference USA’s teams will start with a traditional schedule, playing every other team once and a traditional rival twice. But the last four games of the season will be different. • Teams will be broken into three groups after the first 14 conference games. The top group, with the teams in first through fifth place, a middle group of teams 6-10, and a bottom group of teams 11-14. • The teams will then play the others in their group once more each. The result will be a tougher schedule for the top teams, and perhaps a better ranking when the committee meets to pick the N.C.A.A. field. Strength of schedule is always a key factor in the committee’s deliberations. “The knock on our teams has been you don’t have enough top 50 wins, top 100,” said Judy MacLeod, commissioner of Conference USA. “Well, we don’t have an opportunity to play those opponents.” Without those chances, the question becomes, she said, “How can we take our own schedule and make sure our better teams are playing our better teams?” There is a lot of money in the N.C.A.A. tournament, and the more teams a conference gets in, the more money it makes. Conference USA spreads that wealth around, as most other leagues do. So every team would benefit from a second bid if the league were able to get one. Last season, Marshall won the conference’s tournament as the No. 4 seed and earned the N.C.A.A. berth. Middle Tennessee (25-8), Old Dominion (25-7) Western Kentucky (27-11) and three other 20-win teams all had to make do with the N.I.T., or in some cases no tournament at all. Image The last five games of Marshall’s basketball schedule are T.B.A. on the team’s website. The new scheduling may help the teams that do make the N.C.A.A. tournament get better seeding as well. The last four teams to make the tournament from the conference were seeded 12th to 15th. “One of our issues is perception,” MacLeod said. “If our teams had been seeded 7, or 10 even, would they have progressed farther? Maybe the first time, we don’t get another team in, but we get a much better seed. We felt it was worth the chance to try it.” In the end, only four games for each team will be affected by the new schedule, but MacLeod said she believed that might be enough to make a difference. “Just one data point might put one team in over another.” There are pitfalls to leaving holes in the schedule to be filled later, notably travel. Conference USA has teams spread from West Virginia to Texas. Arduous road trips can be eased with careful preseason planning. But no one will know where they will be traveling in mid-February until the last minute. The conference plans to take a one-week break before the bonus games begin to try to find the best sequence of games. While teams in the top division will be the chief beneficiaries of the new scheduling, McLeod feels that every team could profit from it. “Those last weeks everyone will be playing like teams. There will be more fan engagement. Everyone will be having an opportunity to win.” Even the teams in the bottom group, ranked 11 to 14, who might be thought to face some stigma, will have something to play for. Only 12 teams make the conference tournament, and the last four games among that group should be crucial for determining those berths. The conference tournament will be mostly unchanged, but teams in the top group will not fall below a 5 seed, since it would hardly be fair for a top team to lose to several tough teams and fall behind a team with an easier schedule. As for the women, the conference will try a different plan. The full schedule will be set in advance, but each team will play its final games against teams that are expected to have similar records. “We’ll have two different models to evaluate,” MacLeod said. Splitting a league into divisions based on record is mostly unknown in the United States, but is used in some European soccer leagues, Scotland for example. “This is not a cure-all,” MacLeod acknowledged. “We’re not going to magically have four teams in the tournament. We’re looking at innovative ways to enhance our résumés.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: League Shuffles Scheduling Deck, Seeking Better N.C.A.A.

sport Mets Bulk Up Front Office With Another Former G.M. - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Baseball Subscribe Log In Log In Today’s Paper Baseball|Mets Bulk Up Front Office With Another Former G.M. Supported by Mets Bulk Up Front Office With Another Former G.M. Image Allard Baird, right, in 2004, when he was the Royals’ general manager.CreditCreditRick Bowmer/Associated Press By James Wagner Nov. 29, 2018 Part of the Mets’ message when they hired Brodie Van Wagenen as their general manager last month was that they wanted to beef up the front office around him. The analytics and player development staffs were among the areas highlighted for improvement. The Mets have kept their word. This week, the team hired Adam Guttridge and Allard Baird as assistant general managers under Van Wagenen to help oversee those two areas. Guttridge, 33, who helped found a company called Neifi (Normalized Empirical Individual Forecasting Index) that developed analytical models and consulted with major league teams, will be in charge of what the Mets call systematic development. After having worked for the Milwaukee Brewers and Colorado Rockies, Guttridge now will help build more of those analytical models throughout the Mets organization. Baird, 57, was lured away from the Boston Red Sox, fresh off their World Series title, to be the Mets’ vice president and assistant general manager for scouting and player development. Baird will be based in New York and will have a hand in the Mets’ scouting in the United States and internationally, as well as in the minor leagues. “I’m going to be all over the map, but I’ve told Brodie not to be afraid to call an audible and make an adjustment on me,” Baird said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday afternoon. “I’m here to be part of something special.” Baird, a respected executive who was part of three World Series championships in Boston, adds expertise to a front office that now has four executives with experience as major league general managers. That will help Van Wagenen, who had never worked in a front office, in his transition from his former job as an agent. Baird was the Kansas City Royals’ general manager from 2000 to 2006 before spending 12 years with the Red Sox, most recently as the team’s senior vice president for player personnel. Omar Minaya, now a Mets special assistant, was the team’s general manager before Sandy Alderson, who was replaced by Van Wagenen. Ruben Amaro Jr., a former Philadelphia Phillies general manager who was the Mets’ first-base coach last season, moved to a front-office adviser role this winter. Image Brodie Van Wagenen, a former agent with no front-office experience, this week added assistants to oversee the Mets’ analytics and player development operations.CreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times John Ricco, the Mets’ longtime assistant general manager, has served as interim general manager twice during transition periods, including the second half of last season when he led the team with J. P. Ricciardi and Minaya after Alderson stepped down. Van Wagenen and Ricco have been vague about Ricco’s future beyond saying that he remains with the team now. Ricciardi, a special assistant hired when Alderson was in charge, left the Mets this month. Baird said he was puzzled when the Mets made the unorthodox choice of Van Wagenen as their new leader in October. He said he knew that Van Wagenen was a good communicator, had good relationships with players and understood the intricacies of the sport from his time as an agent. But once he spoke to Van Wagenen about the possibility of joining the Mets, including one conversation on Thanksgiving Day, Baird was sold. “The leadership and the vision that Brodie has for the organization as a whole really played into this,” Baird said, adding, “I felt I could be a good resource for him.” Baird said the Mets, who want to contend for the playoffs next season after a disappointing 2018, have strong starting pitching but holes to patch on offense and defense and in the bullpen. He called Van Wagenen a “very aggressive and creative thinker” in how he would address those needs. Baird spoke as trade rumors swirled about the Mets’ interest in two Seattle Mariners: second baseman Robinson Cano and the All-Star closer Edwin Diaz. Adding both would be a difficult trade to pull off: Although the Mariners are rebuilding, Cano, 36, is owed $120 million over five years, has a no-trade clause and is coming off a season in which he played only 80 games because of a fractured hand and a suspension related to a positive test for a banned substance. (As an agent, Van Wagenen helped negotiate Cano’s current contract.) Baird’s skills might be needed most elsewhere. The Mets brought back Minaya last December partly to bolster their efforts in signing international amateur talent, and Baird now will aid in that effort. Continuing to improve the team’s minor league system will also be a part of Baird’s duties. Entering last season, Baseball America ranked the Mets’ minor leagues 27th out of baseball’s 30 teams. Team officials, including the principal owner Fred Wilpon, were frustrated with the development of prospects. But after more talent was injected through last summer’s draft and as younger prospects took steps forward, the ranking of the Mets’ system jumped to No. 19 by August. In only two days on the job, Baird said one area to strengthen was an emphasis on teaching, such as helping players better understand and use all the data available to them in the modern game. Guttridge will be asked to provide even more of that data: He has been asked to help improve a Mets analytics group that had only three full-time employees last season, which was among the smallest staffs of its kind in baseball. Alderson, one of baseball’s early adopters of analytics, had wanted to hire more near the end of his tenure but was blocked from doing so; instead, he filled out the group by hiring more interns. Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer and part of the family that owns the team, said in September that the reluctance to invest in the team’s lean analytics staff had been a recommendation of the previous regime.

Former Warrior Patrick McCaw played three games in a Cleveland Cavaliers uniform, averaging just 1.7 points in 17.7 minutes, since signing with the team last week. Scroll to continue with content Ad He won't be playing any more. At least for the time being, anyway. The Cavs waived McCaw on Sunday, shortly after The Athletic's Shams Charania reported that the team planned to do so. McCaw's stay lasted less than one week after he joined Cleveland on a two-year, non-guaranteed $6 million offer sheet that Golden State declined to match. Sources @TheAthleticNBA @WatchStadium: The Cleveland Cavaliers are planning to waive Pat McCaw. McCaw signed a non-guaranteed two-year offer sheet with Cleveland to leave Golden State. — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) January 6, 2019 Assuming he passes through waivers, McCaw will become an unrestricted free agent, free to sign a new contract with any NBA team (including the Cavaliers or the Warriors), although any deal he would be guaranteed as of Monday.  The NBA deadline to guarantee contracts for players on non-guaranteed deals -- like McCaw, or Golden State's Alfonzo McKinnie -- is Monday. For this reason, the timing of the transaction doesn't come as a complete surprise. Story continues The Warriors are well into the luxury tax, and if they declined to match the Cavs' offer sheet, we can assume they won't pursue McCaw once he hits the open market. Not to mention, it almost certainly would require parting with McKinnie, whom they've clearly prioritized over McCaw. [RELATED: McKinnie details how he blocked out McCaw distraction] The Cavs could remain an option, though, as could a variety of playoff contenders: Cleveland, along with several playoff contenders, are expected to express interest in signing McCaw (unrestricted free agent) if he clears waivers. Guarantee deadline for McCaw (two years, $6M) -- and other players on non-guaranteed deals around NBA -- is Monday. https://t.co/QgZOUiPLVz — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) January 6, 2019 So, it begs the question: Was this a pre-planned agreement between McCaw and the Cavs to get him out from Warriors control? Based on the timing -- and the bloated offer sheet -- it sure seems that way. Cleveland currently is 8-32, losers of nine straight, sitting in last place in the NBA. Wins have been hard to come by, but in assisting McCaw's departure from Golden State -- the team largely responsible for their implosion -- perhaps the Cavs are enjoying a small victory today.

sport Iowa Basketball Rivalry Fizzles as Big School Ducks the Upstarts - The New York Times Sections SEARCH Skip to contentSkip to site index Sports Log In Subscribe Log In Today’s Paper Sports|Iowa Basketball Rivalry Fizzles as Big School Ducks the Upstarts Supported by Iowa Basketball Rivalry Fizzles as Big School Ducks the Upstarts Image Iowa is pulling out of the Hy-Vee Classic after this year, meaning it will likely no longer have in-state rivals Northern Iowa and Drake on its schedule.CreditCreditMatthew Holst/Getty Images By Pat Borzi Dec. 14, 2018 Philadelphia has the Big 5. The state of Iowa has the Big Four — an informal confederation of Division I basketball programs, linked by geography, passion and the never-ending pursuit of bragging rights. The four-way rivalry was kindled in the late 1970s when the University of Northern Iowa joined Division I. For decades, Iowa and Iowa State, the major conference stalwarts, annually scheduled games against the midmajors Drake and U.N.I., alternating home sites each year, before the programs began playing a four-team doubleheader in Des Moines in 2012. The games are usually competitive, and fans relish them. Darian DeVries, who is Drake’s first-year coach and who grew up in the small northern Iowa town of Aplington, attended a memorable Big Four game in 1990 with his father, Vern, and younger brother, Jared (a future Detroit Lions defensive end). They were among 22,791 packed into the U.N.I. Dome as the Panthers and their high-scoring star Jason Reese upset the 20th-ranked Hawkeyes, 77-74, on the way to the program’s first Division I N.C.A.A. tournament berth. “I’m not sure we could see anything, but it was the most incredible sporting event ever,” DeVries said after a recent Bulldogs game in Minneapolis. “That was my greatest memory as a kid.” But the chance for additional memories is about to end, for the foreseeable future at least, as these cherished games seemingly fall victim to the larger programs’ concerns about upsets and not making the N.C.A.A. tournament — an approach that is bound to make it harder for midmajors everywhere to get to the tournament, too. This year’s version of what is now known as the Hy-Vee Classic at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, scheduled for Saturday, will be the last, ending a seven-year run. (Hy-Vee is a Midwest supermarket chain.) Earlier this year, Iowa announced it was withdrawing from the event. The move blindsided the other programs and, beginning in 2020, could have significant impact on which teams make the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament, whose selection committee likes so-called midmajors to have upsets of bigger programs on their résumés. Iowa appears uninterested in scheduling U.N.I., a strong midmajor with four N.C.A.A. tournament appearances since 2009, or Drake, a rival dating to 1909. And fans statewide, like Steve Nyquist, a Drake alumnus and Bulldogs season-ticket holder from Des Moines, are angry. “Almost all decisions come down to money,” Nyquist said during a recent Drake game against North Dakota State at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. “That’s my cynical belief, anyway,” Money certainly was part of it. Hawkeyes Athletic Director Gary Barta exercised a clause his university had demanded as a condition for extending the Classic — originally called the Big Four Classic — through 2019. The clause permitted a team to opt out if its conference required 22 contracted games. This season, the Big Ten Conference schedule expanded to 20 games from 18. That, plus crossover games with the Big East and Atlantic Coast Conferences, brought Iowa’s total to 22. Barta declined an interview request from The New York Times. In a statement released when Iowa announced its decision, Barta was quoted as saying that the new conference requirements “created some scheduling challenges that impacts this event” and that future games with in-state programs would be considered case by case. “Our fans are certainly upset,” said Northern Iowa Athletic Director David Harris, who was formerly the senior associate athletic director at Iowa State. He said the U.N.I. faithful would really like to return to the home-and-home schedule, which probably is not going to happen, either. “That doesn’t appear to be in the cards right now.” Image Iowa State, taking on Drake during the 2016 Hy-Vee Classic, may not play its in-state, midmajor rivals moving forward.CreditMatthew Holst/Getty Images Iowa and Iowa State, which plays in the Big 12, meet every year in a nonconference series that dates to the 1970s, alternating home sites. There are no plans to discontinue that series. The Big Four/Hy-Vee Classic began because Iowa and Iowa State refused to continue playing at U.N.I. or Drake, whose arenas seat about 7,000, significantly less than Carver-Hawkeye Arena at Iowa (15,400) and Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State (14,384). Power 5 programs load up on nonconference games at home, paying opponents guarantees of up to $100,000 for the privilege — so-called “buy” games that they usually win. Although the Classic never sold out, it drew roughly 13,000 to 15,000 in the 16,980-seat Wells Fargo Arena. Two people familiar with the finances said each program earned $125,000 or more annually from the event. Drake Athletic Director Brian Hardin, who grew up in Des Moines rooting for the Bulldogs as the son of two Drake alumni, said football had replaced basketball as the dominant sport in Iowa. “While this isn’t the major reason why, I can’t imagine that the fact that the four division schools are not playing each other is going to help bring basketball back to the prominence it once had in our state,” he said. “And that’s disappointing.” Hardin has reached out to Iowa’s Barta and Iowa State Athletic Director Jamie Pollard, hoping to get back on their schedules. Pollard declined an interview request, but an Iowa State spokesman said the team hopes to keep playing Drake and U.N.I. It may not be easy. Drake and Iowa State have met 174 times since 1908, but Hardin is not keen on the Bulldogs’ going to Ames every year, which Iowa State might insist on. Harris, the U.N.I. athletic director, said his team had not decided whether to pursue future games with Iowa State or Iowa. Drake and U.N.I. meet twice a year in Missouri Valley Conference play. U.N.I. may be a victim of its own success. Under Coach Ben Jacobson, U.N.I. has a history of upsetting top teams, making it an unpopular opponent. The Panthers knocked top-seeded Kansas out of the 2010 N.C.A.A. tournament, stunned top-ranked North Carolina at the McLeod Center in November 2015 and beat Iowa and Iowa State in the Classic in consecutive years. Jacobson said U.N.I. was already struggling to schedule quality nonconference games, which are crucial to gaining at-large N.C.A.A. tournament consideration. The demise of the Classic does not help. “The Power 5, and maybe a league or two after that, they’re going to play most of their games against each other,” said Jacobson, who foresees a tougher road to the tournament for his program and for Drake. “That’s what is bothersome.” But basketball fans in Iowa might just need to be patient. Seven years ago, four Division I programs in Indiana — Notre Dame, Butler, Purdue and the Hoosiers — revived a two-game showcase that disappeared in the 1940s, known then as the Hoosier Classic and now called the Crossroads Classic. And in Philadelphia, even the Big 5 fizzled for eight years in the 1990s, when Rollie Massimino, then Villanova’s coach, stopped scheduling the other teams every season. Steve Lappas succeeded Massimino and restored full round-robin play in 1999. For now, the state of Iowa awaits its Steve Lappas.

sport Bob McNair’s death increases sense of urgency for Jerry Jones Back YahooSports Kobe tells Lakers fans to relax on Twitter following blowout loss Bob McNair’s death increases sense of urgency for Jerry Jones Charean WilliamsProFootball Talk on NBC SportsJanuary 6, 2019, 12:57 AM GMT Texans owner Bob McNair’s death earlier this season increased Jerry Jones’ desire to win now. McNair died in November at the age of 81. Jones is 76. Scroll to continue with content Ad ”[Jerry Jones] has made it real clear during this run he would do anything he can to put his finger on it,” Stephen Jones said on ESPN 103.3 FM on Saturday, via Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ”I think the passing of Bob McNair hit home with him. Bob, this time last year was healthy and running the finance committee and just seemed fine. And when you get to be a certain age you start to understand that maybe you aren’t promised the next year “He certainly had his buzzer out, making sure all hands are on deck, so that we are doing everything we can to pull out each football game. Our backs are against the wall ever since we were 3-5, and we certainly feel like our backs are against the wall against the Seahawks. We’ve just got to go work.” The Cowboys have won only three playoff games since their last Super Bowl in 1995. They have not even made an NFC Championship Game since. Jerry Jones joked on his radio show Friday about time running out for him to get another Super Bowl ring. “I don’t have time to have a bad time. It’s not on my schedule,” Jerry Jones said on 105.3. “And, so, I’m smiling when I say that. The facts are that it does create more urgency. But it’s always been our goal to get in this game or one of these playoff games and go from here. The next thing you say is get into the playoffs with a team whose arrow’s pointed up, get into a playoff that you give yourself a chance health-wise, get into the playoffs with a motivated situation, young team in our particular case, all of those things you have in the mentality of playoffs as well. It’s a tournament.” What to Read Next Back Sign in Sports Home Fantasy NFL NBA MLB NHL NCAAF Soccer Golf NCAAB MMA World Cup Boxing NASCAR Tennis WNBA NCAAW Indycar Horse Racing Cycling Odds Videos Podcasts Rivals Shop Help Jobs Yahoo Sites Home Mail Search News Finance Entertainment Lifestyle Sports Fantasy Sports Weather Tech Shopping Answers Tumblr Tools Help Account Info Careers About Terms (Updated) & Privacy (Updated)
